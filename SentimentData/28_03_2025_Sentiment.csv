The cryptocurrency with a total value of $201,400 was traced to fundraising addresses allegedly controlled by Hamas and used to launder more than $1.5 million in digital assets since October 2024. The laundering occurred through a series of “virtual currency exchanges and transactions by leveraging suspected financiers and over-the-counter brokers,” the DOJ said. The funds are currently held in a combination of at least 17 wallets. Affidavit to seize the Hamas-linked cryptocurrency. Source: US DOJ In January 2024, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, along with corresponding organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia, announced sanctions against networks and facilitators of crypto transactions linked to Hamas. Those sanctions were built on US Treasury sanctions from October 2023. In January 2024, three families of victims of the Hamas attack against Israel sued Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao , alleging that the exchange had provided “substantial assistance” to terrorists. In oral arguments, a lawyer representing Binance claimed the exchange had “no special relationship [with] Hamas .” Binance has faced scrutiny from the US government over alleged shortcomings in its Anti-Money Laundering controls. The exchange settled with the DOJ for $4.3 billion in November 2023. More regulation needed? According to a December 2024 report by the Congressional Research Service, Hamas has allegedly sought cryptocurrency donations since at least 2019, although the “scale and effectiveness” of these efforts have been unclear. Terrorist organizations using crypto for fundraising have increasingly drawn the attention of the US, with some officials questioning whether the industry needed more supervision or regulation to stop such behavior. According to a 2023 Chainalysis report, terrorism financing accounts for a very small amount of crypto usage, with illegal groups sticking to using traditional, fiat-based methods to fund operations.

This time, the spotlight was on Token2049, a prominent cryptocurrency event that is expected to attract major industry players in three separate events later this year. The alert warned members of the group to be wary of sponsors as the event approaches because conveners typically do very little due diligence on these supporters. “Just because someone is a title or platinum sponsor does not mean they are credible,” Zach wrote. Zach blow s wh istle about shady and sketchy Token2049 sponsors The report listed Spacecoin as the title sponsor of the upcoming event, but according to Zach, it is a “botted project.” Connect with @_spacecoin , Title Sponsor of #TOKEN2049 Dubai! Spacecoin is the world’s first DePIN powered by satellites, building trustless, decentralized internet connectivity on a global scale. Learn more: https://t.co/ove4Sodour pic.twitter.com/n6DMQ1rZgm — TOKEN2049 (@token2049) March 20, 2025 A quick look at Spacecoin’s page revea ls i t is aiming to be the world’s first DePIN project that is powered by satellites. It claims its “decentralized satellite constellation provides global 5G internet access to the 2.9 billion people who remain unconnected” and has lofty ambitions of connecting the world via its satellites. The term “botted” can be interpreted in a number of ways in crypto, but none is flattering. On the bright side, its name appears alongside platforms like OKX, BloFin, MEXC, KuCoi n and Binance as “title sponsors. ” The on-chain sleuth also tagged Bitunix, JuCoin, WEEX, and DWF, which Token2049 lists as platinum sponsors as “sketchy. ” Zach pointed out in his report that the teams he mentioned are the ones on his radar for now. However, he expects the list to grow longer before the first event starts in April. For the centralized exchanges that made the “sketchy” list, Zach said he checked to verify if the team is public and has a prior work history in the space. The listed platform s including Bitunix, JuCoin, & WEE X all failed this test. Bitunix, which Zach described as a “sketchy exchange,” is an actual cryptocurrency exchange registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and it offers spot and futures trading. Some days ago , a report revealed that Bitunix is being targeted by South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) for providing services to Korean customers without proper registration. The crypto platform reportedly operates Korean-language websites and provides market and customer support activities targeted to Korean investors without notifying authorities or filing for a VASP license. JuCoin, also tagged “sketchy” by Zach, is another exchange, previously known as Jubi. It may have gotten on Zach’s radar because it has a history of ownership changes, rebrand s and regulatory pivots. Ironically, the exchange announced that it had applied for its VASP license to operate in Taiwan, stating that it “is taking the lead in Taiwan’s compliance process by officially applying for regulatory licenses, implementing KYC systems. ” Another eyebrow-raiser may be that JuCoin is not regulated in the US, EU, or other major markets with strict regulatory standards, except for an exemption from Singapore’s Monetary Authority. WEEX, another sketch y company according to Zach , is a crypto futures exchange established in 2018 and registered in Singapore. The doubts about the exchange are because it is not regulated by a financial authority with strict standards. There have also been social media posts complaining of weird behavior on the exchange, such as frozen accounts and unwarranted KYC issues. DWF, tagged as a “sketchy market maker,” is a known Web3 investor and market maker, trading on over 60 exchanges and involved in high-profile investments. It may have been included on Zach’s list because of past accusations of wash trading as a market maker and the more recent rug allegation from Vite Labs. Vite Labs made the rug allegation hours ago today, March 27, 2025. The allegation was shared on the project’s X page and claimed that “the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. ” “We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled,” the post from Vite Labs concluded . Hi guys we want to update that the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled. — Vite Labs 🏃🏻‍♂️ (@vitelabs) March 27, 2025 In the comments section of the post, people demanded more information on how DWF Labs may have rugged the fund s, but Vite Labs did not provide any further explanation. As for Binance, it claimed that it delisted Vite Labs’ token because it no longer met certain requirements. The wash trading allegation linked to DWF Labs came in May 2024. It accused the market maker of conducting over $300 million in wash trades across seven tokens in 2023, manipulating the price of Yield Guild Games’ native token , Y GG and other cryptocurrencies. Binance refuted the allegations, claiming that the transactions were proprietary and were free o f manipulati on while accusing the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors, leading to his termination. Binance has affirmed its strict market surveillance program and commitment to combating market abuse. The exchange has said that it does not tolerate manipulation practices and has dismissed nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of over $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past couple of years. The danger of sketchy platforms posing as sponsor s A sketch y character sponsoring an event, brand, or politician happe ns in all spheres of life, including crypto. It does not happen often at the Token204 9 eve nt but a case was recorded not too long ag o whi ch had disastrous consequences . Za ch in hi s repo rt highlighted one incident from late 2023 when a sketchy exchange known as JPEX was chosen as a platinum sponsor for that year’s Token 2049 conference. The team was flagged by the Hong Kong government during the conference as an unlicensed company with allegedly “suspiciou s features .” After victims made abou t 14 00 reports to law enforcement, about 70 people were arrested by the police in connection with the HK$1.6 billion JPEX cryptocurrenc y scand al and nearly HK$230 million (US$29.37 million) in assets were immediately frozen. The scandal was tagged Hong Kong’s biggest case of alleged financial fraud. Despite all the heat, the platform remained defiant, hitting users with an exorbitant fee for virtual asset withdrawals. Police Commissioner Raymond Siu Chak-yee later revea led the number of arrests related to the case had shot up t o 72 and about HK$228 million had been frozen. “The force has received 2,636 reports with regard to the case as of today, and the amount involved is about HK$1.6 billion,” he said. Among those previously arrested were social media influencers who had appeared in adverts for the trading platform and set up their own over-the-counter shops. These included Chan Wing-yee, Joseph La m Ch ok and Sheena Leung. We're thrilled to be partnering for TOKEN2049, a key crypto event!

Another example of a crypto project that employed this tactic is Centra Tech, a fraudulent crypto project that leveraged celebrity endorsements and event appearances to gain credibility. With its antics, it secured $32 million in funding through an ICO, claiming to offer a debit card for crypto payments. Those behind it went as far as talking about it at events, touting fake partnerships with Visa and Mastercard. The SEC charged them with fraud in 2018, and co-founder Sohrab Sharma was sentenced to eight years in prison. An even more popular example is the FTX saga. FTX, now a bankrupt exchange, used its significant political influence, which it got by sponsoring politicians, to enhance its reputation. Its form er CEO S am Bankman-Fr ied would donate millions to political campaigns in the US, including $1 million to a McConnell-aligned super PAC days before FTX’s 2022 collapse. The purpose of the spending was to keep FTX on the favorable side of regulation, but in the end, FTX was exposed for misappropriating $10 billion in customer funds, leading to Bankman-Fried’s conviction in 2023.

New processes reduce friction and simplify crypto transactions. Enhanced security and clear rules boost user confidence. This approach may widen access in underserved areas. Although Bitcoin (BTC) has long been perceived as a store of value, analysts in 2024 predicted that its next major use case could emerge in the form of payments, driven by shifting regulations and increasing infrastructure support. According to EMARKETER , crypto payment adoption was expected to grow by 82.1% over two years beginning in 2024, supported by friendlier regulations and expanding payment provider networks . Source: EMARKETER A Bitget Wallet report also highlighted security concerns as the biggest barrier to crypto payment adoption. What’s driving crypto payment adoption and what’s holding it back? We surveyed 4,599 users to uncover key trends shaping the future of PayFi Here’s the key findings from our 2025 PayFi Report! pic.twitter.com/yycmW7OcWO — Bitget Wallet (@BitgetWallet) March 25, 2025 The report, which surveyed 4,599 users, found that over 37% of respondents considered security risks the main obstacle to using cryptocurrency for payments. Other concerns included irreversible transactions and a lack of legal protection. Source: Bitget Wallet Simplifying Crypto Payments With Traditional Platforms In response to ongoing security and usability issues, some platforms have started to streamline the crypto payment process to encourage broader usage. Bakhrom Saydulloev, a product lead at payments infrastructure firm Mercuryo , told Cryptonews that crypto payments had shown consistent growth despite wider market fluctuations. “The data supports this outlook, as Mercuryo is observing steady growth in payment volumes across our ecosystem despite broader market fluctuations,” said Saydulloev. Saydulloev noted that user experience remains a major hurdle. “Many products remain unnecessarily complex, fostering friction at every step from account opening to completing transactions,” he remarked. “Beyond these issues, users simply want what they expect from any payment system: low costs, speed, and safety.” Saydulloev noted that Mercuryo had begun integrating traditional payment methods to address these issues. For example, the company partnered with Revolut Pay, a mainstream online payment platform, to make buying and selling crypto more accessible. “Revolut Pay simplifies buying crypto assets to a single click,” Saydulloev said. “The platform also has reinforced security features, including biometric technology and passcodes that secure the crypto purchasing process for users.” Crypto exchange CEX.IO has also adopted traditional methods to simplify crypto transactions. Alexander Kerya, vice president of product management at CEX.IO, said the platform recently integrated with MoneyGram to support cash-in and cash-out services for USDC. “This integration facilitates crypto cash-in and cash-out services, enabling seamless conversion of Circle’s USDC stablecoin into physical cash and vice versa,” Kerya said. Kerya added that he believes the growing collaboration between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto services is gradually blurring the lines between these two industries. Regulatory Support for Crypto Payment Adoption These platform efforts coincide with evolving regulatory frameworks that support safer adoption. Bitget Wallet’s report shows that 27% of investors are worried about the lack of legal protection. This signals the need for better safeguards and regulatory clarity around crypto payments. Saydulloev highlighted regulatory progress in the EU and UK. Frameworks such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) now allow credit institutions to issue crypto assets under their existing banking licenses. “Rather than hindering innovation, these regulations create essential trust by establishing consistent rules and protections, which are prerequisites for wider adoption,” Saydulloev commented. Coinbase has also focused on easing friction around crypto payments, particularly stablecoins. A company spokesperson noted that free USDC transfers and fiat onramps make it easier for users to send and receive crypto. Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base, also allows near-instant crypto transactions with very low fees. Statistics from CoinGate , a payment platform, show that stablecoins are becoming a preferred method for crypto payments. In 2024, stablecoins accounted for 35.5% of transactions on the platform, with USDT making up 97.2% of those, followed by USDC at 2.5% and DAI at 0.3%. Global Demand for Faster, Accessible Crypto Payments While adoption in developed regions remains gradual, crypto payments are gaining traction in emerging markets with limited banking access. Bitget Wallet’s data showed that 46% of users prefer crypto payments over fiat due to speed and efficiency. Interest was particularly strong in Africa and Southeast Asia, where 52% and 51% of respondents, respectively, expressed interest in using crypto for payments. Rich Rine, an initial contributor at Core DAO, told Cryptonews that in developing regions, crypto is more than just an alternative—it’s often the first access to financial infrastructure. “In regions with large unbanked or underbanked populations, crypto payments are a 0 to 1 leap in trust and access,” Rine said. “It’s not about replacing a legacy system; it’s about gaining access to a system in the first place.” Rine added that for adoption to grow in the US and Europe, payment solutions must compete with existing systems that offer fraud protection and chargebacks. “This likely requires clearer regulatory frameworks – especially around stablecoins – and tighter integration between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi) ,” he said. For example, he suggested that banks could offer fraud protection and chargeback services on top of stablecoin rails, helping users benefit from fast infrastructure without sacrificing security. Beyond security and infrastructure, financial incentives may also shape the future of crypto-based transactions. “This adds complexity, but also introduces the idea that payments themselves could become productive, not just functional,” he said. Building Trust and Access The drive to simplify crypto payments speaks to a deeper call for secure and inclusive financial services. Traditional banks and digital providers now work side by side to build systems that users can rely on. Their combined focus on safety and usability has the power to expand access for those left behind by older models. This collaboration opens new doors for trust and participation in financial affairs. Think about how this blend of old and new might expand opportunities for you and your community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will combining traditional banking with crypto payments alter consumer use? Integrating established banking methods with digital assets offers a smoother transaction experience. This approach combines secure, familiar processes with quicker crypto transfers, lowering hurdles for daily payments. What benefits can merchants and users expect from a streamlined crypto process? A streamlined process reduces transaction friction for both merchants and consumers. By integrating secure, known banking practices, it provides faster service and ease of use, promoting smoother digital trade. How can regulators and industry leaders work together to build trust in simplified crypto payments? Regulators and industry players must establish clear, consistent rules that merge secure traditional practices with modern digital tools. This cooperative effort fosters trust and promotes broader user confidence.

However, a new type of digital fund, yield-bearing stablecoins , is gaining traction in the industry. These tokens offer interest to investors, similar to how savings accounts in traditional banks work. JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, believe yield-bearing stablecoins could grow massively in the coming years. Currently, these stablecoins make up just 6% of the stablecoin market. Panigirtzoglou suggests they could grow to 50% if regulatory hurdles do not slow them down. Why More Investors Are Choosing Yield-Bearing Stablecoins JPMorgan analysts say more people choose yield-bearing stablecoins because they offer interest without risk. Panigirtzoglou explained that investors do not need to trade or lend money; just holding these treasury funds is enough. These stablecoins have grown fast in recent months. Since the U.S. election in November 2024, the top five treasury-backed assets have increased in value. This includes Ethena’s USDe, Sky Dollar’s USDS, BlackRock’s BUIDL, Usual Protocol’s USD0, and Ondo Finance’s USDY. Their market cap has jumped from $4 billion to over $13 billion. As traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) platform yields have dropped, more investors are turning to them. Crypto trading platforms now accept tokenized U.S. Treasurys as collateral, making earning interest while holding assets easier. Additionally, well-known crypto projects like Frax Finance are now using these stablecoins, which is pushing the trend further. The SEC’s Approval Could Open the Door for More Growth Despite their fast growth, yield-bearing stablecoins still face challenges. They are classified as securities, which creates legal issues and limits their use, especially for everyday investors. However, things might be changing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved a new yield-bearing tokens called YLDS, which is registered as a security. This could open the door for more stablecoins like it. Traditional stables, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, do not share their earnings with users because doing so would make them securities. That would bring stricter rules, making them harder to use in crypto transactions. More companies might follow this model with the SEC approving a yield-bearing stablecoin. Will Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Replace Traditional Ones? Unlike traditional stablecoins with a $220 billion market cap, these newer assets have lower liquidity and are not widely used. However, JPMorgan analysts believe these obstacles may fade as more traders and projects adopt them. As more traders and crypto projects use yield-bearing tokens, their liquidity could improve. This could make them widely used as collateral in crypto trading, part of DAO treasuries, or even a way for crypto investment funds to store idle cash.

After a quiet spell, the past week has brought renewed life to the market. Solana’s BONK posted double-digit gains with impressive volume, while Dragoin ($DDGN) captured growing interest with its interactive play-to-earn design. Investors are once again paying attention—not just to hype, but to tokens that offer real engagement and growth potential. BONK and Dragoin are showing they’re not just participating in the trend—they’re shaping it. BONK Posts Big Gains & Surges in Trading Activity BONK, the top meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, has staged a significant comeback. On March 24, 2025, the token gained 14.8% within a single day, bringing its price to $0.00002507. But even more notable was its trading volume, which hit $210 million—one of the highest totals across the entire crypto market that day. This wasn’t just a random bump in interest. BONK’s performance came on the back of new exchange listings, growing developer involvement within Solana, and a fresh wave of social media activity. Analysts also highlight recent token burn announcements and community-led efforts as key drivers. As BONK bounces back from a challenging earlier stretch this year, many now see it as a core part of Solana’s push into DeFi and NFTs. Still, BONK’s rapid movement reflects how quickly meme coins can respond to sudden buzz. A listing or tweet can change everything—but how long that energy lasts remains uncertain. That’s where Dragoin offers a more carefully structured alternative, built for durability. Dragoin Builds a Strong Foundation Around Utility & Engagement While BONK is making headlines, Dragoin ($DDGN) is steadily building a following. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, this Ethereum-based token is focusing on creating a lasting ecosystem. It combines entertainment with real incentives, setting it apart in a crowded field. At the center of Dragoin is a Telegram-based play-to-earn game. Players can hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens along the way. It’s not just for fun—it’s a system that turns participation into value. Users aren’t just buying and holding; they’re actively engaging, competing, and growing the network. Dragoin’s structure is another key to its appeal. It has a 200 billion token supply, with 50% allocated to a presale divided into 25 pricing stages. As each stage progresses, the price increases. Unsold tokens won’t linger—they’ll be permanently burned, increasing scarcity. The remaining tokens support liquidity, rewards, and development, with only 5% locked for the team under a two-year vesting schedule. That level of clarity and planning is still rare among meme projects. Dragoin’s next steps are already mapped out. In Q2 2025, it will roll out the full game, launch staking options, and expand with influencer collaborations. Q3 is set to bring listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, along with more in-game features. While the online buzz is growing fast, the plan behind it is focused on lasting growth—not quick spikes. Meme Coins Are Growing Up—And So Are Their Audiences The strong rise of both BONK and Dragoin signals that meme coins are evolving—and so are the expectations of those investing in them. The market is no longer driven only by names or memes. It’s about utility, community, and what comes next. BONK, already established and widely recognized, is showing how a meme coin can adapt and align with a broader blockchain vision. Its recent trading activity and increased exchange visibility suggest that it’s becoming more than just a cultural relic—it’s taking on a strategic role in Solana’s crypto growth. Dragoin, on the other hand, represents a fresh direction. It’s not leaning on nostalgia. It’s offering a hands-on experience, paired with a token model that encourages long-term engagement. The combination of gaming, decentralization, and deflationary mechanics is striking a chord with a new wave of users who want to do more than just hold. Together, these two projects highlight different paths to success. BONK reflects resilience and evolution. Dragoin, meanwhile, offers innovation and a new kind of interaction. Both are thriving—but each is writing its own unique story in the next chapter of meme coins.

42500579,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144062,1743116442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Major Crypto Seizure: US DoJ Targets Hamas Terrorism Financing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unveiling-crypto-seizure-doj/,"In a significant move highlighting the ongoing battle against illicit finance in the digital age, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced the seizure of approximately $200,000 in cryptocurrency. This crypto seizure targeted a digital wallet allegedly linked to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The operation underscores the increasing scrutiny on cryptocurrency’s role in funding illegal activities and the proactive measures law enforcement agencies are taking to counter it. This incident also brings to the forefront critical questions about the use of digital assets in terrorism financing and the evolving regulatory landscape. What Exactly Happened with this Crypto Seizure? According to the DoJ, the seized cryptocurrency originated from a wallet believed to be controlled by Hamas. While the immediate seizure amounted to $200,000, authorities suspect this wallet was part of a larger network responsible for laundering around $1.5 million in funds for the organization. This operation is not isolated; it’s part of a broader effort by the U.S. government to disrupt and dismantle financial networks supporting terrorist groups. The details released by the DoJ indicate a sophisticated investigation that traced the flow of funds through the blockchain to identify and ultimately seize the assets. This successful crypto seizure is a testament to the growing capabilities of law enforcement in tracking and intercepting illicit cryptocurrency transactions. Why is Hamas Crypto Usage a Concern? The use of cryptocurrency by groups like Hamas raises several red flags. Here’s why this is a significant concern: Anonymity and Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies, by nature, offer a degree of anonymity and operate outside traditional financial systems. This decentralization can be exploited to evade detection and sanctions, making it challenging for authorities to track and control financial flows. Ease of Cross-Border Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are borderless, enabling groups to receive and transfer funds internationally without relying on traditional banking infrastructure. This ease of cross-border movement complicates efforts to monitor and intercept funds intended for illicit purposes, including terrorism financing. Lower Transaction Fees: Compared to traditional banking systems, cryptocurrency transactions often involve lower fees, making them an attractive option for frequent and large-scale money movements, even for activities like terrorism financing. Potential for Fundraising: Cryptocurrencies can be used to solicit donations globally through online platforms and social media. This fundraising mechanism can be particularly effective for groups seeking to operate outside the purview of traditional financial regulations. The recent crypto seizure highlights these vulnerabilities and underscores the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to combat the misuse of digital assets for illegal activities like terrorism financing. The Role of the DOJ in Combating Terrorism Financing The Department of Justice (DOJ) plays a crucial role in the U.S. government’s efforts to combat terrorism financing. Its responsibilities encompass a wide range of activities, including: Area Description Investigation and Prosecution The DoJ investigates and prosecutes individuals and entities involved in financing terrorism. This includes tracing financial flows, identifying facilitators, and bringing legal action against those who provide material support to terrorist organizations. Asset Forfeiture As demonstrated by this crypto seizure, the DoJ utilizes asset forfeiture laws to seize and confiscate assets derived from or used to facilitate terrorism financing. This disrupts the financial resources available to terrorist groups and prevents them from using these funds for further illicit activities. International Cooperation The DoJ works closely with international partners to share information, coordinate investigations, and extradite individuals involved in terrorism financing. This global collaboration is essential to address the transnational nature of terrorist financing networks. Policy and Strategy Development The DoJ contributes to the development of national policies and strategies to counter terrorism financing. This includes working with other government agencies and international bodies to enhance legal frameworks and improve enforcement mechanisms. The successful crypto seizure operation against Hamas is a clear example of the DOJ’s proactive approach and effectiveness in disrupting terrorist financing networks. How Does Crypto Laundering Work and How is it Being Addressed? Crypto laundering, the process of concealing the origin of cryptocurrency obtained illegally, is a growing concern for law enforcement agencies worldwide. The methods employed by criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but so are the tools and techniques to counter them. Here’s a breakdown of how crypto laundering works and the measures being taken to address it: Common Crypto Laundering Techniques: Tumblers and Mixers: These services obscure the transaction history by mixing various cryptocurrency transactions together, making it harder to trace the original source of funds. Privacy Coins: Cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash offer enhanced privacy features, making transactions more difficult to trace compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Layered Transactions: Launderers may use multiple wallets and exchanges, moving funds through a complex web of transactions to obfuscate the money trail. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): DEXs often have less stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements compared to centralized exchanges, providing avenues for laundering funds with reduced scrutiny. Cross-Chain Swaps: Converting cryptocurrencies across different blockchains can also be used to complicate tracing efforts. Addressing Crypto Laundering: Enhanced Regulations: Governments and regulatory bodies are implementing stricter regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, including robust KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. Blockchain Analytics Tools: Sophisticated blockchain analytics tools are being developed and utilized by law enforcement and financial institutions to trace cryptocurrency transactions, identify suspicious patterns, and uncover laundering schemes. International Collaboration: Global cooperation among law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies is crucial for sharing information, coordinating investigations, and establishing international standards to combat crypto laundering. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies and the cryptocurrency industry is essential to develop effective solutions and best practices for preventing and detecting crypto laundering. The seizure of funds from the Hamas wallet underscores the effectiveness of these countermeasures and the ongoing efforts to refine and improve them. The fight against crypto laundering is a continuous process that requires constant adaptation and innovation. What are the Broader Implications of this Hamas Crypto Case? This particular crypto seizure case has broader implications for the cryptocurrency world and beyond: Legitimacy of Crypto Under Scrutiny: Incidents like this, where cryptocurrency is linked to terrorism financing, can fuel skepticism about the legitimacy of digital assets and strengthen calls for stricter regulation. It is crucial for the crypto industry to proactively address these concerns and demonstrate its commitment to compliance and responsible use. Increased Regulatory Pressure: Expect to see increased regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency industry globally. Governments will likely push for more stringent KYC/AML requirements, enhanced transaction monitoring, and greater oversight of crypto exchanges and service providers to prevent illicit activities. Advancements in Crypto Tracing Technology: The success of this crypto seizure will likely spur further investment and innovation in blockchain analytics and crypto tracing technologies. The ability to effectively track and intercept illicit cryptocurrency transactions is becoming increasingly vital for law enforcement and national security. Heightened Awareness of Terrorism Financing Risks: This case serves as a stark reminder of the evolving tactics used by terrorist organizations to finance their operations. It highlights the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation in strategies to counter terrorism financing, particularly in the digital realm. Actionable Insights: What Can Be Learned? For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, this event provides several actionable insights: Prioritize Security and Compliance: For cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, robust security measures and strict adherence to KYC/AML regulations are paramount. Proactive compliance can help prevent the misuse of platforms for illicit activities and build trust with regulators and users. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is constantly evolving. Individuals and businesses need to stay informed about new regulations and adapt their practices accordingly to remain compliant. Support Responsible Crypto Use: The cryptocurrency community has a responsibility to promote the responsible use of digital assets and actively combat illicit activities. This includes supporting initiatives that enhance transparency, improve security, and foster collaboration with law enforcement. Understand the Risks: Users of cryptocurrency should be aware of the potential risks associated with illicit activities and take precautions to protect themselves from scams and involvement in illegal transactions. Conclusion: A Warning Shot for Illicit Crypto Use The U.S. DoJ’s crypto seizure from a Hamas-linked wallet is more than just a confiscation of funds; it’s a powerful statement. It demonstrates the resolve and increasing capability of law enforcement to track and disrupt illicit financial activities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This operation serves as a clear warning to those who seek to exploit digital assets for illegal purposes, including terrorism financing and crypto laundering. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so too will the scrutiny and efforts to ensure its responsible and legitimate use. The future of cryptocurrency hinges on its ability to operate within a framework of transparency, security, and compliance, and this crypto seizure is a significant step in that direction.

Recently, pseudonymous Bitcoin market analyst Plan B ignited a fresh wave of speculation by suggesting that Bitcoin is not just valuable, but profoundly undervalued when stacked against traditional titans like gold and real estate. For those navigating the crypto landscape, Plan B’s insights offer a compelling narrative, hinting at a potentially significant upside for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Let’s dive deep into this intriguing analysis and unpack what it means for the future of digital gold. Is Bitcoin Really Undervalued? Plan B Thinks So Plan B, a well-known figure in the crypto sphere for his stock-to-flow (S2F) model, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his perspective on Bitcoin’s current market position. His core argument is simple yet powerful: Bitcoin’s market capitalization and scarcity metrics point towards a substantial undervaluation relative to gold and real estate. But what exactly does this mean, and how does he arrive at this conclusion? According to Plan B’s analysis, the numbers speak volumes: Bitcoin’s Market Cap: Currently hovering around $2 trillion. Gold’s Market Cap: A staggering $20 trillion. This ten-fold difference in market capitalization is the first red flag for Plan B. He argues that considering Bitcoin’s growing adoption, technological advancements, and its inherent scarcity, this valuation gap is simply too wide. But the comparison doesn’t stop at market cap. Plan B delves into another crucial metric: scarcity. Scarcity Showdown: Bitcoin vs. Gold Scarcity is a fundamental principle driving value in both traditional commodities like gold and digital assets like Bitcoin. Plan B highlights the concept of “stock-to-flow” ratio to illustrate this point. Stock-to-flow essentially measures the relationship between the existing supply of an asset (stock) and the rate at which new supply is produced (flow). A higher stock-to-flow ratio generally indicates greater scarcity and, theoretically, greater value retention over time. Let’s break down the stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin and gold as presented by Plan B: Bitcoin’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Approximately 120 years. Gold’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Around 60 years. Intriguingly, Bitcoin boasts a stock-to-flow ratio twice that of gold. This implies that Bitcoin is inherently scarcer than gold, at least based on this metric. Plan B posits that this superior scarcity should logically translate to a higher, or at least comparable, valuation. The fact that Bitcoin’s market cap is only a fraction of gold’s, despite its greater scarcity, further strengthens his argument for Bitcoin being undervalued . Real Estate Enters the Valuation Equation While gold is a traditional safe-haven asset often compared to Bitcoin, Plan B also brings real estate into the conversation. The global real estate market dwarfs both gold and Bitcoin in terms of total value. Estimates vary, but the global real estate market is often cited as being several times larger than the gold market, easily exceeding $200 trillion. Why include real estate in this comparison? Plan B’s rationale likely stems from the fact that real estate, like gold, is considered a store of value and a hedge against inflation. However, unlike Bitcoin, real estate is not inherently scarce and is significantly less divisible and portable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers digital scarcity, ease of transfer, and global accessibility. Considering the vastness of the real estate market, Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap appears even smaller in perspective. While real estate serves different purposes and has unique utility, the comparison highlights the immense potential upside if Bitcoin continues to gain traction as a global store of value. What Makes Bitcoin Potentially Undervalued? Beyond market cap and stock-to-flow, several factors contribute to the narrative of Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation: Growing Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even nation-states are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This institutional influx brings significant capital and validation to the Bitcoin market. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. This hard cap ensures digital scarcity, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust blockchain technology offer security and censorship resistance, appealing to individuals and entities seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. Network Effects: As more people adopt and use Bitcoin, its network effect strengthens, further enhancing its value and utility. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments like the Lightning Network and Taproot upgrades are improving Bitcoin’s scalability, privacy, and functionality. These factors collectively paint a picture of a maturing asset with strong fundamentals and growing adoption. If Plan B’s analysis is accurate, and Bitcoin is indeed undervalued , then the current price levels could represent a significant buying opportunity for long-term investors. Challenges and Counterarguments to Bitcoin’s Undervaluation While Plan B’s perspective is compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the counterarguments and challenges to the idea that Bitcoin is fundamentally undervalued: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Price swings can be dramatic and unpredictable, deterring some investors and raising concerns about its stability as a store of value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Unfavorable regulations in major economies could negatively impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Competition from Other Cryptocurrencies: The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with new projects and technologies emerging. Bitcoin faces competition from other cryptocurrencies that may offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, or different functionalities. Energy Consumption Concerns: Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is energy-intensive, raising environmental concerns and attracting criticism. While solutions like the Lightning Network and layer-2 scaling aim to address this, it remains a valid concern for some. Market Sentiment and Speculation: Cryptocurrency markets are heavily influenced by market sentiment and speculation. Price movements can be driven by hype and fear, rather than solely by fundamental value. These challenges highlight the inherent risks associated with investing in Bitcoin and underscore the importance of conducting thorough research and understanding the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Undervalued Bitcoin Narrative So, what are the actionable takeaways from Plan B’s analysis and the broader discussion about Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Plan B’s analysis is a valuable perspective, but it’s crucial to conduct your own independent research. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, economics, and market dynamics. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin may present a compelling investment opportunity, diversification is key to managing risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin alongside other asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Its volatility means short-term price fluctuations are inevitable. Focus on the long-term potential and avoid being swayed by short-term market noise. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and it’s essential to manage your risk appropriately. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Undervalued Potential – A Smart Investment? Plan B’s assertion that Bitcoin is undervalued compared to gold and real estate offers a thought-provoking perspective on the current cryptocurrency landscape. By highlighting the market cap disparity and superior stock-to-flow ratio, he presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s untapped potential. While challenges and risks remain, the fundamental arguments for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition – scarcity, decentralization, growing adoption – are undeniable. Whether Bitcoin will ultimately reach the market capitalization levels of gold or real estate remains to be seen, but Plan B’s analysis certainly provides a strong incentive for investors to take a closer look and consider the smart investment opportunity that Bitcoin might represent.

Over the past 30 days, traders have deployed nearly $400 million in short-leveraged positions, preventing XRP from breaking key resistance levels. How will XRP price react in April 2025? Ripple (XRP) Stagnates at $2.35 as Traders Remain Reluctant to Sell Ripple (XRP) has delivered notable gains over the past week, largely driven by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision to drop charges against Ripple. Many market participants expected a sharp correction following the 10% rally on Monday, assuming large investors would trigger a “sell-the-news” event. However, sustained bullish sentiment, coupled with fresh volatility from Trump’s 25% auto tariff announcement, has helped XRP maintain stability. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis | March 27 | Source: Coinmarketcap Market data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Ripple price briefly dipped to $2.30 before rebounding to $2.35 at press time. This intraday recovery suggests strong buying support at current levels. $244 Million XRP Short Leverage Cluster Emerges at $2.60 as Bears Look to Avert $3 Breakout While spot market sentiment has remained optimistic, XRP derivatives data signal stiff resistance clusters that could impede further price gains. Coinglass liquidation data highlights a notable discrepancy between short and long leverage positions. Over the past 30 days, bears have placed $404 million in short-leveraged positions—30% more than the $283 million in active long positions. The most significant concentration of these short positions, totalling $244 million, is clustered around the $2.60 level. Ripple (XRP) 30-day Liquidation Map, March 27 | Coinglass This high volume of short positions at $2.60 may explain why XRP has struggled to breach this resistance level, despite strong fundamental catalysts such as the SEC dropping its case against Ripple. Whenever XRP price approaches $2.60, an influx of sell orders from leveraged short positions forces a retracement, effectively capping bullish momentum. Until short positions are liquidated or bulls muster enough demand to absorb selling pressure, XRP may continue to face strong resistance at $2.60, delaying a potential breakout toward $3. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Struggle as XRP Faces Key Resistance at $2.40, Eyes $2.00 Support XRP price remains under pressure, trading at $2.35, as it struggles to reclaim key resistance levels. The daily chart presents mixed signals, with the 50-day SMA at $2.52 acting as a key barrier to the upside, while support at $2.00 remains a critical level for bulls to defend. The declining MACD histogram suggests waning bullish momentum, as the MACD line flattens near the zero mark. This signals that buying pressure is fading, leaving room for potential downside movement. XRP Price Forecast The Parabolic SAR dots above the current price indicate a bearish trend, reinforcing the likelihood of further selling pressure. Additionally, declining volume confirms the lack of strong bullish conviction. However, if XRP reclaims $2.40 and closes above the 50-day SMA, it could spark renewed bullish momentum, targeting $2.60. Failure to hold above $2.30 could expose XRP to further declines, with bears eyeing the $2.00 psychological level as the next support. A decisive move below $2.00 would confirm a bearish breakdown, opening the door for further losses toward $1.76.

The latest report, titled “Interest Rates, the S&P 500, and Bitcoin: Lessons from the Past and Expectations in 2025,” examines historical market reactions to the Fed’s policy changes and offers important insights for investors navigating the current economic environment. Dot-Com Bubble (2000-2002): Fed rate hikes contributed to the bursting of the tech bubble, causing the S&P 500 to fall by nearly 50% as overvalued companies collapsed. Subprime Crisis (2007-2009): The S&P 500 fell nearly 57% as the Fed raised interest rates to combat inflation and excessive credit, triggering a global financial crisis. COVID-19 Crash and Recovery (2020): The Fed’s emergency rate cuts and liquidity injections initially led to a sharp 35% decline in the S&P 500, followed by a rapid recovery. Bitcoin has been volatile, but has ultimately benefited from the low-interest environment, strengthening its appeal as an alternative asset. Current Cycle (2022-2025): Divergence in Market Behavior Since 2022, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates from near-zero to 5.5% to counter post-pandemic inflation. Unlike previous crises, the S&P 500 has remained resilient, reaching new highs in 2024-2025. Alphractal attributes this to the following reasons: Lower corporate leverage compared to 2008. Strong performance from AI and technology giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft. Expectations of gradual interest rate cuts are fueling investor optimism. However, the divergence between interest rates and stock market performance is a major concern, according to the analyst firm. Historically, such a breakout has been preceded by high volatility. Bitcoin's historical performance reveals a strong correlation with liquidity conditions: 2010-2021 (Low Interest Rate Era): Bitcoin rose from mere cents to $69,000 in 2021. 2022 Rate Hikes: BTC experienced a sharp correction and dropped to around $16,000. 2024-2025 Stabilization: Bitcoin has regained strength as interest rates have fallen slightly, consolidating its role as a hedge against expansionary monetary policy and inflation. What Happens to Bitcoin If the Fed Cuts Interest Rates? According to Alphractal, the impact of future rate cuts will depend on their nature: Emergency Cuts (Symptom of Crisis): If the Fed is forced to cut rates due to a major economic shock (similar to 2008 or 2020), initial market reactions may be bearish, with both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin experiencing sharp declines. Preemptive Cuts (Soft Landing): Gradual interest rate cuts, as seen in 1995-1996 and 2019, can support market growth, benefiting both stocks and digital assets. Market Scenarios 2025: Alphractal's Forecasts Alphractal outlines three possible scenarios for 2025: Gradual Rate Cuts: If the Fed cuts interest rates in a controlled manner without triggering a recession, the S&P 500 could maintain its upward momentum and Bitcoin could benefit from increased liquidity. External Shock: A new crisis such as geopolitical instability, banking collapse or another pandemic could cause a sharp decline in the market despite interest rate cuts. Persistently High Interest Rates: If inflation remains stubborn and the Fed maintains or raises interest rates, a severe market correction similar to 2000 or 2008 could ensue. *This is not investment advice.

The fourth-quarter GDP numbers “demonstrate that the economy is heading into this year with great momentum and profitability and is resilient to some level of policy uncertainty,” Wells Fargo economists Shannon Grein and Tim Quinlan said. But they fretted over how businesses would respond if trade conditions changed and uncertainty over where the economy is headed. That level of profitability is far above historical averages, which suggests that companies may be able to swallow persistent cost increases rather than pass them on to consumers. That could help keep inflation under control even as trade policies change. Consumer spending slows as businesses stock up Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the economy, increased at a revised 4% pace in the fourth quarter, a bit below prior estimates. And businesses raced to import goods ahead of anticipated tariffs, which helped fuel a jump in imports. The trade gap stayed elevated in February but shrank slightly from a record in January. Some economists caution that this surge of imports will lead to a slowdown in GDP growth in early 2025. Another key economic measure, gross domestic income (GDI), rose 4.5% in the fourth quarter from 1.4% in the third quarter. While GDP measures how much people and businesses spend on goods and services, GDI measures the income earned and the costs involved in producing them. Those two measures grew 3.5% on average last quarter, the fastest pace in a year. A report on Thursday showed that new unemployment claims held steady at 224,000 last week, meaning that the number of people applying for jobless benefits changed a bit. Uncertain trade policies shape 2025 economic outlook Economic growth was robust in the fourth quarter of 2024 but is expected to slow in the months ahead. Most economists are cautious about the future, pointing to shifting trade policies and business uncertainty. Even two of the most powerful investment banks in the world, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have already cut back their forecasts, citing the uncertain global trade environment as a potential drag on economic growth. In an age of surging tariffs, new trade deals, and the potential creation of additional policies, businesses are increasingly reluctant to invest and expand as they work through the unclear swamps of an uncertain market environment. These concerns have led to an update of the Federal Reserveʼs economic outlook and a recognition of the risks to growth. Some economists now expect G.D.P. to reduce in the first three months of 2025 as businesses and consumers dial back spending in the face of an uncertain economic outlook. A rise in imports in the early months of the year, partly propelled by companies stockpiling goods ahead of new tariffs, could also depress growth. If companies cut back on production or lower spending because of higher costs, that could slash more water on economic activity.

42501265,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144063,1743117638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Lightning-Fast Crypto Trading: Jupiter DEX Unleashes Signless Transactions on Solana,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jupiter-dex-signless-solana/,"Are you tired of slow crypto transactions and hefty fees slowing down your trading game? In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), every second counts, and every penny saved is a penny earned. For Solana enthusiasts and high-frequency traders, the wait for a game-changing solution is finally over! Jupiter, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, has just dropped a bombshell update that promises to redefine trading speed and efficiency. Get ready to experience the future of DeFi trading with Jupiter DEX ‘s revolutionary new feature: Quick Accounts. What are Solana Signless Transactions and Why Should You Care? Imagine executing trades on the Solana blockchain without the constant need to manually sign each transaction with your wallet. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, dream no more! Solana signless transactions are now a reality thanks to Jupiter’s innovative Quick Accounts. This groundbreaking feature leverages embedded wallets to enable a smoother, faster, and significantly cheaper trading experience. But what exactly are signless transactions, and why are they such a big deal? In traditional blockchain transactions, every action, whether it’s swapping tokens, providing liquidity, or interacting with a smart contract, requires a digital signature from your wallet. This process, while crucial for security, can introduce delays and add to transaction costs. Signless transactions, on the other hand, streamline this process by utilizing embedded wallets that handle transaction signing behind the scenes, offering a near-instantaneous trading experience. Think of it as autopilot for your crypto trades! Here’s a simple breakdown: Traditional Transactions: User initiates transaction -> Wallet prompts for signature -> User signs -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Signless Transactions (with Jupiter Quick Accounts): User initiates transaction -> Embedded wallet signs automatically -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Unpacking Jupiter’s Embedded Wallets and Quick Accounts At the heart of this innovation are embedded wallets . Jupiter’s Quick Accounts are essentially smart contract-based wallets that are seamlessly integrated into the Jupiter DEX platform. These wallets are designed to manage transaction signing automatically, eliminating the need for manual wallet interactions for every trade. This integration is not just about speed; it’s about creating a more user-friendly and efficient trading environment, especially crucial for those engaged in rapid-fire trading strategies. Let’s delve deeper into the key aspects of Jupiter Quick Accounts: Speed Boost: By automating the signing process, Quick Accounts drastically reduce transaction times. This is a game-changer for traders who need to react quickly to market fluctuations. Reduced Fees: Faster transactions often translate to lower gas fees on the Solana network, making trading more cost-effective, particularly for high-volume traders. Lower DeFi transaction fees mean more profit in your pocket. Enhanced User Experience: Say goodbye to constant wallet pop-ups and signature requests. Quick Accounts offer a streamlined, almost centralized exchange-like trading experience within the decentralized realm. Security Considerations: While signless transactions offer convenience, security remains paramount. Jupiter has implemented robust security measures for Quick Accounts, but users should always exercise caution and understand the security implications of using embedded wallets. Always do your own research (DYOR) and manage your risk accordingly. The Tremendous Benefits of Crypto Trading Speed for Solana Users Why is crypto trading speed so critical, especially on a blockchain like Solana, known for its high throughput? The answer lies in the nature of crypto markets – they are volatile, dynamic, and move at lightning speed. Faster transaction execution can mean the difference between a profitable trade and a missed opportunity. For Solana users, Jupiter’s Quick Accounts unlock a new level of trading agility. Consider these advantages: Benefit Description Impact on Traders Faster Order Execution Signless transactions minimize delays in processing trades. Capture fleeting market opportunities, execute trades at desired prices more consistently. Reduced Slippage Quicker trades mean less time for price to move against you before your order is filled. Minimize losses due to unfavorable price changes during transaction processing. Improved Arbitrage Opportunities Speed is paramount in arbitrage trading. Signless transactions provide the edge needed to capitalize on price differences across exchanges. Unlock more arbitrage opportunities and increase profitability from arbitrage strategies. Better Performance for Algorithmic Trading Algorithmic trading bots rely on speed and efficiency. Quick Accounts enhance the performance of automated trading strategies on Jupiter. Optimize algorithmic trading strategies for maximum efficiency and profitability. Addressing Potential Challenges and Security Aspects While the advantages are clear, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges. Any new technology comes with learning curves and considerations. For embedded wallets and signless transactions, users should be mindful of: Security Practices: Understanding the security framework of embedded wallets is crucial. Users need to trust the platform and ensure they are following best practices for account security. Smart Contract Risks: Quick Accounts rely on smart contracts. While audited, smart contracts are not immune to vulnerabilities. Users should be aware of smart contract risks associated with DeFi platforms. Custodial Aspects: While presented as non-custodial in the sense that you retain control over your funds within the smart contract, embedded wallets introduce a different custodial model compared to traditional self-custody. Understanding this nuance is key. Platform Dependency: Reliance on Jupiter’s infrastructure is inherent when using Quick Accounts. Users should consider the platform’s reliability and reputation. Jupiter has emphasized security in the development of Quick Accounts. However, as with any DeFi innovation, users are encouraged to exercise caution, educate themselves thoroughly, and only use services they fully understand and trust. Actionable Insights: Getting Started with Jupiter Quick Accounts Ready to dive into the world of signless transactions on Jupiter? Here’s a quick guide to get you started: Visit Jupiter DEX: Head over to the Jupiter DEX platform . Connect Your Wallet: Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to the platform. Explore Quick Accounts: Look for the Quick Accounts feature within the Jupiter interface (likely under account settings or trading preferences). Enable Quick Accounts: Follow the prompts to set up and enable Quick Accounts. This might involve creating a new embedded wallet or linking an existing one. Start Trading: Once enabled, you can start experiencing the speed and efficiency of signless transactions. Monitor and Manage: Keep an eye on your Quick Accounts and transactions. Familiarize yourself with the platform’s security features and best practices. Jupiter’s Quick Accounts represent a significant leap forward in making DeFi trading more accessible and efficient. By embracing Solana signless transactions and embedded wallets, Jupiter is not just enhancing its platform; it’s contributing to the evolution of the entire DeFi ecosystem. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of DeFi Trading Jupiter’s introduction of Quick Accounts is more than just an update; it’s a bold step towards the future of DeFi trading. By tackling the challenges of transaction speed and fees head-on, Jupiter is paving the way for a more seamless, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized trading experience. The era of lightning-fast crypto trading on Solana is here, and Jupiter DEX is leading the charge.

Bitcoin Faces Pressure After Massive Long Position Wipeout,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/are-the-bulls-still-in-control-bitcoin-faces-pressure-after-massive-long-position-wipeout/,"Bitcoin continues to show signs of price consolidation, with its value hovering just below the $87,000 mark. As of today, BTC is trading at approximately $86,990, reflecting a 0.8% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the slight dip, the broader picture shows that Bitcoin has stabilized above $85,000 for several consecutive sessions, signaling a pause in the strong upward or downward momentum observed in previous weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $86K as On-Chain Data Points to ‘Bullish Shift’ Long Liquidation Indication For The Market While volatility appears subdued, market dynamics remain active behind the scenes. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s latest market structure, highlighting a key development: the liquidation of $359.7 million worth of long positions. This event has drawn attention to potential shifts in sentiment and important technical levels that may act as support or resistance in the short term. According to Taha, a long liquidation occurs when traders holding leveraged long positions are forced to close their trades after the price drops below their margin thresholds. When this happens at scale, as seen recently, it reflects a sudden change in sentiment and often forces short-term sell-offs. However, Taha points out that such events can also set the stage for a potential market rebound, as many overleveraged positions are cleared, giving space for new demand to emerge. Liquidation event of $359.7M in long positions “If BTC holds above the short-term realized price, it suggests strength in demand. A breakdown below these levels might indicate a potential reversal or correction.” – By Amr Taha Full post ⤵️https://t.co/SW9e16kofW pic.twitter.com/0YR9rfreGa — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Bitcoin UTXO Metrics Paint a Mixed Picture Complementing this observation is Bitcoin’s realized price distribution by UTXO age bands. Taha notes that Bitcoin’s current market price remains above the realized price for UTXOs aged 1 day to 1 week, indicating that recent buyers are holding unrealized profits. Meanwhile, UTXOs in the 1-week to 1-month range have their realized price near $84,740—a level that could act as technical support if Bitcoin dips in the near term. This confluence of short-term holder profitability and support near $84K may serve as an important signal. If Bitcoin maintains its position above these realized price zones, it suggests continued strength from recent buyers. However, if the price begins to fall below these thresholds, it could point to increased selling pressure or a broader correction phase.

As key breakout levels loom, market watchers are buzzing with curiosity. Will these assets surge to new heights, or falter under pressure? Discover the exciting potential and hidden opportunities within the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency. Worldcoin: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Pressure The past month Worldcoin experienced a 7.39% decline paired with a 9.10% weekly rebound, indicating volatile price swings. Over the past six months, the coin has dropped sharply by 53.76%, reflecting a significant bearish trend amid persistent downward pressure. The price actions reveal a market that struggled to maintain momentum over a longer cycle while showing glimpses of recovery in the short run. These changes outline a history marked by rapid declines along with sporadic rallies that indicate the coin’s reactive nature in bearish market conditions. The coin currently trades between $0.78 and $1.62, with a key resistance level set at $2.14 and strong support around $0.46. Technical measures suggest balanced activity between bulls and bears, with no decisive trend direction. Traders could consider buying near support and taking profits as resistance nears, keeping a close eye on market fluctuations. GALA Price Trends and Key Trading Levels GALA showed a mild recovery over the past month, gaining approximately 5% with a monthly increase around 5.5%. However, it has experienced a six-month decline of nearly 21%, indicating ongoing downward pressure despite recent short-term strength. The price action has fluctuated, with various upswings from a low range. Overall, sentiment among traders appears cautious as they assess the market's direction. Current price is between $0.0129 and $0.0293, with resistance around $0.0392 and support at $0.0065. Bulls are currently testing the resistance levels while bears exert pressure, leading to a lack of a clear trend. Traders might consider entering positions near support and monitoring for a breakout above resistance, which could signal potential upward momentum. Conclusion WLD and GALA are nearing critical breakout points. Such levels suggest a potential for upward movement. If the breakout is confirmed, investors might see significant gains. Monitoring these levels closely will be essential to capitalize on the possible price surge. While the immediate future looks promising, only time will reveal if these cryptocurrencies can maintain their momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Hyperliquid has just announced a significant expansion to its offerings. Get ready to dive into the world of ETH trading as deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading for Ether (ETH) are now officially live on Hyperliquid. This development marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the wider crypto community, opening up new avenues for traders and investors alike. Let’s explore what this exciting launch means for you. Why is ETH Trading on Hyperliquid a Game Changer? The introduction of ETH trading on Hyperliquid isn’t just another listing; it’s a strategic move that brings numerous benefits to users. Hyperliquid has quickly gained attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space for its innovative approach and robust infrastructure. Adding ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, to its trading roster significantly enhances the platform’s appeal and utility. But what exactly makes this launch so impactful? Expanded Trading Opportunities: With ETH trading now available, Hyperliquid users have access to a wider range of trading pairs and opportunities. Ethereum is a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, and its availability on Hyperliquid provides traders with more flexibility and portfolio diversification options. Enhanced Liquidity: Listing ETH typically attracts more users and trading volume, leading to increased liquidity on the platform. Higher liquidity translates to tighter spreads, faster order execution, and reduced slippage, all of which are crucial for efficient crypto spot trading . Platform Growth: The addition of ETH can be seen as a sign of Hyperliquid’s growth and maturity. It demonstrates the platform’s commitment to expanding its offerings and becoming a comprehensive hub for decentralized trading. Access to DeFi Ecosystem: Ethereum is the backbone of a vast DeFi ecosystem. By facilitating Ethereum trading , Hyperliquid is further integrating itself into this ecosystem, potentially unlocking future integrations and opportunities for its users. Navigating the World of Decentralized Exchange ETH Trading on Hyperliquid For those new to decentralized exchanges or Hyperliquid itself, understanding the basics is essential before diving into ETH trading . Decentralized exchanges differ significantly from centralized exchanges in their operational model and ethos. Here’s a quick rundown: Feature Decentralized Exchange (DEX) – Hyperliquid Centralized Exchange (CEX) Custody of Funds Users retain control of their private keys and funds. Users deposit funds, and the exchange controls custody. Transparency Transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, offering high transparency. Transactions are often less transparent, with order books and execution details sometimes opaque. Security Relies on smart contracts and blockchain security; reduces single point of failure risks. Vulnerable to centralized points of failure and hacking of exchange infrastructure. Regulation Operates with less regulatory oversight, though this landscape is evolving. Subject to stricter regulatory compliance and KYC/AML procedures. Accessibility Potentially more accessible globally, without stringent KYC in some cases. May have geographical restrictions and stricter onboarding processes. Hyperliquid, as a decentralized exchange , embodies these DEX principles, offering users a platform for crypto spot trading where they maintain control over their assets. The launch of ETH trading further enriches this ecosystem. Unlocking the Potential of Crypto Spot Trading with ETH on Hyperliquid Crypto spot trading refers to the immediate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for instant delivery. Unlike futures or margin trading, spot trading involves direct ownership of the asset. With ETH trading now live on Hyperliquid, users can engage in spot trading with Ethereum, leveraging the platform’s decentralized nature and unique features. What are some key benefits of engaging in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid? Direct Ownership: When you engage in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid, you directly own the ETH you purchase. This ownership is recorded on the blockchain, giving you full control over your assets. Simplicity: Spot trading is generally simpler to understand compared to more complex trading instruments like derivatives. It’s a straightforward way to buy or sell ETH based on your market analysis and strategy. Decentralized Security: Trading ETH on a decentralized exchange like Hyperliquid enhances security by minimizing counterparty risk. Your funds are not held by a central entity, reducing the risk of exchange hacks or failures. Transparency and Control: DEXs like Hyperliquid offer greater transparency in trading operations. You can often verify transactions on the blockchain, and you retain control over your private keys, empowering you in your trading journey. Navigating Challenges in ETH Trading on a Decentralized Exchange While decentralized exchange ETH trading on platforms like Hyperliquid offers numerous advantages, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Complexity for Beginners: DEXs can sometimes have a steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with concepts like wallet management, gas fees, and blockchain interactions. However, platforms are continually working on improving user experience. Gas Fees: Transactions on Ethereum and many DEXs involve gas fees, which can fluctuate and sometimes be high, especially during periods of network congestion. Understanding and managing gas fees is crucial for cost-effective ETH trading . Smart Contract Risks: While smart contracts enhance security, they are not immune to vulnerabilities. It’s essential to use reputable and audited DEX platforms like Hyperliquid, which prioritize security and smart contract integrity. Liquidity Fragmentation: While Hyperliquid aims to provide robust liquidity, liquidity can sometimes be fragmented across different DEXs compared to centralized exchanges. It’s important to monitor liquidity when engaging in larger trades. Actionable Insights for Getting Started with ETH Trading on Hyperliquid Ready to jump into ETH trading on Hyperliquid? Here are some actionable insights to get you started on the right foot: Set up your Wallet: Ensure you have a compatible Web3 wallet like MetaMask or WalletConnect. Connect your wallet to the Hyperliquid platform. Fund your Account: Deposit ETH or other supported cryptocurrencies into your Hyperliquid account through your connected wallet. Remember to factor in gas fees for transactions. Explore the Platform: Familiarize yourself with the Hyperliquid trading interface. Understand how to navigate the order book, charts, and trading tools. Start Small: If you’re new to DEX trading or Hyperliquid, begin with smaller trades to get comfortable with the platform and processes. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market trends, Hyperliquid platform updates, and security best practices in the DeFi space. Utilize Resources: Hyperliquid likely offers documentation, tutorials, or community support channels. Make use of these resources to enhance your understanding and trading experience.

Elise Stefanik’s nomination as US ambassador to the UN has greatly impacted President Donald Trump’s choice of Cabinet members. Her confirmation had been postponed because of concerns about the narrow House margins for Republicans. Trump confirmed the ruling in a post on Truth Social, saying that they had to keep all of the Republican seats in Congress. GOP scraps Stefanik’s UN nomination to preserve House majority Stefanik was nominated shortly after Trump was reelected in November to represent the United States at the global organization. Although her nomination advanced out of committee in late January, and she was regarded as one of the least controversial Cabinet choices, the House Republicans’ razor-thin majority kept her eventual confirmation in a state of purgatory for the past few months. Stefanik’s nomination appeared to make it to the Senate floor recently, especially since Florida had two U.S. House special elections in districts that Trump won easily in 2024. However, concerns about maintaining the Republican majority ultimately led to the decision to withdraw her from consideration. “We must be unified to accomplish our mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts. As one of my biggest allies, I have asked Elise to remain in Congress,” the president said. He, however, did not specify who he would propose to take her place. On the other hand, Stefanik’s office did not immediately answer a request for comment. Keeping Stefanik in the House would have provided Republicans, who control 218 seats, more flexibility in passing legislation in an increasingly divided Congress. The Democratic caucus holds 213 seats. The GOP also took notice after Democrats won an unexpected victory in a Pennsylvania state Senate special election, flipping a seat in a Republican-leaning district. Stefanik is the fourth Trump administration nominee who did not make it through the confirmation process. Former U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz was withdrawn from consideration for the position of attorney general, Chad Chronister was removed from consideration for the position of Drug Enforcement Administration, and Dr David Weldon, a former congressman from Florida, was removed from consideration for the position of CDR. Trump withdraws Chad Chronister’s DEA nomination amid conservative backlash Trump’s selection for DEA chief, Chad Chronister, also faced confirmation troubles. A couple of months ago, Trump abruptly resigned the sheriff from a Senate confirmation position and removed his name from the list of candidates for the job. Consequently, Chronister shared an X post stating that he had turned down the offer, calling it the honour of a lifetime. Without going into further detail, Chronister wrote, “Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I have concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.” Trump explained on his social media account, Truth Social, that Chronister resigned suddenly because he did not agree with what the sheriff had told his pastors and other supporters. Some conservatives criticized Chronister for his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic and for claiming that his office was not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Deep altcoin dips could spark a reevaluation of risk, prompting a realignment of strategies. Investors might soon favor assets with stable fundamentals and robust network support. The top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization lost a combined $659 billion between January and March 2025, according to a Thursday report by CryptoQuant . Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) took the hardest hits during the downturn, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) showed more stable performance. XRP, which saw a surge earlier in the cycle, failed to maintain its gains. CryptoQuant: BTC and BNB Withstand Market Pressure CryptoQuant’s analysis showed that BTC and BNB weathered the market drop better than their peers. Each asset declined by around 20% from its most recent all-time high, marking a milder correction compared to the rest of the top five. BNB’s stability is particularly notable, as it has maintained a consistently shallow drawdown range throughout the observed period. This resilience is partly driven by practical utility across the Binance ecosystem, all of which require users to actively hold BNB. ETH and SOL… pic.twitter.com/9d6CagU2jY — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Their relative strength stood in contrast to the sharp pullbacks seen in Ethereum and Solana, both of which saw more severe losses. XRP, despite a market cap rally following the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, also slipped behind in recent weeks. ETH/BTC Ratio Fell 72% Since September 2022, CryptoQuant Data Shows Another key metric highlighted in the report is Ethereum’s falling value relative to Bitcoin. Since September 2022, the ETH/BTC ratio has dropped by 72%, reaching its lowest level since January 2020. Historically, such dips have sometimes preceded a reversal, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure against Bitcoin. Mixed Signals from XRP Performance XRP experienced a sharp rise in market capitalization following regulatory optimism in late 2024. Its valuation jumped from $30 billion in early November to $141 billion by March 2025. This growth was supported by increased activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), where active addresses spiked from 15,000 to 109,000. However, that momentum has since faded. As of now, daily active addresses have settled between 20,000 and 40,000, based on CryptoQuant’s latest data. The report paints a clear picture of how leading digital assets are moving in different directions. While Bitcoin and BNB have held their ground more effectively, ETH, SOL, and XRP have struggled to keep pace. CryptoQuant’s findings underscore the uneven impact of the current market correction and suggest that the next few months could be key in determining whether these trends deepen or reverse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What might this divergence mean for crypto’s long-term structure? The split may drive a reallocation of capital toward coins that deliver steady network metrics and lower volatility, potentially redefining market norms and investment strategies. How could these corrections influence risk management in crypto portfolios? Investors might adopt more disciplined approaches by diversifying holdings and emphasizing assets with proven fundamentals, leading to a strategic reassessment of exposure and risk tolerance. Which emerging trends could gain favor as portfolios are rebalanced? Expect growing interest in projects that blend strong network effects with scalable, low-cost solutions, attracting long-term capital and sparking renewed innovation in blockchain protocols.

The bloc’s decision comes after Washington slapped a 25 percent tariff on the car industry and hinted at further measures next week. One EU diplomat told FT, “The Americans think that they are the ones with escalation dominance [in the trade war], but we also have the ability to do that,” stressing that the ultimate goal is to de-escalate tensions and reach a comprehensive trade deal. Officials believe that by targeting services where the US shows vulnerability, they can force Washington to come to the negotiating table. Brussels had already responded by imposing extra duties on up to €26 billion of US goods following tariffs on steel and aluminum. However, European officials say the scale of the Trump administration’s actions has forced the EU to consider using even more powerful trade tools. The EU’s legal framework targets intellectual property and contracts Under its Enforcement Regulation, strengthened in 2021 after an earlier trade dispute, the EU has the power to suspend intellectual property rights and exclude companies from public procurement contracts. A potential fightback might involve restrictions on the intellectual property rights of major tech companies. This could include a ban on Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network from winning government contracts. In fact, Italy is already rethinking its plans to acquire the system. “Services is where the US is vulnerable,” said a second diplomat. Moreover, Washington ran a €109 billion trade surplus with the EU in services in 2023, compared with a €157 billion deficit in goods. Economic risks and negotiation challenges loom ahead While some European diplomats are optimistic about reaching a deal quickly, they acknowledge that such an agreement would not automatically remove all the extra tariffs imposed by the US. “The view is that we have to respond. It is the only way to get a deal,” said a third EU diplomat, adding that previous attempts to talk had failed. Since the EU’s exports far outstrip its imports, the bloc would find it difficult to match the US tariffs on goods. Moreover, Brussels does not want to risk cutting off gas supplies from the United States, which are vital to the continent’s energy needs. “There are only so many goods imports from the US that the EU can target before that damages the economy too much,” explained David Henig from the European Centre for International Political Economy. “If you don’t want to target energy, there’s a limit to what can be done on goods. Whereas on services there is greater room for retaliation without so much harm to the economy.” Some experts argue that the EU might need to use its anti-coercion instrument, the “trade bazooka,” to inflict even more economic pain on the US. This tool could allow the European Commission to restrict activities by US banks, revoke patents, or prevent companies from receiving revenues from software updates or streaming. “I would advise the European Commission to use the ACI,” said Ignacio García Berrero, a former senior commission official who led negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a deal that was never finalized. Any retaliatory measures would be drafted by the European Commission but must gain the approval of a weighted majority of member states. EU countries are still negotiating the goods retaliation list that was drawn up in response to Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. For example, France has pressed for bourbon whiskey to be removed from the list to protect its own drinks industry. The commission has postponed measures covering jeans, motorcycles, and possibly soyabeans until April 12. These measures will be discussed with national leaders before a final decision is made. Diplomats and officials also noted that more tariffs on googs could be on the table in response to any US reciprocal tariffs expected from the White House next week . Brussels estimates these tariffs could be around 20 percent and might hit aircraft, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products.

It was a calculated attempt to put an end to the industry,” Marszalek said in a March 27 X post. ”The fact that we not only persevered but became stronger is a testament to our vision and the community supporting it. Onwards!” It comes seven months after the SEC issued a Wells notice to the crypto platform in August, signaling its intention to take legal action against the firm. We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com,” added Crypto.com’s chief legal officer Nick Lundgren in a March 27 statement, which accused the previous administration of abusing its authority to harm the crypto industry. Source: Kris Marszalek Crypto.com had filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October, two months after the Wells notice, accusing the Gary Gensler-led commission of overstepping its authority and taking a “misguided” approach to crypto regulation. SEC continues to roll back previous enforcement actions Crypto.com’s announcement follows a wave of other crypto investigations and lawsuits dropped by the SEC over the last five weeks, which affected the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, OpenSea and more recently, Immutable. The SEC also dismissed its civil enforcement action against crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW with prejudice on March 27. Related: Ripple will drop cross-appeal in SEC case, get refund from lower court ruling The SEC has adopted a far friendlier approach since Mark Uyeda started leading the commission as acting chair on Jan. 20 after the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler.

It also canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets on Jan. 23.

Ethereum Supply Drops & ADA Awaits Breakout,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdags-path-to-1-gains-clarity-after-recent-ama-ethereum-supply-drops-ada-awaits-breakout/,"Ethereum supply on exchanges has fallen to a level not seen in nearly ten years, yet price action remains lackluster, sparking renewed discussions in the ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) also sits in a cautious zone, with its next movement depending on a critical technical breakout. In contrast to these slow-moving scenarios, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gathering strong traction. Its recent AMA revealed detailed plans for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) along with a rollout to 10 major exchanges. As a result, analysts now expect BDAG to potentially reach $1 by 2025—positioning it among the best crypto to buy right now. Ethereum Market Shows Mixed Signals as Exchange Supply Declines The ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis points out that ETH holdings on centralised exchanges have reached the lowest point since 2015, hinting at a growing trend toward holding and staking. With just 8.97 million ETH remaining on exchanges, Santiment data indicates a 16.4% decrease over the past seven weeks. Still, ETH’s value has dropped nearly 47% from its peak last December. Technical signals remain weak, with Ethereum struggling to clear major resistance zones. Slower fee revenue, lower DeFi usage on the mainnet, and increasing competition from layer-2 platforms have all contributed to a blurry short-term picture for Ethereum. Cardano Price Prediction Depends on Crucial Breakout Zones Current Cardano (ADA) price prediction sees limited clarity as ADA trades near $0.72, falling 2% in the past day. A 25% dip in trading volume also signals decreased trader interest. Analysts note a symmetrical triangle forming, suggesting the next move could decide ADA’s near-term direction. From a technical viewpoint, the Cardano price prediction depends on a breakout. Moving past $0.74 could open the way to $0.83, while slipping under $0.70 could lead ADA toward $0.65. Liquidation zones at $0.71 and $0.73, as shown by on-chain metrics, reflect strong indecision among market players. BlockDAG Eyes $1 Mark as TGE Plans Go Viral in Recent AMA BlockDAG’s latest AMA revealed a full breakdown of what many are calling one of the most well-prepared launches in today’s crypto space. The team outlined specific steps for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), setting the stage for its official market debut. Among the key updates, BDAG will be fully tradable shortly after TGE. Work is already underway to ensure listings on 10 well-known centralised exchanges, including top-tier platforms that could drive stronger volume and attention. This upfront strategy has boosted confidence. Since the announcement, presale activity has surged. BlockDAG has now collected more than $207 million, with over 18.9 billion BDAG coins sold across 27 separate presale rounds. These milestones point to growing belief from the market, as many are eager to grab BDAG before it becomes openly available. This demand continues to push BDAG into the spotlight as the best crypto to buy right now. Outlook for BDAG remains positive. The coin has jumped 2380% already—from $0.001 in early rounds to $0.0248 in the current batch. Forecasts now suggest BDAG could reach $1 in 2025, supported by a clear rollout plan, planned listings, and solid early performance. This places BlockDAG among the top breakout projects under watch before it fully enters the market. Final Take! Ethereum’s reduced exchange supply signals long-term confidence, but weak price action still clouds its outlook, as outlined in the latest Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Cardano continues to hover in a narrow range, with any breakout likely to shape the short-term Cardano (ADA) price prediction. On the other hand, BlockDAG appears to be entering a new phase of rapid development. With its Token Generation Event strategy clearly outlined and exchange listings in progress, BDAG is building strong momentum. Analysts predict it could hit $1 in 2025, and with its current presale price at $0.0248, BDAG is now widely seen as the best crypto to buy right now.

Lookonchain notes on the social media platform X that the whale spent $5 million worth of Circle’s stablecoin, USDC , to buy TRUMP right after President Donald Trump posted “I LOVE $TRUMP” on his social media platform Truth Social. The whale then sold the TRUMP stash an hour later, booking a $207,000 loss. However, the loss pales in comparison to gains the whale made earlier this year when it spent 1.09 million USDC to buy 5.97 million TRUMP and booked a $108 million profit, according to Lookonchain. The president launched the Official Trump memecoin in mid-January, days before he took office. The asset has generated controversy in and out of crypto circles, raising questions of corruption in an already heavily questioned administration. Even Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said in January that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued TRUMP could be a violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

33767162,[object Object],1743120039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Bet Grows Bigger: The Blockchain Group Snaps Up 580 BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bet-grows-bigger-the-blockchain-group-snaps-up-580-btc/,"The Blockchain Group, a France-based blockchain solutions firm, recently announced its largest Bitcoin (BTC) purchase to date, acquiring 580 BTC. This marks the company’s third BTC acquisition since it began buying the digital asset in November 2024. The Blockchain Group Buys 580 Bitcoin In its most significant BTC acquisition so far, The Blockchain Group has purchased 580 BTC for approximately $50.64 million at an average price of $88,020 per coin. According to the announcement, the purchase was made through its Luxembourg-based subsidiary. Notably, the acquisition was financed through proceeds raised from a convertible bond issuance announced on March 6. The move aligns with the firm’s Bitcoin Treasury strategy. To recall, The Blockchain Group made its first BTC purchase in November 2024, acquiring 15 BTC at an average cost of $68,785 per coin. Its second purchase followed in December 2024, when it bought 25 BTC at an average price of roughly $97,692. Following its latest acquisition, the company’s total BTC holdings now stand at 620 BTC, with a total net asset value of slightly over $54 million at current market prices. According to data from Yahoo! Finance, The Blockchain Group’s stock (ALTBG.PA) closed today’s trading session at €0.4975 ($0.54), up 3.09% on the day. On a year-to-date basis, the company’s shares have surged by an impressive 65.78%, suggesting that its exposure to BTC has positively impacted its valuation. The Blockchain Group’s official website states that its pivot to Bitcoin is part of a broader strategy to optimize the use of its excess cash and financial instruments. Since its first BTC acquisition, the company’s stock has risen by 225%. Corporate BTC Adoption To Grow In 2025 Corporate adoption of Bitcoin is expected to pick up even further in 2025, driven not only by the digital asset’s intrinsic value but also by a favorable regulatory environment under pro-crypto US President Donald Trump’s administration. Earlier this week, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, Strategy, acquired an additional 6,911 coins, pushing its total holdings beyond 500,000 BTC. In the same vein, US-based financial services firm Fold Holdings announced the addition of 475 BTC to its corporate treasury earlier this month. As corporate adoption grows, several US states have also begun legislative processes to add BTC to their treasuries. For instance, Utah and Kentucky have recently made significant strides with their BTC reserve bills. Additionally, Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas recently revealed that close to 70% of his investment portfolio is allocated to Bitcoin and related assets. At press time, BTC trades at $86,838, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital currency|Strategy|the blockchain group,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-28 00:00:39

People are looking beyond flashy price charts. What they really want are the best crypto projects in 2025—ones with strong real-world use, powerful tech, and the chance for real growth. That’s why attention is turning to four key names: BlockDAG, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Each of these coins has its own strengths, and if current trends continue, they could see strong gains soon. BlockDAG: Is This the Next $1 Coin by 2025 with 3932% Growth? BlockDAG (BDAG) ranks high among the best crypto projects in 2025. It runs on a smart system called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which allows transactions to take place at the same time—no delays or traffic issues. This leads to faster processing and smooth performance, making it a great choice for developers building fast and reliable decentralised apps. In its presale, BlockDAG has brought in more than $207 million. A total of 18.9 billion BDAG coins have already been sold. At batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, and those who joined early have seen a return of 2,380%. Analysts say BDAG might reach $1 in 2025, which would be a 3,932% increase from where it is now. With the mainnet expected later this year and ten confirmed CEX listings in 2025, BlockDAG is seen as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for early access to high returns. XRP: Designed for Fast, Large-Scale Transfers XRP continues to gain ground as a top name in digital payments. The United Nations has mentioned XRP in relation to a possible cashless global system. There is even speculation about Donald Trump possibly including it in a US crypto reserve. Maximilian Staudinger, a well-known analyst, suggested XRP could help unlock $1.5 trillion from Nostro accounts used for cross-border payments. What makes XRP one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is its speed and ease of use. Some believe it may become part of official global reserves, and the interest around this continues to rise. It hasn’t yet broken past $3, but the selling pressure is lower now, with an RSI of 34. In the past 24 hours, XRP moved up 12.4%, now priced at $2.53. It’s showing steady movement, and many are watching to see if it can finally cross that $3 line. Solana (SOL): Potential ETF Launch May Drive 2025 Growth Solana’s strong point is its role as a fast and cheaper option compared to Ethereum. Since its 2020 launch, it has reached a market cap of $65.6 billion. Talks are going on about the SEC allowing spot ETFs for Solana in 2025, which could draw in users from traditional finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum have ETF approvals already, so some believe Solana could be next. Its price has fallen around 50% since its $260 high in January, mostly due to broader market conditions. The RSI is now at 57 and is moving slowly upward, suggesting demand is cooling for now. Still, many see Solana as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 if ETF approval happens and market activity rises again. Cardano (ADA): Focused on Careful Growth and Clear Plans Cardano, with its $25.2 billion market value, is aiming to grow as a serious option alongside Ethereum and Solana. There’s talk that Trump might also include ADA in the US crypto reserve idea. Charles Hoskinson, who co-created Ethereum, started Cardano in 2014 to offer something more stable and well-planned. One reason many view ADA as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is the team’s open way of working. Right now, ADA is staying around the $0.70 level with resistance at $1 and $1.10. These price levels show a slow but steady path. Its mix of clear growth, stability, and detailed progress has made ADA a strong option to follow. Best Crypto Projects in 2025– Final Remarks! Looking toward 2025, XRP is building a real use case in payments and may benefit from political moves. Solana is waiting for ETF chances, and Cardano keeps improving steadily with on-chain upgrades. However, BlockDAG stands out. With over 2,380% gains already and a price of $0.0248 in batch 27, many believe it could hit $1. A return of 3,932% would make it one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for those aiming for early growth with long-term value. It’s showing clear signs of being ready for the next big move.

The cloud provider sold 37.5 million shares at $40 each. It had initially planned to sell 49 million shares at $47 to $55 each, but a weaker-than-expected stock market posed difficulties for the company. The company initially sought to raise $4 billion at a $35 billion valuation, reporting $1.9 billion in revenue last year but still seeing a net loss of nearly $900 million. AI powerhouse Nvidia, an investor in CoreWeave, is anchoring the IPO with a $250 million order, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. CoreWeave is closely tied to bitcoin miner CoreScientific, which struck a multi-billion deal with the New Jersey-based firm to expand its artificial intelligence capabilities. Nvidia's own stock price is down 12% since the beginning of the year, The Information reported late Thursday, reflecting broader weakness in AI-focused firms.

President Donald Trump appears open to a deal that leaves some involvement for the Chinese company. Lawmakers such as Michigan Republican John Moolenaar have warned that any arrangement giving ByteDance continued control is a grave threat to US security and a violation of American law. At a TikTok Coalition event on Thursday, Moolenaar said, “Any deal that allows ByteDance to maintain control of TikTok is a grave threat to our security and a violation of US law. If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal – plain and simple.” Recent reports indicate that a prospective deal would allow ByteDance to retain a stake in TikTok. Under the proposal, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle. The move is part of talks led by the White House, centered on a “qualified divestiture.” The law mandates that a foreign adversary must no longer control the app, defined as holding a stake of 20 percent or more, while leaving room for the president to set the terms. President Trump is eager to “save” the app and would go to extra lengths. He has not clearly stated whether he would support ByteDance having a partial role in TikTok. On Wednesday, he said he might lower tariffs on China to secure Beijing’s support and would consider extending the April 5 deadline if no agreement is reached. Trump talks about the TikTok deal at the Oval Office. Source: Bloomberg The law originally set the deadline as January 19 with a one-time 90-day extension for progress, and Trump had extended it on his first day in office after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The forced sale law, passed last year as part of a foreign aid package, was enacted amid concerns that TikTok’s Chinese ownership might allow Beijing to conduct influence operations against the United States. While the law mandates a divestiture, free speech advocates warn that a ban would restrict Americans’ access to foreign media. It would violate the First Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January, maintaining pressure on TikTok to separate from its Chinese owner. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts stated that the US intelligence community had “no information” that ByteDance manipulated TikTok content to favor the Chinese government. On Monday, Markey, along with Senators Cory Booker and Chris Van Hollen, sent a letter urging Trump to work with Congress on a legal basis for any extension. Earlier this year, they and Representative Ro Khanna of California introduced a bill to extend the original January 19 deadline by 270 days. Some Republicans want pure TikTok divestiture Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack called for “an absolute pure divestiture” on Thursday. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, known as one of the strongest supporters, has yet to firmly take a stand on the need for complete divestiture, with reports indicating he is allowing the White House to handle the negotiations. When asked about President Trump’s recent remarks, Guo Jiakun, spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Beijing has stated its position on TikTok on multiple occasions. He added that China’s opposition to extra tariffs is “consistent and clear.” In January, China’s foreign ministry also expressed openness to a TikTok deal, noting that acquisitions should be “decided independently by companies” according to the law. Some reports have suggested that TikTok’s algorithm may be subject to export controls by China’s commerce ministry. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company’s revised investment policy now permits a portion of its corporate treasury and future borrowings to be invested directly into Bitcoin and stablecoins. Despite declining net sales, GameStop holds significant liquidity, reporting cash reserves of $4.77 billion as of February. This strategic pivot aligns closely with previous Bitcoin adoption moves by firms such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, both of which have seen notable stock appreciation after similar announcements . An announcement regarding Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gG8JRarIok — GameStop (@gamestop) March 25, 2025 GameStop’s Bitcoin investment further validates the cryptocurrency’s growing appeal among corporate treasuries, potentially attracting broader institutional participation and strengthening Bitcoin’s market position. MicroStrategy’s Growing Bitcoin Ambitions MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy, could accumulate more than one million Bitcoin by 2033—equating to nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply—according to analysts at Bernstein. Currently, the firm owns approximately 506,137 Bitcoin, purchased at an average cost of $66,608.

Bernstein forecasts Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by 2025 and possibly $1 million by 2033, driven by supportive monetary policies and strong capital markets. Under bullish market conditions, Strategy’s holdings could reach 5.8% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Strategy’s continued Bitcoin accumulation underscores institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Nonetheless, short-term volatility persists, with Bitcoin recently trading around $86,982, down 1.33% in the past 24 hours. U.S. Government Accelerates Digital Payment Transition President Donald Trump mandated a complete transition to digital federal payments by September 30, 2025, aiming to eliminate paper-based transactions. The administration expects annual taxpayer savings of approximately $657 million through reduced fraud and administrative costs. #ACH $SHx #Stronghold #NACHA Executive Orders March 25, 2025 Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account – Effective September 30, 2025 Read this: (e) The Secretary of the Treasury shall support agencies’ transition to digital payment methods, including… pic.twitter.com/Fs5dyq5FAb — Cpt. X (@DebunkJelpi) March 27, 2025 The executive order emphasizes electronic fund transfer (EFT) methods, including digital wallets, direct deposits, and debit cards, explicitly ruling out the adoption of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Trump’s administration maintains a clear stance against government-controlled digital currencies. This move toward digital payments may indirectly support increased Bitcoin adoption, as users shift toward decentralized digital assets rather than centralized digital currencies. Bitcoin Price Technical Outlook Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is consolidating near $87,220 within a symmetrical triangle formation on the 2-hour chart. Price action maintains key support at $86,800, reinforced by the 50-period EMA. Immediate resistance at $88,800 limits upside momentum, and a confirmed breakout above this level could target $90,750 and $92,800. On the downside, critical support levels remain at $86,400 and $84,870, with a sustained move below these zones potentially opening the door to $83,200. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral at 51, signaling balanced market sentiment. Traders should monitor volume closely to confirm the next major directional move.

Analyst Says A Weekly Close Above This Level Would Trigger A Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-imminent/,"The crypto market is still trying to recover from its crash in early March, and sentiment is currently fluctuating. Although the Fear & Greed Index is still in the fear zone, the Bitcoin price is now slowly pushing back toward $90,000, which has been slowly changing the sentiment among altcoins. Rekt Capital, an influential analyst on X, reignited hope for an incoming altcoin season with a key technical signal. According to the post, a breakout in the altcoin market cap could soon take shape if one critical condition is met. The analyst shared a chart and commentary suggesting that the next major rally may already be in motion, provided that the altcoin market cap can secure a weekly close above a particular level. Weekly Close Above $250 Billion Could Be The Game Changer The altcoin market cap reached a multi-month low in the first week of March after the crash that saw many cryptocurrencies shell out weeks of price gains within a short period. This crash briefly pushed the altcoin market cap below $200 billion, although it eventually closed the week above this threshold. However, this market cap has steadily been inching upwards in the last two weeks since the crash. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat At the time of writing, the altcoin market cap has risen back to around $249 billion. Technical analysis from crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that a weekly close above the $250 billion mark would mark a significant technical shift for alts. This level, highlighted in blue on the chart below, will be an important resistance level for crypto investors waiting for the altcoin season. The analyst noted that a decisive close above it would likely precede a breakout rally toward the $315 billion level, marked in red. That move wouldn’t just signal short-term bullishness; it would also serve as confirmation that the bottom for altcoins has already been established. However, even if the altcoin market cap were to surge quickly towards $315, there would still be some work to do to return in order to the recent high of $451 billion set in December 2024. Shallow Correction Points To Stronger Momentum Ahead For Altcoin The nature of the current correction from this $451 billion altcoin market cap adds more weight to the possibility of an altcoin rally. According to the analyst, the ongoing correction has only reached a 55% drawdown from its local high, notably shallower than the previous major altcoin bear market retracements of 69% and 85%. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Recent Crypto Dip Shows Decline May Be Over And Bulls Are Taking Charge The shallower decline in the current retracement is interpreted as a sign of growing market maturity among altcoins. This implies that the selling pressure may be waning and that bulls are preparing for a stronger push. It also means that the $425 billion altcoin market cap resistance is weakening as a point of rejection, which in turn increases the chances of a breakout at the next visit.

Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit, Lummis emphasized that Bitcoin’s scarcity , immutability, and storability make it a strong long-term asset for national stability. “If we hold for 20 years — according to the best available models — we could reduce our national debt by half,” she said, referring to the country’s eye-popping $36 trillion debt. Saylor and Lummis push for Bitcoin as America’s strategic reserve Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor , also sparked discussion at the summit, going so far as to say during his discussion with Lummis that Bitcoin is the “Manifest Destiny for the United States of America.” Lummis also argued for creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve, stressing that it should be treated similarly to current national reserves. “We have a strategic oil reserve, we have a strategic gold reserve, we have a strategic cheese reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold,” she said. Lummis also pointed out this classic way of the government converting mineral wealth into cash possessed by the government, which then invests it into diversified assets that still generate cash. She views Bitcoin as a next-generation answer to an ancestral monetary problem. “I’ve kind of been looking for the Bitcoin strategic reserve my whole life,” Lummis added, clarifying that she believes it’s Bitcoin that will shape the country’s economic destiny. Saylor’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic asset resonated beyond the summit. Within an hour of his statement being posted on X, Bitcoin saw a 0.11% increase, reaching $87,273.47. The asset’s market capitalization grew by 0.09% at press time. The market’s reaction indicated a big change in sentiment, with the Fear and Greed Index rising from a complacent 50 to a “Greed” status of 65. Witnessing this in such a short timeframe demonstrates Bitcoin’s impact not just beyond political discourse but also in terms of market dynamics. Saylor stands firm on $13 Million Bitcoin prediction, calls it the ultimate store of value Just recently, Saylor doubled down on his claim that Bitcoin’s price will go to $13 million over 20 years. While addressing the Digital Asset Summit, Saylor emphasized Bitcoin’s unique qualities as a scarce digital commodity, arguing that no other asset can compare. “I can stand here and I can tell you that I think the price of Bitcoin will go to $13 million over 20 years. I couldn’t say that about a security, right?” Saylor declared, highlighting Bitcoin’s legal status as a commodity rather than a security. According to Saylor, Bitcoin is the only asset immune to human corruption. He refers to its origin as a product of what he calls an “immaculate conception.” He noted that, unlike traditional commodities like gold or oil, which can be extracted in greater quantities when prices rise, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it the ultimate store of value. Bitcoin bears seize opportunity as bullish bets weaken ahead of $16.5B options expiry On March 28, bitcoin investors are preparing for the all-time high $16.5 billion monthly options expiry. Despite this, the real impact on the market would be low, with BTC dropping below $90,000 before blindsiding investors and invalidating many bullish positions. This transition offers Bitcoin bears a key chance to avoid a potential $3 billion loss, which may exert considerable pressure on the markets in the weeks ahead. The open interest in call (buy) options is $10.5 billion, while the open interest in put (sell) options is $6 billion. However, $7.6 billion worth of those calls are for prices of $92,000 or higher, requiring Bitcoin to rise 6.4% from its current value to become profitable before the March 28 expiry. This has greatly reduced the edge for bullish bets. Some analysts cite the ongoing global tariff war and the US government spending cuts that risk sending the economy into a recession as impacting Bitcoin’s price. Traders are concerned about slower growth—especially in the artificial intelligence space, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high on Feb. 19 only to dip 7%. The 40-day correlation has been above 70% since early March, but for the bulls, Bitcoin is still due for a decoupling from the stock market. This is driving optimism across the board, fueled by central banks expanding the monetary base and companies such as GameStop (GME), Rumble (RUM), Metaplanet (TYO:3350) and Semler Scientific (SMLR) adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On the other hand, the upcoming ADA competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is attracting investors thanks to a 15,240% upside forecast. As the price of ADA ultimately depends on overall market conditions as well as adoption, the presale frenzy of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its well-structured tokenomics are leading expectations for gains in exponential growth. Currently in Phase 3 of its 11-stage presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $5,400,000 and over 7,200 holders. This phase comes in at $0.02 and is nearly full with over to 95% sold out, with Phase 4 trekking up to $0.025 in price, a 25% increase. A launch price of $0.06 will earn first movers a quick 200% profit as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is listed. And post-launch projections have greater upside potential, with some observers targeting a climb above $1. Cardano (ADA): Hopeful signs, but a long uphill battle ahead Analysts are split on the potential of Cardano (ADA) following its recent performance. Currently trading at $0.70, Cardano (ADA) would need to boom 1,300% to scale the heights of $10 — not everyone considers it a lofty aim. Advocates cite its strong fundamentals such as scalability and security as well as growing integrations with DeFi. But skeptics also believe Cardano (ADA) gradual development speed can prevent fast price appreciation around the project. In the meantime, Cardano (ADA) looks speculative with its upside, while its competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has a more evident growth path backed by solid use cases. While Cardano (ADA) is dependent on a general phase of market speculation, the lending model and corresponding buy-pressure mechanisms built into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generate demand through a snapshot process that leads to out-competition in terms of percentage profit gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Creates Excitement A similar initiative is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform. The token considers not only its short term goals but also its long-term stability. This fast-paced development of the presale reflects strong buyers confidence. With Phase 3 nears completion. Phase 4 will open with a 25% gain for all buyers at $0.02 with guaranteed 200% returns upon launch. MUTM tokenomics enable sustained growth past the first listing. Ongoing demand is created by the platform’s revenue-driven buybacks and staking rewards, reducing selling pressure. Analysts believe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may prop up to the round of $1 which will still give Phase 3 investors over 4,900% profits on investments. Mutuum Finance emphasizes on Security. Smart contract audit coming from one of the top Blockchain security experts in the industry CertiK. Once completed the results will be found on the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) official channels and will be published thereafter. Why Cardano (ADA) Can’t Compete with MUTM For Short-Term Gains Even though the long-term prospects of Cardano are undeniable, the road to $10 is nothing more than ‘a wishful thinking moment’ in the hands of the market gods. By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a methodical, high-reward chance with clear milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale’s phased pricing model guarantees that early investors secure the bottom entry points, paving the way for maximum profit as the project moves forward. With the sale of Phase 3 almost complete, the opportunity to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02 is rapidly running out of time. Now is the prime time to get involved with a 25% price increase for the next stage looming on the horizon and entry prices set to soar.

After months of silence, the energy in the market has shifted overnight. Forget the old memes—this new wave is driven by fresh hype, viral moments, and tokens that know how to tap into culture and capital. Leading the charge? Solana-based Morning Routine (ROUTINE), which went viral in record time, and Dragoin ($DDGN) , a game-ready, dragon-themed Ethereum token that’s quickly becoming the most anticipated presale in crypto. With money flooding in and community momentum skyrocketing, the meme coin comeback of 2025 is already breaking records—and it’s only just beginning. Morning Routine: A Viral Video Turns Into a $19M Crypto Hit Morning Routine didn’t just launch—it erupted . It started in late March 2025, when fitness influencer Ashton Hall’s eccentric TikTok—complete with early wakeups, banana facials, and ice-cold water slaps—caught fire on X (formerly Twitter). The internet couldn’t stop watching. With more than 667 million views in just four days, it was only a matter of time before crypto pounced. Developers launched ROUTINE on March 21, riding the viral wave and linking the token directly to Hall’s now-famous routine. In only 48 hours, the token’s market cap shot up to $19 million as traders raced in. True to meme coin form, it wasn’t a smooth ride. ROUTINE dropped 57% in hours, hit a low near $8 million, and then exploded back by 88% to reclaim a $15 million cap by Monday. Over 100 early movers made more than $10,000 each. The coin’s story became a case study in how fast culture and crypto can collide—and create real profits. ROUTINE proved one thing: virality still moves markets. But while it sparked a flash, Dragoin is preparing to deliver something far more lasting—and potentially far more lucrative. Dragoin Is Gaining Fast—And It’s Built to Last While ROUTINE rides a wave of instant fame, Dragoin ($DDGN) is building a foundation that could carry it for the long run. It’s not just riding the meme wave—it’s upgrading it. Dragoin is a play-to-earn token with a real product, a strong roadmap, and a tokenomics model that’s built for those who want big upside and utility. Running on Ethereum, Dragoin has 200 billion tokens—half of which are allocated to a 25-stage presale that’s already heating up. Prices increase with every stage, rewarding those who get in early. And the unsold tokens? Gone forever. Burned. This isn’t just another drop—it’s a deflation-powered rocket. The real kicker? Dragoin offers an interactive Telegram game where users hatch, train, and battle dragons to earn $DDGN. It’s fun, addictive, and already pulling users into the ecosystem. With staking, airdrops, referral bonuses, and a plan to renounce the smart contract at launch, Dragoin is ticking all the right boxes—and it’s not even fully live yet. Dragoin’s presale began strongly, offering Stage 1 tokens at only $0.0000292. With a clear roadmap targeting a launch price of $0.002, investors have a golden chance for impressive gains nearing 6,700%. Acting early in the presale secures the best possible price, providing significant upside potential and setting participants up for long-term success. Early entry also strengthens investors’ community status and influence within the Dragoin ecosystem. Why Dragoin Could Be the Meme Coin That Doesn’t Fade ROUTINE reminded everyone how fast memes can turn into money—but Dragoin is showing what comes next. Today’s traders want more than just a meme. They want something they can hold, use, and believe in past the first pump. Dragoin delivers that. With built-in scarcity, community rewards, and real gameplay, it’s creating something most meme coins never do— retention . While ROUTINE and others spike and dip, Dragoin is laying track for something far more sustainable. Its presale progress proves the market is watching. People are buying in before the hype peaks. This is the moment when early decisions could become huge wins. If you’re waiting for the “next big thing,” it might already be in motion. Q2 2025 is shaping up to be the most electric moment for meme coins in years. Morning Routine brought the buzz—but Dragoin is shaping up to bring the real returns. For those who sat out the Dogecoin run, missed Shiba’s breakout, or jumped too late into PEPE or Bonk, Dragoin is the chance to get in early again —but this time, with smarter fundamentals and more long-term potential. With a powerful presale, an actual game, and a roadmap that’s already being executed, Dragoin isn’t just another meme—it’s the one everyone’s going to talk about after it takes off. The question is: will you be in before it does?

Digital platforms that handle transactions, store personal information, or manage digital assets can benefit from blockchain’s ability to improve security and efficiency. E-commerce, social media, financial services, gaming, streaming, and real estate are among the industries that can benefit the most from blockchain technology. Companies are beginning to see its value in making transactions safer, reducing costs, and increasing trust between users and service providers. E-Commerce Platforms: Secure transactions and Fraud Prevention Online shopping has grown quickly, but fraud and security risks continue to cause problems for both buyers and sellers. Many platforms deal with chargebacks, identity theft, and fake products. Blockchain helps by making transactions more secure and easier to verify. Transactions recorded on a blockchain cannot be changed or reversed without permission, which stops chargeback scams and protects sellers from losses. Websites like eBay and AliExpress could use blockchain to support cryptocurrency transactions, making transactions faster and reducing reliance on banks. Some companies, including Shopify and Overstock, have already introduced blockchain-based transactions to improve security and build trust with their customers. Blockchain also helps verify where products come from. By scanning a blockchain-verified code, buyers can check if a product is real and track its journey from the manufacturer to their hands. This is useful for high-end goods and electronics, where counterfeit items are a common issue. Gaming Platforms: Fairness, Security, and Digital Ownership More gaming platforms are starting to use blockchain to improve security and make sure digital transactions are fair. Many online games now have systems where players can buy, sell, or trade virtual items. Blockchain helps by making these transactions more secure and allowing players to fully own their digital assets without the risk of them being changed or taken away. This technology is useful beyond gaming as well. Online learning platforms, virtual workspaces, and creative tools also benefit from better security and verified ownership of digital content. By using blockchain, these platforms can protect user data and ensure that digital records cannot be altered. Online casino platforms have started exploring blockchain technology to improve different aspects of their services. The rise in popularity of games such as slots has led to more people signing up, which means their personal data will need better protection. By integrating blockchain, online casino platforms can address security concerns, improve transaction efficiency, and offer transparency in game outcomes. This technology provides a way to maintain fair operations while giving users a verifiable record of their activity. Social Media Platforms: Data Privacy and Content Ownership Social media platforms store a lot of personal data, which makes them a common target for hackers. Many people are concerned about how their information is used and if outsiders can access it without permission. Blockchain can make social media safer by giving users control over their own data instead of leaving it in the hands of big companies. With blockchain-based social media, posts, messages, and personal details could be encrypted and stored across a secure network rather than kept on company-owned servers. This would make it harder for hackers to steal information and reduce the risk of large-scale data breaches. Platforms like Facebook, X, and Instagram have faced criticism for privacy concerns, while newer platforms like Minds and Mastodon are exploring blockchain-based alternatives that give users more control over their data. Fake accounts and misinformation are other problems that blockchain could help solve. By using a verification system built on blockchain, social media platforms could confirm that users are real people rather than bots or fraudulent accounts. This would help reduce spam, fake news, and manipulated engagement. Streaming Platforms: Content Protection and Royalty Transactions Streaming platforms for music, movies, and online courses often face problems with content ownership and making sure artists and creators get paid fairly. Blockchain can help by using smart contracts that automatically send transactions to creators whenever their content is accessed. With blockchain, streaming platforms like Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube could track exactly how many times a song, film, or online lesson is played and send transactions directly to the creator without needing a third party to process them. Some music platforms, like Audius, are already using blockchain to give artists more control over their earnings. Blockchain also helps stop unauthorized copies from spreading. When a song, movie, or course is registered on a blockchain, its ownership is recorded in a way that cannot be changed.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-28 01:02:48

This article will dive into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Toshi, and Book of Meme, with a special focus on the presale excitement surrounding APC and why it could be the next big crypto success. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Strategy: Boosting Scarcity and Value Scarcity drives value in cryptocurrency, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is leveraging this principle with an aggressive token burn mechanism. Unsold tokens during the presale are permanently eliminated every week, ensuring that supply remains controlled. Additionally, once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment designed to enhance long-term value.

Musk stated that his Department of Government Efficiency is set to achieve these savings within 130 days from the start of Trump’s term on January 20. Musk explained that the plan would involve cutting more than half of the $1.8 trillion spent on non-defense discretionary programs in 2024. “I think we will accomplish most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that time frame,” he said. The billionaire added that his aim is to cut 15% of the government’s annual spending, which totaled $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He confidently said that these reductions could be made without affecting any of the critical government services. Musk, classified as a special government employee who is allowed to work only 130 days out of the year as a temporary federal worker, spoke of a sweeping reform effort. DOGE is still far from reaching the $1 trillion target The interview came just days after President Trump said he expected to be “satisfied” with DOGE’s cuts in the coming month or two. Trump acknowledged that the overhauls led by DOGE are not “necessarily a very popular thing to do,” noting the political risks tied to such wide-ranging cuts. Most of the federal government’s spending is allocated to mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security, where there is little room for reductions. Musk has claimed that these programs are overrun with fraud and waste, though he did not provide supporting evidence for these assertions.In response, DOGE has deployed at least 10 staffers to the Social Security Administration to identify waste. However, data shows that from 2015 through 2022, Social Security estimated nearly $72 billion in improper payments, which makes less than 1% of benefits paid, according to an inspector general report from last year. The DOGE website, which has been criticized for errors and overstatements, currently lists about $22 billion in contract savings. The website also claims about $130 billion in overall cost reductions, although these figures are not itemized. Musk has downplayed the effect of job cuts Musk’s DOGE has also pushed a series of federal government layoffs that have been implemented in the past few weeks. While several agencies have announced workforce reductions, Musk dismissed the impact of these job cuts by saying that “almost no one’s gotten fired.” Among the recent changes, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a cut of 10,000 jobs earlier on Thursday. In March the Education Department stated that it was reducing its workforce by half. Moreover, the Small Business Administration is cutting 43% of its workforce. The Department of Veterans Affairs has announced plans to layoff 80,000 workers, while the Treasury Department shared major cuts planned in a court filing. DOGE’s efforts have also faced legal hurdles. This includes judges rejecting some of the proposed cuts and blocking Musk’s team from accessing certain systems and databases such as those at the Social Security Administration.

In a statement on Thursday, Crypto.com confirmed that the SEC would not be pursuing any enforcement action against the company. The SEC has yet to respond to requests for comment. Under the previous administration, the SEC weaponized and attempted to expand its congressionally granted power to harm an industry that its former chair disfavored, according to Crypto.com Chief Legal Officer Nick Lundgren. He added that it was unfortunate they had to endure a years-long investigation and file their own lawsuit against the SEC to protect the rule of law. The SEC has recently dismissed multiple investigations and lawsuits against crypto firms, including those involving Kraken and Coinbase. Earlier this month, the agency also opted to drop its appeal in the case against Ripple. Crypto.com’s legal battle and the SEC’s changing stance on crypto regulation Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October after receiving a Wells notice, signalling the potential for charges. In its lawsuit, Crypto.com argued that the SEC had overreached its jurisdiction and challenged the agency’s stance that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. That lawsuit was dropped in December. The regulatory watchdog has changed significantly over the past several weeks following the beginning of the Trump administration and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s exit at the beginning of the year. Since the year began, the SEC has rescinded controversial crypto accounting guidance, dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players and formed a crypto task force. Additionally, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s pick for the SEC chairmanship, Paul Atkins, faced questions from lawmakers about the agency’s past actions and his ties to bankrupt FTX. Atkins said he planned to make creating a regulatory framework for digital assets a “top priority.” According to its statement, Crypto.com serves more than 140 million customers worldwide. In a notable development, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. announced earlier this week that it had signed a non-binding agreement with Crypto.com to collaborate on launching a range of exchange-traded funds and products under the Truth.Fi fintech brand. SEC drops multiple crypto cases, but some firms still face uncertainty In the fewer than three months since U.S. President Donald Trump took office, the SEC’s investigations into crypto exchange Gemini, trading platform Robinhood, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, NFT company Yuga Labs, and Immutable, and now Crypto.com have all been dropped, with no enforcement charges filed. The agency’s litigation against crypto companies, including Kraken, Coinbase, ConsenSys, Ripple, and Cumberland DRW, has also been dropped. Still, more litigation has been paused, including the SEC’s cases against Tron and Binance. But, not everyone who received a Wells notice is off the SEC’s hook yet. Crypto issuer Unicoin received a Wells notice last year informing the firm that the SEC planned to bring charges alleging violations related to fraud, deceptive practices and the offer and sale of unregistered securities. A spokesperson for Unicoin recently said that the firm “remains in the final stages of the SEC review process. The spokesperson noted: “As of now, we have not received any new updates or formal feedback from the SEC regarding our registration. We are fully committed to compliance and transparency, and we continue to work toward securing the necessary approvals for our planned offerings.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Attributes such as initial progress, expanding supporter bases, or significant advancements on the horizon, some ventures are distinguishing themselves. XRP, BlockDAG, Aptos, and Celestia have all garnered attention for various reasons, and not solely from the typical audience. As the cryptocurrency market evolves and new challengers emerge, these four merit close observation. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Substantial Expansion, Vast Return Possibilities BlockDAG (BDAG) is an advanced Layer 1 protocol engineered for extensive scalability. Contrary to conventional blockchains that decelerate under load, it utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture to execute transactions concurrently—enhancing speed without compromising efficiency. This structure is optimal for supporting a wide range of applications from DeFi to gaming and financial transactions. Beyond theoretical advantages—concrete figures support this. BlockDAG has successfully secured over $207 million in its presale phase, distributed over 18.9 billion coins, and achieved a price increase from $0.001 to $0.0248—marking a 2,380% rise in just 27 batches. The real intrigue lies in the projected long-term gains. With current progress and ecosystem growth, analysts predict up to a 30,000x ROI for early participants. This projection has attracted over 170,000 unique holders, with significant events such as the mainnet launch and numerous exchange listings forthcoming. For those evaluating their options and seeking the best long term crypto for higher returns, BlockDAG presents a compelling combination of robust fundamentals and potential for expansion. This isn”t just speculation—it’s a momentum supported by tangible achievements. 2. XRP (XRP): Momentum Builds as Legal Hurdles Clear XRP is renowned for its ability to accelerate international payments—completing transactions in just seconds at low costs. It ranks as one of the leading altcoins with a market cap of $13 billion. The lengthy SEC lawsuit that cast doubt on its future has concluded, clearing significant obstacles. Since the case closed, XRP has maintained a stable price around $2.39, with optimistic forecasts suggesting a rise to between $5 and $100 in future years. While these predictions are speculative, the newfound legal clarity might attract renewed interest. For those searching for the best long-term crypto for higher returns, XRP now faces fewer obstacles. 3. Aptos (APT): Is Speed the Key to Its Value Over Time? Aptos boasts a high-speed blockchain, capable of processing up to 160,000 transactions per second with parallel execution. Developed using the Move language and supported by a Proof-of-Stake consensus, it’s rapidly becoming the go-to platform for developers creating scalable dApps. Aptos has recently reached about 15 million monthly users and ranks as the fourth-largest blockchain by daily transactions. Its current price is approximately $5.45, with future values potentially reaching between $26 and over $100 by 2030. For those looking at the best long-term crypto for higher returns, Aptos offers robust technical foundations paired with increasing practical application. 4. Celestia (TIA): Promising Potential for Sustained Gains Celestia (TIA) introduces a modular approach to blockchain by separating data availability from execution, thus improving scalability. The TIA token supports the network’s proof-of-stake mechanism, allowing users to stake tokens with validators for rewards. Developers use TIA for data storage costs within Celestia’s unique blobspace, enhancing roll-up operations without separate gas tokens. Currently, TIA trades at about $3.31, with predictions for 2025 ranging from $7.81 to $14.23, and by 2030, potentially hitting up to $47.47. For those seeking the best long-term crypto for higher returns, Celestia’s groundbreaking structure and tokenomics offer an attractive prospect. The Bottom Line These altcoins each present unique strengths—XRP with its transaction speed and clear legal status, Aptos with its scalable technology, and Celestia with its modern blockchain design. Yet, BlockDAG leads the pack for various reasons. BlockDAG isn’t just capitalizing on initial buzz—the data already indicates significant progress, and the potential for substantial growth is undeniable. With consistent price increases and a forecasted 30,000x ROI, BlockDAG stands out as a top choice for the best long term crypto for higher returns. The opportunity is narrowing, suggesting now might be the time to consider BDAG at current levels.

The strong rebound follows a brutal correction in which AVAX lost over 72% of its value since mid-December 2024, triggering widespread capitulation and fear across the market. Now, with price action showing signs of strength, investors are cautiously optimistic — but uncertainty remains. Related Reading: Solana Tags Upper Bollinger Band For First Time Since ATH — Is Momentum Returning? While the recent rally has brought some relief, many analysts believe the market may be entering a consolidation phase. AVAX is currently struggling to hold above the $22 mark, a key resistance level that could determine whether the uptrend continues or stalls. Several technical signals are flashing caution as momentum begins to slow. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, pointing out that the TD Sequential indicator is now presenting a fresh sell signal. This suggests that AVAX may be due for a short-term pullback or a period of sideways movement. With the broader market still under pressure, traders are watching closely to see whether Avalanche can maintain its gains or lose momentum. Avalanche Wakes Up But Faces Serious Risks Avalanche is showing signs of life after enduring months of intense selling pressure. Like many altcoins, AVAX has been heavily impacted by macroeconomic volatility, losing over 70% of its value since mid-December 2024. Now, as bullish momentum begins to return across select altcoins, Avalanche is attempting to stage a recovery rally. The recent 53% surge since March 11 has revived hopes that AVAX could be ready to break out — but headwinds still remain. The broader market environment continues to be shaped by uncertainty. Trade war fears and unstable macroeconomic signals have kept pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Many investors remain cautious and are still offloading positions near current levels, concerned about the long-term direction of the market. While momentum is returning to some sectors, the path for Avalanche is far from clear. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a technical development using the TD Sequential indicator. After accurately calling the recent bottom and a 50% rally in AVAX, the indicator is now flashing a sell signal. This suggests that Avalanche could be due for a short-term retrace or period of consolidation before any further move higher. The $22 level remains a crucial resistance zone for AVAX. A temporary cooldown here may be healthy — giving bulls time to regroup before attempting a breakout. If AVAX can hold key support and reset after the current rally, it could build a stronger foundation for a decisive push above $22 in the weeks ahead. For now, all eyes are on price action as Avalanche balances between correction and continuation in a market still clouded by uncertainty. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Realized Price – Bulls Face Strong Resistance At $2,300 AVAX Struggles Below $22 As Bulls Aim For $30 Breakout Avalanche (AVAX) is currently trading at $21.80 after briefly reaching $23.40 just two days ago. The recent pullback reflects cooling momentum as bulls struggle to maintain pressure near short-term resistance. Still, the trend remains intact — for now. To sustain the recovery rally, bulls must defend current levels and push toward reclaiming the $30 mark, which aligns with the 200-day moving average (MA) and 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). A successful breakout above this zone would be a strong bullish signal and could mark the beginning of a larger uptrend. However, failure to hold above $20 in the coming days would be a warning sign. A breakdown below this level could trigger increased selling pressure and send AVAX back toward the $17 zone — a key support area from previous consolidations. As Avalanche continues to trade within a volatile range, the next few sessions will be crucial in determining short-term direction.

He pointed out that there was no strong conviction yet to ‘play Europe over the US over the next six-to-12 months’. Boivin predicted that the U.S. would see the strongest earnings growth within the coming six-to-12 months. The strategist said a 10% tariff was likely the best possible landing zone, and the US can adjust to that. However, he cautioned that the tariffs would be a ‘different story’ if they exceeded 10%. Charlie Bilello, the chief market strategist at Creative Planning, also said that U.S. stocks had been outperforming international stocks by a big margin for 16 years running. According to Bilello, the U.S. was now more than three standard deviations above the mean in terms of historical outperformance. Boivin favors U.S. stocks over European equities US equities will soon regain their long-held edge over European peers, according to Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute https://t.co/ulgY1BnrSr — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 27, 2025 Boivin said US equities will soon regain their long-held edge over European stocks, as the future of European stocks was limited to sectors such as defense and banks. He added that he expected U.S. earnings downgrades to be short-lived as tariff-related uncertainty came to an end. However, UBS’s chief strategist Bhanu Baweja said this week he expected the S&P 500 to drop another 8% as a consumer slowdown continued to squeeze corporate earnings. Keith Lerner, the Co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Market Strategist at Truist Advisory Services, also said the US outperformed Europe by 20% since December, but markets did not move in straight lines. He pointed out that Europe’s defense-driven rally may pause, while US fiscal stimulus offered short-term opportunities. “The US is the place where we expect to see the strongest earnings growth on a six-to-12 month horizon.” – Jean Boivin As per Reuters reports on March 27th, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 20.71 points or 0.05% to 42,478.39, the S&P 500 (.SPX) climbed 6.42 points or 0.12% to 5,718.66, and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) advanced 21.25 points or 0.09% to 17,920.27. Meanwhile, European stocks fell, with weakness in shares of Europe’s top carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) down nearly 2%, BMW (BMWG.DE) losing almost 3%, and Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) sliding more than 4%. U.S. economy has grown faster than expected since the end of 2024 A Commerce Department report on March 27th revealed that the U.S. economy grew a little faster than expected in the final three months of 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also said in its last of three estimates that the U.S. GDP accelerated at a 2.4% pace for the October-through-December period. That was 0.2 percentage points ahead of the previous estimate and came from an upward revision to consumer spending, which grew at a 4% rate in the fourth quarter. In addition to the upward change in GDP, the BEA noted that core inflation was a bit softer than previously indicated. The personal consumption expenditures price index (excluding food and energy prices), which the Federal Reserve uses as its primary inflation gauge, increased by 2.6%, down 0.1 percentage points from the prior estimate. CNBC also reported that the major indexes were clinging to marginal gains as stocks flitted between gains and losses this week. The S&P 500 ticked up nearly 0.8%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.5%. The 30-stock Dow has also added 1% this week thus far. Within the S&P 500 sectors, communication services, consumer discretionary, and financials saw the largest gains, whereas utilities, health care, and real estate were the main decliners. However, sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose in February, recovering from a drop in January. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of the first to take part in the trend, posting a portrait of himself generated by the model on March 25 but said in a subsequent post two days later that all image requests have started to tax the firm’s infrastructure. “It’s super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT but our GPUs are melting. We are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient,” he said. Source: Sam Altman “Also, we are refusing some generations that should be allowed; we are fixing these as fast we can,” he added. OpenAI launched the upgraded image generation offering in ChatGPT-4o on March 25, resulting in users splashing images across social media in the art style of Studio Ghibli — known for its anime films Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro . Altman didn’t give a definitive timeline on how long the rate limits would last but said, “Hopefully, it won’t be long! ChatGPT free tier will get three generations per day soon.” Rate limits are generally applied to help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure, according to OpenAI. Related: Ghibli memecoins surge as internet flooded with Studio Ghibli-style AI images “If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users,” OpenAI says on its rate limit explanation page. Along with the legions of others getting in on the trend, X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared an image mimicking King Mufasa from Disney’s The Lion King holding up a Shiba Inu. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks also joined in, using the Studio Ghibli-art style on an image of himself at an event. Source: David Sacks Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported on March 26 that OpenAI expects to more than triple its revenue this year to $12.7 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter. Altman said on Feb. 12 his firm wants to ship GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the coming weeks or months.

That future is unfolding right now with Qubetics, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI), and Quant. Each of these projects is pushing blockchain technology into uncharted territories, solving critical inefficiencies in digital finance and beyond. Qubetics is leading the best penny crypto to buy and charge with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Meanwhile, ASI’s groundbreaking SQD XSpaces upgrade is redefining AI-driven blockchain automation. Quant continues its mission to enhance blockchain interoperability, partnering with Oracle to revolutionize digital assets. Qubetics: The Best Penny Crypto to Buy in 2025 Qubetics is a next-generation blockchain project designed to tokenize real-world assets, making them tradable, accessible, and liquid. Through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, physical and financial assets can be digitized and exchanged securely, removing barriers that have long restricted asset ownership to select entities. Imagine a scenario where a property owner wants to liquidate assets without selling the entire property. Through Qubetics, they can tokenize their real estate, allowing fractional ownership while maintaining control over their property. Similarly, businesses can tokenize high-value assets like intellectual property, machinery, or fine art, providing instant liquidity without traditional banking restrictions. With Qubetics ($TICS) currently priced at $0.1300 in its crypto presale , even a modest $100 investment secures around 769 tokens. Based on the latest stats—over $15.5 million raised, 504 million $TICS tokens sold, and a rapidly expanding base of 23,900+ holders—the project’s momentum is undeniable, one of the best penny crypto to buy. Now, consider the potential: if $TICS reaches just $1, that $100 turns into $769. At $5, it climbs to $3,845. Push it to $10, and you’re looking at $7,690. But if $TICS hits $15, that small $100 outlay could explode into a staggering $11,535, representing a potential 11,437% ROI. In a market where many projects still lack direction or utility, Qubetics stands out as a presale delivering both numbers and real-world impact. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI): AI & Blockchain Innovation ASI is rapidly gaining attention in the AI-blockchain sector, especially with the rollout of the SQD XSpaces upgrade, which introduces cutting-edge enhancements in smart contract security, AI-assisted trading, and DeFi automation. This technological leap positions ASI at the forefront of AI-driven blockchain ecosystems. Another major milestone is the ASI token merger, which consolidates SingularityNET (AGIX) and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) into Fetch.ai’s FET token. This strategic unification is designed to streamline interoperability and operational efficiency, creating a cohesive infrastructure for AI-based decentralized applications. In terms of market activity, FET is currently priced at $0.556269, with a 24-hour trading volume of $112.19 million. Despite a 4.11% dip in the past 24 hours, the momentum surrounding ASI’s developments suggests growing market confidence in its long-term vision. Quant: The Powerhouse of Blockchain Interoperability Quant continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain interoperability, especially as it bridges the gap between decentralized systems and traditional finance. Its recent partnership with Oracle marks a pivotal advancement—integrating Overledger technology into Oracle’s blockchain infrastructure to enable frictionless cross-chain transactions across enterprise environments. Quant’s growing influence is further highlighted by its participation in Project Rosalind, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative led by the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub and the Bank of England. This involvement underscores Quant’s commitment to shaping the future of digital finance at an institutional level. On the market front, QNT is trading at $77.66, with a 24-hour volume of $19.93 million, reflecting a 2.54% decline in the last 24 hours. Despite the dip, Quant’s integration with major financial entities signals strong long-term utility and resilience. The Future of Blockchain: Qubetics, ASI, & Quant Blockchain technology is undergoing a major transformation. Qubetics is revolutionizing real-world asset tokenization, ASI is pioneering AI-powered automation, and Quant is breaking down blockchain barriers. For those looking for projects with real utility, Qubetics stands out as the best penny crypto to buy in 2025. With its explosive presale performance, Qubetics is proving to be more than just another token—it’s an entirely new financial infrastructure. Those who recognize its potential now are positioning themselves ahead of the next major shift in blockchain technology.

Bpifrance said in a March 27 press release that it would back newly formed projects “with a strong French footprint” where it will receive tokens in return for its investment and will look to fund decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, tokenization and artificial intelligence. It added that the plan, supported by the French Ministry of Economy and Finance, was to “promote emerging technologies and strengthen the French blockchain ecosystem.” The global blockchain ecosystem is “currently booming” but the number of French funds taking part is still very limited, it said. French digital and AI minister Clara Chappaz said public and private financing was “one of the keys to the sustainable positioning of our ecosystem on the international stage.” Bpifrance deputy CEO Arnaud Caudoux said that it was convinced of the growing importance that blockchain companies “will take on in the years to come and want to increase French competitiveness and presence in the digital assets field.” “The US is really accelerating its own crypto strategy, so this is all the more important,” Caudoux said at a press conference, as reported by Reuters. He added that Bpifrance had started to support crypto before the US started its own pro-crypto moves. Bpifrance’s headquarters in Paris. Source: Google The bank said it had backed the blockchain sector for a decade and had invested over 150 million euros ($162 million), notably helping to finance the crypto hardware wallet company Ledger in 2014. Bpifrance said it began testing limited investments through tokens in 2022, including a deal with the DeFi lending platform Morpho to buy its token — which has grown to be the 12th largest protocol by value at $3.24 billion, according to DefiLlama.

PitchBook expects crypto VC deals to top $18 billion this year , a marked increase from the $13.6 billion raised in 2024 . Typically, a crypto platform that launches a token will allocate a portion of its supply to financiers subject to varying lockup periods where the tokens can’t be sold. A portion of the token supply is usually immediately given to select public users in order to drum up liquidity, which can cause token values to slide if they cash out.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal describes the dismissal of the staking lawsuit as the falling of dominoes, eyeing more states to toe the same line. South Carolina Terminates Staking Lawsuit After nearly two years, South Carolina is changing its stance on Coinbase staking. According to an announcement , South Carolina is ditching its lawsuit against the exchange regarding the provision of staking services to users. Going forward, Coinbase says it will begin rolling out staking services for South Carolina residents. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal notes that the exchange is keen on putting a torrid two-year period behind it and relaunching staking services. According to Grewal, South Carolina residents have lost nearly $2 million in staking rewards following the legal battle. Carolina joins a growing number of states to reverse their stance on Coinbase staking. “This is not just a victory for us, but for American consumers and we hope it’s a sign of things to come in the few states left that restrict staking,” said Grewal. US authorities have softened their stance on staking with industry giants like CBOE filing for staking in Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF. Coinbase Enjoys A String Of Regulatory Victories Coinbase is on a red-hot streak of regulatory victories in recent weeks. At the top of the pile is the SEC’s dismissal of its lawsuit against Coinbase without prejudice, triggering excitement. Coinbase has filed an FOIA request against the SEC to probe the financials of its regulatory actions against the industry. Meanwhile, the exchange is pursuing similar information discovery against the FDIC with Grewal criticizing the handling of the FOIA request. The top exchange has set up shop in India after a two-year hiatus, clinching approval from local regulators. Coinbase acquisition of Deribit is considered a major move in the ecosystem claims of self-centric motives over the exchange’s silence in Ripple’s case have soured sentiments.

Presales offer investors an opportunity to buy in at a fixed and discounted rate, therefore maximizing upside potential. These presale events can provide substantial gains in bullish periods like the one we’re currently entering. With that in mind, here are the five best crypto presales to buy now: Solaxy Solaxy is working toward a new era for Solana, building its first-ever layer 2 blockchain. It uses off-chain computation and transaction bundling technology to tackle Solana’s congestion issue, which it has grappled with for years. With over $27 million raised, Solaxy’s presale success reflects the market’s trust. The project will make Solana cheaper, faster, and more scalable. This will, in effect, open Solana to new use cases and expand its current ones, such as meme coins, AI, and DeFi. Given that Solana is worth over $65 billion, the potential impact that Solaxy could make creates a massive opportunity for the $SOLX token to rise in price. It’s clear that investors are well aware of this potential, given the project’s presale momentum. Therefore, prospective investors hoping to get in early should act quickly. Visit Solaxy Presale BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token is a Bitcoin-themed meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. But it isn’t just a meme coin – it’s the first cryptocurrency to pay its community Bitcoin rewards. It’s a setup that economically aligns the performance of BTC Bull Token with that of Bitcoin. The higher Bitcoin’s price goes, the more valuable BTC Bull Token rewards become. The project will pay Bitcoin and BTC Bull Token rewards to holders at key milestones on Bitcoin’s journey to $1 million – starting when it hits $100K. As Bitcoin rises, it tends to drag the rest of the market up with it. Therefore, BTC Bull Token holders will simultaneously benefit from price appreciation and a growing position of $BTC and $BTCBULL. There are also staking and burning mechanisms to help boost the project’s supply and demand dynamics. The $BTCBULL presale has raised $4 million so far. By aligning meme coin virality with Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, BTC Bull Token is one of the most promising presales on the market. Visit BTC Bull Token Presale MIND Of Pepe MIND Of Pepe is a Pepe-themed AI agent operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The project grasps the current market dynamics while also positioning for the future. The meme coin market is thriving right now, but it seems that the AI agent sector is also making a comeback. It saw a huge boom in December and is now waking up again, with its trading volume jumping 24% today. As the next AI agent rally approaches, MIND Of Pepe is set for considerable success. The project will identify trading opportunities and share them with $MIND holders. It can also launch tokens and interact with dApps, all for the betterment of the community. Moreover, the agent introduces a technology called “hive mind analysis,” which allows it to learn from the data it collects and become more powerful over time. The presale has raised $7.5 million so far. By blending the allure of Pepe coin with cutting-edge AI utility, MIND Of Pepe separates itself from other meme coins and AI agents on the market. Visit MIND Of Pepe Presale Best Wallet Token Best Wallet token is the new cryptocurrency that will power multichain crypto wallet Best Wallet. The wallet is packed with features to make life easier when trading on-chain. However, one of its main pillars is Upcoming Tokens, a presale aggregator that allows users to buy promising new presales directly from the app. Some previous projects listed on Upcoming Tokens, such as Pepe Unchained and Catslap, provided investors with gains of between 10x and 50x. Best Wallet also offers a cross-chain DEX, a crypto debit card, a staking aggregator, derivatives trading, and much more. The $BEST token provides trading fee discounts, higher staking yields, governance rights, and access to promotions on partner projects. So far, the $BEST presale has raised $11.3 million, illustrating strong demand. But with $BEST allowing users to save money and gain new opportunities, there’s every chance its demand continues to soar as the wallet gains more eyeballs, giving it serious price potential. Visit Best Wallet Token Presale Meme Index Every day, new meme coins emerge, and early traders get rich. But with projects launching all the time, it’s hard to keep track. While it can be highly lucrative, meme coin trading is also risky. Meme Index understands this and provides a solution. It’s building the world’s first decentralized meme coin index investing app. These indexes are like meme-styled ETFs. They contain a range of different meme coins. Buying the index gives price exposure to them all, spreading risk and increasing the chances of catching a winner. Four indexes are available, each with a different level of volatility and risk. This means there’s something for all investors. Like Best Wallet token, utility is at the heart of $MEMEX. Users must hold it to access the platform, and it also provides governance and staking rights. Meme Index could change how investors trade meme coins, and if it does, there will be massive demand for $MEMEX. Visit Meme Index Presale Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

The new proposal — made by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in a Technical Advice report to the European Commission on March 27 — would set a far stricter standard than other asset classes, such as stocks and real estate, which don’t even need to be half-backed. “EIOPA considers a 100% haircut in the standard formula prudent and appropriate for these assets in view of their inherent risks and high volatility,” it said in a separate statement. Such a measure would fill a regulatory gap between the Capital Requirements Regulation and Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), EIOPA said, noting that the European Union’s regulatory framework for insurers currently lacks specific provisions on crypto assets. Circle argued in January that a blanket 100% stress factor on crypto assets didn’t account for lower-risk stablecoins. Source: Circle EIOPA outlined four options for the European Commission to consider — one: make no changes; two: mandate an 80% “stress level” to crypto assets; and three: mandate a 100% stress level to crypto asset. The stress level percentages determine how much capital firms need to hold to stay solvent. The fourth option called on the European Commission to consider the risks of tokenized assets more broadly. EIOPA said option three would be the most appropriate option. “An 80% stress to the value of crypto-asset exposures does not appear sufficiently prudent,” whereas “a 100% stress is more appropriate and aligns with one of the approaches to the transitional treatment of crypto-assets under CRR,” EIOPA said. The 100% stress refers to the assumption that the crypto asset prices could fall by 100% and that diversification — spreading the risk across different assets — wouldn’t not reduce this stress. EIOPA pointed out that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) have fallen 82% and 91%, respectively, in the past. A 100% capital charge for crypto assets would reflect a far stricter approach compared to stocks, which range between 39% and 49%, and real estate, which incurs a 25% capital charge, according to solvency capital requirements laid out in the Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. EIOPA said a 100% capital charge for crypto asset-related (re)insurance undertakings shouldn’t be “overly burdensome” and that there would be no material costs for policyholders. “The capital requirements would fully capture the risk of crypto-asset with a positive impact on policyholder protection in case there are material exposures in the future.” Related: Tabit offers USD insurance policies backed by Bitcoin regulatory capital EIOPA acknowledged that the share of crypto-asset (re)insurance undertakings accounts for just 655 million euros or 0.0068% of all undertakings in Europe — even referring to it as “immaterial.” “At the same time crypto assets are high risk investments which may result in total loss of value,” EIOPA said, explaining why it recommends option three. Luxembourg and Sweden could be hit hardest by the proposed rule Insurers in Luxembourg and Sweden are likely to be the most affected, according to a Q4 2023 report cited by EIOPA, which found that these two countries accounted for 69% and 21% of all crypto asset-related exposures among (re)insurance undertakings. Ireland, Denmark and Liechtenstein also accounted for 3.4%, 1.4% and 1.2% of the undertakings. Most of these undertakings are structured within funds, such as exchange-traded funds, and held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders, EIOPA noted.

One minute they’re mooning, the next minute you’re wondering where your investment went. But lately, two coins have been stirring up the crypto scene: Slerf—with its explosive presale saga and ongoing refund frenzy, and Simon’s Cat—dropping a new mobile game and clawing its way up the charts. While both are making noise, there’s one coin quietly locking down the throne with cold-hard numbers among the top new meme coins to join today: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Let’s be real—presales are the crypto investor’s haven. No wild price swings, no rug-pull panic, and most importantly, massive upside potential. And BTFD isn’t just riding the wave—it’s building the damn ocean. From a fully functional P2E game and 90% staking APY to the unmatched community power of the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin is lighting up presale charts and making early buyers feel like they’ve struck digital gold. Want in? Keep reading—because these are the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Can the Bulls Squad Deliver 2900% ROI and 100% Bonus? What happens when you take a market meme like “ Buy The Dip ” and turn it into a full-blown movement? You get BTFD Coin—a presale powerhouse backed by a die-hard community called the Bulls Squad. These aren’t just token holders; they’re a movement. Led by mascots like Baby Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Raging Bull, this squad’s mission is simple: stack dips, ride the next bull run, and laugh all the way to the bank. Now in its 15th stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.0002. And with one final stage to go, time is ticking. Over 72 billion coins have already been sold, with $6.42 million raised and more than 11,600 wallet holders. The listing price? $0.0006. That’s a clean 200% ROI just for showing up early. But the real kicker? Analysts believe $BTFD could reach a moon price of $0.006—a jaw-dropping 2900% return from today’s presale level. Let’s run some numbers: if you throw $1500 into the current presale price ($0.0002), you get 7.5 million BTFD tokens. Apply the LAUNCH100 code and you’ll get double that—15 million tokens. If BTFD hits $0.0006, that’s $9,000. And if it reaches the projected moonshot of $0.006, you’re looking at $90,000. All from a $1500 play. Wild, right? Hey Bulls, major announcement your way: BTFD is offering a one-time 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100). Buy now in Stage 15 and your tokens will be DOUBLED. That’s twice the gains. But here’s the twist—this offer disappears after March 30. So if you’ve ever wanted to flex on your crypto group chat, now’s your shot with the top new meme coin to join today. This isn’t just about buying low—it’s about staking smart too. With meme coin presale staking at 90% APY, BTFD Coin lets you double dip: get coins, stake them, and earn even more while chilling with the Bulls.

You’re not alone. With meme coins turning ordinary folks into overnight legends—and then flipping the table the next day—it’s hard to separate diamond plays from digital dust. But this time, it’s different. A bold new crop of meme coins is rising, and the math isn’t just promising—it’s absurdly juicy. Especially with one presale so hot, it’s practically sizzling among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Let’s talk facts. Meme coin markets are exploding again. Bitcoin just brushed against $85,000, ETH’s rally turned heads, and altcoin whispers are turning into roars. But what’s cooking underneath? Meme coins are staging a comeback—with smarter mechanics, stronger communities, and real-world features. And frontlining this surge is BTFD Coin, smashing presale records, building a buzzing Bulls Squad, and dangling a limited 100% bonus offer that’s shaking up Telegram chats like never before. One of the best parts? The LAUNCH100 code that doubles your bag ends March 30, 2025. Miss that, and well… you’ll be watching others moon while you refresh CoinMarketCap with regret. Want in? You better keep reading. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Get 2x Coins, 90% APY Staking, and a Moonshot to $0.006! What if one meme coin presale could triple your returns before it even hits exchanges? That’s not clickbait—it’s BTFD Coin in its final stretch. It’s currently in Stage 15 of its presale, priced at just $0.0002, and there’s only one stage left before it lists at $0.0006. That alone offers a 200% return, but the real gold lies ahead. Let’s play with numbers: invest $4,000 today at $0.0002, and you’ll bag 20 million BTFD coins. Apply the LAUNCH100 code before March 30, and boom—you’re now holding 40 million coins. If BTFD reaches its predicted moonshot of $0.006, that turns into $240,000. That’s a staggering 2900% ROI. Yes, you read that right. And there’s more. BTFD offers staking at 90% APY—yes, 90%! That’s not some locked-away dream; it’s live, and early investors are already compounding their gains. Stake now, and by next year, your BTFD bag could multiply even further—without lifting a finger. The Bulls Squad community is buzzing, the P2E game is fully live, and players are already earning BTFD rewards as they dive through challenges with Baby Bull, Raging Bull, and the rest of the herd. Combine that with the Ethereum-based smart contract, a fixed supply, and token burns on the way—it’s no surprise experts are calling BTFD one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term. This One’s For You — Don’t Miss the 100% Bonus! Right now, BTFD is dropping a bombshell: every token you buy with the code LAUNCH100 will be doubled. This isn’t a drill. This limited BOGO-style deal vanishes on March 30, and it’s the last chance before the presale ends. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus: First, head to the BTFD Presale . Click “Connect Wallet” (MetaMask or Trust Wallet work fine). When you see the bonus field, type in LAUNCH100 (all caps), hit “Apply,” and approve it in your wallet. Now input your purchase amount, click “Buy Now,” and lock in your double reward. And don’t sleep on the referral program—if your code lands in the top 20, you’ll earn 10% of every referred purchase in $BTFD. That’s passive income done right. So why did BTFD make this list? Because it’s got the ingredients meme coin legends are made of: strong utility, viral branding, real community, and ridiculous upside. 2. COQ Inu (COQ) – Avalanche’s Wildest Ride Yet Ever seen a rooster run faster than a cheetah? That’s COQ Inu on the Avalanche chain. Born from memes and driven by raw community power, COQ has become the feathered face of Avalanche’s meme ecosystem. This isn’t just some barnyard banter—it’s pushing volume charts and attracting new traders by the thousands. Its charm lies in simplicity. COQ’s community controls everything, with token burns, liquidity locks, and meme campaigns giving it wings. It’s also taken full advantage of Avalanche’s low-fee and high-speed perks, giving memecoin traders a smoother ride than ever. COQ Inu earned its spot among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term because it’s proof that a loud, fun-loving crowd can drive serious momentum in the right direction. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – OG Meme King Plotting a Comeback? You thought SHIB was done? Think again. The original “Dogecoin killer” has been quietly preparing its next act—and this time, it’s got some heavy-hitting tools. With the Shibarium upgrade now live, gas fees are lower, speed is up, and SHIB’s ecosystem is growing. ShibaSwap has become a DeFi favorite, and token burns have started picking up again. SHIB’s recent surge in whale activity and retail chatter hints at something brewing under the surface. It’s even showing a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s latest breakout. So why is SHIB still on this list of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term? Because even after all these years, it still finds a way to sneak back into the big leagues—and this cycle could be no different. Final Thoughts – Before This Window Slams Shut… Here’s the truth most won’t tell you: Buying in the hype phase means you’re already late. That’s why presales like BTFD Coin give smart investors the chance to dodge volatility and market manipulation entirely. You’re locking in early—before whales come swimming. Whether you’re here for COQ’s energy, SHIB’s rebirth, or BTFD’s complete staking-to-gaming-to-ROI trifecta, one thing’s clear—this meme coin cycle is unlike any other. But let’s be honest—only one coin in this list is offering you double tokens, passive 90% APY rewards, and a projected 2900% return if it hits $0.006. That’s BTFD. And this opportunity doesn’t wait. So if you’re looking for the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term, you’ve just found the ones worth betting on. But don’t just watch from the sidelines. Join the BTFD Coin presale before the LAUNCH100 bonus disappears and you’re left wondering, “Why didn’t I just click buy?” Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What is the best way to buy BTFD Coin with the LAUNCH100 bonus?

ETH is now consolidating and remains at risk of a downside break. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $2,050 resistance level. The price is trading below $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,040 and $2,100 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and corrected some gains, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,040 and $2,020 support levels. It tested the $1,980 zone. A low was formed at $1,982 and the price recently attempted a fresh upward move. There was a move above the $2,020 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,098 swing high to the $1,982 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,040 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,050 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,098 swing high to the $1,982 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,095 level. A clear move above the $2,095 resistance might send the price toward the $2,150 resistance. An upside break above the $2,150 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,250 resistance zone or even $2,320 in the near term. Downside Break In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,040 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,000 level. The first major support sits near the $1,980 zone. A clear move below the $1,980 support might push the price toward the $1,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,820 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,750.

XRP has shown strong upward momentum, decisively breaking through key long-term resistance levels, while positive chart patterns appear to be forming. This technical picture, combined with favorable regulatory shifts and signs of growing institutional interest, contributes to the increasingly bullish sentiment.

Despite Ethereum’s sluggish price action, multiple on-chain indicators and technical patterns hint at an impending bullish reversal. Ethereum Retail Sentiment At Low Amid Sluggish Price Action According to cryptocurrency analyst Mister Crypto, retail interest in ETH is “extremely low,” as indicated by Google Trends data. Compared to its 2017 and 2021 peaks, Ethereum’s current sentiment ranks significantly lower, suggesting that many retail investors are sitting on the sidelines. Historically, low retail sentiment often signals a prime buying opportunity for institutional investors looking to accumulate assets before the next price surge. While weak sentiment reflects a lack of confidence among small investors, institutions tend to take advantage of such conditions, positioning themselves ahead of the next bullish cycle. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Breaking Free from the Bear Trap? Analysts Weigh In Despite the pessimism, crypto analyst Ted pointed out that the potential approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) staking and the upcoming Pectra update could serve as key catalysts for a breakout. He suggests that these developments may help Ethereum regain momentum and push its price toward new highs. Fellow analyst Crypto Patel echoed this sentiment, noting that ETH is currently consolidating within an accumulation range. Based on historical price cycles and on-chain data, Patel expects Ethereum to break out after April, with a long-term target of $10,000. Additionally, analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted a bullish crossover on Ethereum’s weekly Stochastic RSI, a signal that has historically marked market bottoms. He suggests that ETH may be nearing the end of its bearish cycle, setting the stage for a strong rally. Further Pain For ETH? Sharing a contrasting viewpoint, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized that there has been “no change in the outlook for Ethereum.” The analyst hinted that ETH is still likely to hit the lower-end of its current price range at $1,300. However, some on-chain indicators suggest Ethereum may already be undervalued. An analysis using the Market Value to Realized Value Z-score (MVRV-Z) indicates that ETH is trading at levels historically associated with price rebounds. This metric, which compares Ethereum’s market value to its realized value, suggests that ETH might be primed for accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashing Bullish Signals, But Rising Exchange Reserves Raise Concerns – Details For Ethereum to confirm a bullish reversal, it must break through strong resistance at $2,300. A successful breakout could push ETH toward $3,000 in the short term. Failure to surpass this level, however, might result in extended consolidation or another price decline. At press time, ETH trades at $2,007, down 0.5% in the last 24 hours.

But before that, he is clearing the mess created under Biden and Gary Gensler. This follows similar cases of drop against Coinbase, Kraken, and Ripple. Being one of the compliant exchanges in the industry, Crypto.com has not bowed down to the SEC’s manipulative act and fights back to snatch this victory. The SEC’s investigation into https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR has been closed with no action being taken against https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR . — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) March 27, 2025 This comes after the SEC issued a Wells notice to Crypto.com in October 2024, signaling a possible lawsuit. In response, the exchange fought back by suing the agency for overstepping its authority. However, in December, Crypto.com withdrew its lawsuit after President Donald Trump announced his intention to appoint pro-crypto figure Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair. Crypto.com’s Response Crypto.com’s legal troubles with the SEC began when regulators cracked down on multiple crypto firms. Unlike other exchanges that faced lawsuits or settlements, Crypto.com stood its ground, arguing that the SEC was unfairly targeting the industry. Nick Lundgren, the company’s Chief Legal Officer, called the investigation unnecessary and praised the decision to close it. He criticized the previous SEC leadership for its aggressive stance against crypto, saying it forced the industry into legal battles rather than providing clear regulations. With this case closed, Crypto.com remains one of the few global crypto exchanges that have avoided penalties or legal action from U.S. regulators. Crypto.com’s Compliance Record Stands Strong Throughout its legal fight, Crypto.com has maintained a strong compliance track record. The exchange has secured over 100 regulatory approvals worldwide and continues to operate within strict financial guidelines. This includes approvals from U.S. financial watchdogs, making it one of the most regulated platforms in the industry. With the SEC case behind it, Crypto.com is now focused on working with regulators to shape fairer policies for the crypto industry.

Ripple, which faced accusations from the SEC regarding its sale of XRP tokens, has now emerged victorious, as the judge ruled in favor of Ripple multiple times. The SEC’s decision to appeal earlier this year in January, even after the resignation of former chairman Gary Gensler, frustrated many, including Ripple. However, with the dismissal of the appeal, the legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple has now officially ended. Following the dismissal of the appeal, excitement surged in the crypto market, with XRP’s value experiencing a notable uptick. Despite this positive development for Ripple, enthusiasts are still awaiting a formal confirmation from the SEC. As of March 28, 2025, the SEC has officially announced the dismissal of litigation against several other companies, including Kraken, ConsenSys, and Cumberland, but has not yet made a statement on the Ripple case. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the SEC’s current focus is on addressing the procedural requirements for lifting the standard injunction imposed by Judge Torres, which has delayed the official end to the case. No @Ripple here but I’m not entirely surprised because, again, it is slightly different to these other cases in that (as @s_alderoty mentioned in his post) the SEC now has to go to the Southern District and ask Judge Torres to lift the standard injunction. Once that is done, they… https://t.co/KVjCsR6l2V — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 27, 2025 Attorney Fred Rispoli said that with the recent announcements, the paperwork for lifting the injunction is already being prepared. A vote by the SEC Commission is expected in less than 30 days. Once that happens, Ripple will not oppose the motion to lift the injunction, and Judge Torres will likely sign off on it. All of this means that within 60 days, Ripple’s legal battles with the SEC could be fully and formally resolved. For now, the crypto community remains on edge, awaiting the final formalities to conclude.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|XRP|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 03:57:03

Popcat and Mog Coin have each made a splash with viral growth and big early gains, mostly fueled by humor and internet trends. Popcat leaned into the love for a classic meme, while Mog Coin tapped into the internet’s cat craze to build its momentum. But then there’s Dragoin ($DDGN) —a project with a twist. It offers more than just laughs or quick flips. Dragoin is shaping a full-on fantasy world where the presale is part of a bigger journey. It’s not just about buying a coin—it’s about being part of a growing legend. Popcat (POPCAT): Riding the Meme Wave to Big Returns Popcat (POPCAT) launched in late 2023 on Solana, and it wasted no time going viral. Based on the well-known “Pop Cat” meme, it skipped the usual presale, giving everyone an equal shot from day one. Solana’s fast, low-cost network helped the token take off quickly. The result? A massive 23,300% surge from launch to its peak in early 2024. As of March 24, 2025, POPCAT is trading at $0.2323, up 10.6% in the last 24 hours and 16.5% over the week. That’s still 88.7% down from its high, but early buyers remain well in the green. With nearly 980 million tokens in circulation and a $226 million market cap, Popcat is still going strong on Solana. It’s proof that humor, speed, and community can still go a long way in the meme coin space. Mog Coin (MOG): No Presale, Just Pure Community Power Mog Coin (MOG) made its debut in July 2023 on Ethereum. No presale, no venture funding—just memes and a loyal community. What started as a cat-themed token built real traction through word of mouth. That momentum eventually earned MOG a place on Coinbase’s roadmap and helped push the price to a high of $0.000004022 in December 2024. Fast forward to March 24, 2025: MOG is trading at $0.00000054, up 15.05% in 24 hours and 12.63% over the week. That’s still 86.6% below its top, but it’s up an incredible 11,807.2% since its 2023 low. With a $209 million market cap and more than 390 trillion tokens in circulation, MOG has proven that community energy and a good meme can still deliver big results—even without a big budget. Dragoin’s Presale Feels Like a Fantasy—and It Comes with Real Potential Dragoin ($DDGN) isn’t just here to join the meme coin race—it’s adding a new layer to it. The project is rolling out a 25-stage presale, and each one is named after major fantasy events, taking inspiration from series like Game of Thrones. But it’s not just clever names—each stage brings its own rewards and unique ways to engage. It all starts with Stage 1, “The Fall of Valyria.” Beyond the name, it’s Dragoin’s most affordable entry point. Like the fall of an empire in fiction, this moment marks the beginning of Dragoin’s rise. For early buyers, it’s a chance to grab tokens before the price moves up with each new round. More than anything, Dragoin is inviting people to be part of the journey. It’s not just about holding tokens—it’s about joining a community that grows stage by stage. As the presale continues, so do the rewards and engagement. The longer you stay in, the more involved you become. Why Dragoin Might Offer Something More Meaningful Popcat and Mog Coin have both shown how far a meme and an active crowd can go. They delivered big for early investors and sparked strong online support. They’ve also proven that even in a sea of tokens, a fun idea and good timing can still win. But Dragoin ($DDGN) is offering a different route. With a presale that doubles as a storyline, play-to-earn potential, and a focus on decentralization, it aims to do more than entertain. It wants to build something lasting. Every phase of the presale is a step in an unfolding tale—and that makes the investment feel like more than just a trade. For those thinking beyond short-term gains, Dragoin could be where the real story begins.

Every week brings fresh momentum for select coins, sparking interest among smart market watchers. These aren’t just rising in value—they’re also showing signs of strong future growth. For anyone tracking the next big move, now is the time to dig deeper into a few standout names. Among the best-performing cryptos are BlockDAG, Polkadot, Near Protocol, and XRP. These names are gaining traction for both daily trading and long-term potential. With active communities and steady development, they’re attracting attention in today’s market. Here’s a closer look at why they could be key players in 2025. BlockDAG (BDAG): Fast Transactions Speed and Huge ROI Potential BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly earning a spot among the best-performing cryptos in 2025. Known for its high speed and ability to scale, BlockDAG can support large DeFi platforms and handle heavy transaction loads without issues. It also places strong focus on safety, using advanced cryptography to protect data and block harmful actions. With this secure and growing system, more people are turning to BlockDAG over other options. The project’s presale has now passed $207 million, with plans to reach $600 million soon. BDAG’s price has jumped from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0248 in batch 27—a 2,380% rise. With its mainnet launch and 10 exchange listings coming up, interest in BDAG coins is likely to increase even more. Experts predict BDAG could hit $1 in 2025 and possibly reach $30 by 2030, thanks to its steady presale progress and strong outlook. For those aiming at long-term gains, buying at the current low price might offer one of the best chances to benefit from future growth. Polkadot (DOT): Linking Different Chains in One Place Polkadot focuses on connecting different blockchain systems under one structure. Instead of being separate, chains on Polkadot can share information and tools. This boosts performance across the full network. A key part of its design is the parachain auctions, where new chains compete for limited spots, which raises the project’s quality overall. With more parachains set to go live in 2025, excitement is growing for Polkadot. These updates could support both higher use and price gains. Those looking for value in a busy market may find Polkadot’s approach and expanding reach worth paying attention to. It holds steady among the best-performing cryptos. Near Protocol (NEAR): Quick, Cheap, and Developer-Focused Near Protocol stays relevant due to its fast speed, low costs, and expanding use cases. It handles more users without slowing down, thanks to its special structure called sharding. This makes Near more efficient than others that get clogged up as users increase. Backed by a $100 million fund and more activity from developers, Near could see major gains soon. As more users demand quicker and affordable platforms, Near is well placed to grow. It stands as one of the best-performing cryptos for upcoming growth. Ripple (XRP): Still Active Despite Legal Uncertainty Ripple (XRP) remains among the best-performing cryptos due to its global payments role and ongoing case with the SEC. Even with legal delays, XRP draws attention from both traders and institutions. Ripple’s system is still used by banks and firms for fast money transfers, keeping it relevant. If Ripple gets a good result in court, it could lift XRP’s price and use in a big way. Through all the ups and downs, its place in the money-transfer space gives XRP long-term promise. Best Performing Cryptos in 2025— Final Words! Each of these best-performing cryptos brings something different to the table. Polkadot gives solid cross-chain features, Near Protocol delivers speed and low fees, and XRP is strong in payment use—each has potential for the future. But only one shows signs of much larger returns. BlockDAG has already crossed $207 million in presale funds with over 18.9 billion coins sold. The current price of $0.0248 in batch 27 has experts saying $1 in 2025 is realistic, and even $30 by 2030. These signs make BDAG stand out clearly from the rest of the best-performing cryptos .

According to a Mar. 27 announcement on Circle’s official blog, the demand for stablecoins has been rising despite market volatility. Stablecoins have found a strong product-market fit in both the web3 and traditional finance sectors. However, many companies struggle to set up stablecoin transactions due to technical and compliance hurdles. USDCKit will help remove these barriers by providing large-scale payment processing, automated fund transfers, and integrated regulatory tools. Any business that handles large amounts of USD Coin ( USDC ) transactions could benefit, even though payment service providers and remittance platforms will probably be the first users. USDCKit will also facilitate the smooth transfer of USDC between networks by supporting several blockchains, such as Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ).

GameStop (GME) short sales volume — the total number of shares sold short within a specific timeframe — rose 234% over 24 hours, reaching 30.85 million shares sold on March 27, according to TradingView data. The SSR kicks in when a stock drops over 10% from the previous day’s closing price. GameStop’s stock fell 22% over the trading day, wiping out its 12% gain from the Bitcoin announcement and then some, according to Google Finance data. At the time of publication, GME was trading at $22.09. GameStop shorts volume near 2021 short squeeze levels The rule is applied for the rest of the trading day and the following trading day. Malone Wealth president and CEO Kevin Malone said in a March 27 X post that “GameStop traded 50x more shares today than last Thursday. Not statistically possible without naked short-selling.” GameStop’s short sale volume reached 30.88 million on March 27. Source: TradingView The number is close to the levels reached in January 2021 when GameStop stocks famously went meteoric after a “short squeeze” of the stock, causing significant losses for hedge funds and other short sellers while some retail traders made significant returns. The highest point reached during that month was 33.26 million shares on Jan. 19. GameStop Bitcoin buy is “dot-comish” GameStop did not specify how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase, but after the markets closed on March 26, the firm announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering . However, some analysts and commentators have questioned GameStop’s plan to start purchasing Bitcoin. Speaking to Yahoo Finance on March 27, Tastylive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff said that GameStop's decision to buy Bitcoin feels “a little dot-comish” to him. Source: Hans Akamatsu “It feels a little like, oh, I’m going to throw a dot com at the end of my name, I’m going to buy some Bitcoin with our excess cash because we can’t find a company that is going to be accretive,” Sosnoff said. Meanwhile, Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro , told Reuters on March 27 that “investors are not necessarily optimistic on the underlying business.” Biggest day of short sales still goes to Keith Gill’s return The biggest day of short sales still belongs to June 3, 2024, when it reached 46.20 million. This was around the time Keith Gill, a stock trader known for the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, revealed on June 2 that he had started trading GameStop stock again, this time with $180 million to play with. Related: Firms without business models ‘buy Bitcoin’ — Angel investor Jason Calacanis GameStop said the convertible senior notes — debt that can later be converted into equity — will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquiring Bitcoin. Some analysts see the convertible notes offering announcement as the reason for the stock’s decline. Han Akamatsu said in a March 27 X post that GameStop’s stock is dropping for the same reason Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) declined after issuing convertible notes. “In 2021, MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes, the stock dipped after the announcement due to hedging shorts, but later exploded when Bitcoin ripped and the arbitrage unspooled,” Akamatsu said, adding: “GME is following the same blueprint now ...If GME or BTC goes up a lot, the trade gets very interesting as we have a squeeze opportunity here.” Magazine: Arbitrum co-founder skeptical of move to based and native rollups: Steven Goldfeder This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The price is now showing a few bearish signs and might decline below the $2.30 level. XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.420 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.35 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it breaks the $2.30 support zone. XRP Price Extends Losses XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.420 resistance zone and reacted to the downside, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.40 and $2.35 levels. The pair even tested the $2.30 zone. A low was formed at $2.301 and the price is now consolidating losses. The current price action is bearish below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.478 swing high to the $2.301 low. The price is now trading below $2.38 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.35 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.35 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.3850 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.478 swing high to the $2.301 low. The next resistance is $2.420. A clear move above the $2.420 resistance might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance or even $2.550 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.620. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.30 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.050 zone.
