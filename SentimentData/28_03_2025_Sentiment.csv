The cryptocurrency with a total value of $201,400 was traced to fundraising addresses allegedly controlled by Hamas and used to launder more than $1.5 million in digital assets since October 2024. The laundering occurred through a series of “virtual currency exchanges and transactions by leveraging suspected financiers and over-the-counter brokers,” the DOJ said. The funds are currently held in a combination of at least 17 wallets. Affidavit to seize the Hamas-linked cryptocurrency. Source: US DOJ In January 2024, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, along with corresponding organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia, announced sanctions against networks and facilitators of crypto transactions linked to Hamas. Those sanctions were built on US Treasury sanctions from October 2023. In January 2024, three families of victims of the Hamas attack against Israel sued Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao , alleging that the exchange had provided “substantial assistance” to terrorists. In oral arguments, a lawyer representing Binance claimed the exchange had “no special relationship [with] Hamas .” Binance has faced scrutiny from the US government over alleged shortcomings in its Anti-Money Laundering controls. The exchange settled with the DOJ for $4.3 billion in November 2023. More regulation needed? According to a December 2024 report by the Congressional Research Service, Hamas has allegedly sought cryptocurrency donations since at least 2019, although the “scale and effectiveness” of these efforts have been unclear. Terrorist organizations using crypto for fundraising have increasingly drawn the attention of the US, with some officials questioning whether the industry needed more supervision or regulation to stop such behavior. According to a 2023 Chainalysis report, terrorism financing accounts for a very small amount of crypto usage, with illegal groups sticking to using traditional, fiat-based methods to fund operations.

This time, the spotlight was on Token2049, a prominent cryptocurrency event that is expected to attract major industry players in three separate events later this year. The alert warned members of the group to be wary of sponsors as the event approaches because conveners typically do very little due diligence on these supporters. “Just because someone is a title or platinum sponsor does not mean they are credible,” Zach wrote. Zach blow s wh istle about shady and sketchy Token2049 sponsors The report listed Spacecoin as the title sponsor of the upcoming event, but according to Zach, it is a “botted project.” Connect with @_spacecoin , Title Sponsor of #TOKEN2049 Dubai! Spacecoin is the world’s first DePIN powered by satellites, building trustless, decentralized internet connectivity on a global scale. Learn more: https://t.co/ove4Sodour pic.twitter.com/n6DMQ1rZgm — TOKEN2049 (@token2049) March 20, 2025 A quick look at Spacecoin’s page revea ls i t is aiming to be the world’s first DePIN project that is powered by satellites. It claims its “decentralized satellite constellation provides global 5G internet access to the 2.9 billion people who remain unconnected” and has lofty ambitions of connecting the world via its satellites. The term “botted” can be interpreted in a number of ways in crypto, but none is flattering. On the bright side, its name appears alongside platforms like OKX, BloFin, MEXC, KuCoi n and Binance as “title sponsors. ” The on-chain sleuth also tagged Bitunix, JuCoin, WEEX, and DWF, which Token2049 lists as platinum sponsors as “sketchy. ” Zach pointed out in his report that the teams he mentioned are the ones on his radar for now. However, he expects the list to grow longer before the first event starts in April. For the centralized exchanges that made the “sketchy” list, Zach said he checked to verify if the team is public and has a prior work history in the space. The listed platform s including Bitunix, JuCoin, & WEE X all failed this test. Bitunix, which Zach described as a “sketchy exchange,” is an actual cryptocurrency exchange registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and it offers spot and futures trading. Some days ago , a report revealed that Bitunix is being targeted by South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) for providing services to Korean customers without proper registration. The crypto platform reportedly operates Korean-language websites and provides market and customer support activities targeted to Korean investors without notifying authorities or filing for a VASP license. JuCoin, also tagged “sketchy” by Zach, is another exchange, previously known as Jubi. It may have gotten on Zach’s radar because it has a history of ownership changes, rebrand s and regulatory pivots. Ironically, the exchange announced that it had applied for its VASP license to operate in Taiwan, stating that it “is taking the lead in Taiwan’s compliance process by officially applying for regulatory licenses, implementing KYC systems. ” Another eyebrow-raiser may be that JuCoin is not regulated in the US, EU, or other major markets with strict regulatory standards, except for an exemption from Singapore’s Monetary Authority. WEEX, another sketch y company according to Zach , is a crypto futures exchange established in 2018 and registered in Singapore. The doubts about the exchange are because it is not regulated by a financial authority with strict standards. There have also been social media posts complaining of weird behavior on the exchange, such as frozen accounts and unwarranted KYC issues. DWF, tagged as a “sketchy market maker,” is a known Web3 investor and market maker, trading on over 60 exchanges and involved in high-profile investments. It may have been included on Zach’s list because of past accusations of wash trading as a market maker and the more recent rug allegation from Vite Labs. Vite Labs made the rug allegation hours ago today, March 27, 2025. The allegation was shared on the project’s X page and claimed that “the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. ” “We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled,” the post from Vite Labs concluded . Hi guys we want to update that the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled. — Vite Labs 🏃🏻‍♂️ (@vitelabs) March 27, 2025 In the comments section of the post, people demanded more information on how DWF Labs may have rugged the fund s, but Vite Labs did not provide any further explanation. As for Binance, it claimed that it delisted Vite Labs’ token because it no longer met certain requirements. The wash trading allegation linked to DWF Labs came in May 2024. It accused the market maker of conducting over $300 million in wash trades across seven tokens in 2023, manipulating the price of Yield Guild Games’ native token , Y GG and other cryptocurrencies. Binance refuted the allegations, claiming that the transactions were proprietary and were free o f manipulati on while accusing the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors, leading to his termination. Binance has affirmed its strict market surveillance program and commitment to combating market abuse. The exchange has said that it does not tolerate manipulation practices and has dismissed nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of over $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past couple of years. The danger of sketchy platforms posing as sponsor s A sketch y character sponsoring an event, brand, or politician happe ns in all spheres of life, including crypto. It does not happen often at the Token204 9 eve nt but a case was recorded not too long ag o whi ch had disastrous consequences . Za ch in hi s repo rt highlighted one incident from late 2023 when a sketchy exchange known as JPEX was chosen as a platinum sponsor for that year’s Token 2049 conference. The team was flagged by the Hong Kong government during the conference as an unlicensed company with allegedly “suspiciou s features .” After victims made abou t 14 00 reports to law enforcement, about 70 people were arrested by the police in connection with the HK$1.6 billion JPEX cryptocurrenc y scand al and nearly HK$230 million (US$29.37 million) in assets were immediately frozen. The scandal was tagged Hong Kong’s biggest case of alleged financial fraud. Despite all the heat, the platform remained defiant, hitting users with an exorbitant fee for virtual asset withdrawals. Police Commissioner Raymond Siu Chak-yee later revea led the number of arrests related to the case had shot up t o 72 and about HK$228 million had been frozen. “The force has received 2,636 reports with regard to the case as of today, and the amount involved is about HK$1.6 billion,” he said. Among those previously arrested were social media influencers who had appeared in adverts for the trading platform and set up their own over-the-counter shops. These included Chan Wing-yee, Joseph La m Ch ok and Sheena Leung. We're thrilled to be partnering for TOKEN2049, a key crypto event!

Another example of a crypto project that employed this tactic is Centra Tech, a fraudulent crypto project that leveraged celebrity endorsements and event appearances to gain credibility. With its antics, it secured $32 million in funding through an ICO, claiming to offer a debit card for crypto payments. Those behind it went as far as talking about it at events, touting fake partnerships with Visa and Mastercard. The SEC charged them with fraud in 2018, and co-founder Sohrab Sharma was sentenced to eight years in prison. An even more popular example is the FTX saga. FTX, now a bankrupt exchange, used its significant political influence, which it got by sponsoring politicians, to enhance its reputation. Its form er CEO S am Bankman-Fr ied would donate millions to political campaigns in the US, including $1 million to a McConnell-aligned super PAC days before FTX’s 2022 collapse. The purpose of the spending was to keep FTX on the favorable side of regulation, but in the end, FTX was exposed for misappropriating $10 billion in customer funds, leading to Bankman-Fried’s conviction in 2023.

New processes reduce friction and simplify crypto transactions. Enhanced security and clear rules boost user confidence. This approach may widen access in underserved areas. Although Bitcoin (BTC) has long been perceived as a store of value, analysts in 2024 predicted that its next major use case could emerge in the form of payments, driven by shifting regulations and increasing infrastructure support. According to EMARKETER , crypto payment adoption was expected to grow by 82.1% over two years beginning in 2024, supported by friendlier regulations and expanding payment provider networks . Source: EMARKETER A Bitget Wallet report also highlighted security concerns as the biggest barrier to crypto payment adoption. What’s driving crypto payment adoption and what’s holding it back? We surveyed 4,599 users to uncover key trends shaping the future of PayFi Here’s the key findings from our 2025 PayFi Report! pic.twitter.com/yycmW7OcWO — Bitget Wallet (@BitgetWallet) March 25, 2025 The report, which surveyed 4,599 users, found that over 37% of respondents considered security risks the main obstacle to using cryptocurrency for payments. Other concerns included irreversible transactions and a lack of legal protection. Source: Bitget Wallet Simplifying Crypto Payments With Traditional Platforms In response to ongoing security and usability issues, some platforms have started to streamline the crypto payment process to encourage broader usage. Bakhrom Saydulloev, a product lead at payments infrastructure firm Mercuryo , told Cryptonews that crypto payments had shown consistent growth despite wider market fluctuations. “The data supports this outlook, as Mercuryo is observing steady growth in payment volumes across our ecosystem despite broader market fluctuations,” said Saydulloev. Saydulloev noted that user experience remains a major hurdle. “Many products remain unnecessarily complex, fostering friction at every step from account opening to completing transactions,” he remarked. “Beyond these issues, users simply want what they expect from any payment system: low costs, speed, and safety.” Saydulloev noted that Mercuryo had begun integrating traditional payment methods to address these issues. For example, the company partnered with Revolut Pay, a mainstream online payment platform, to make buying and selling crypto more accessible. “Revolut Pay simplifies buying crypto assets to a single click,” Saydulloev said. “The platform also has reinforced security features, including biometric technology and passcodes that secure the crypto purchasing process for users.” Crypto exchange CEX.IO has also adopted traditional methods to simplify crypto transactions. Alexander Kerya, vice president of product management at CEX.IO, said the platform recently integrated with MoneyGram to support cash-in and cash-out services for USDC. “This integration facilitates crypto cash-in and cash-out services, enabling seamless conversion of Circle’s USDC stablecoin into physical cash and vice versa,” Kerya said. Kerya added that he believes the growing collaboration between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto services is gradually blurring the lines between these two industries. Regulatory Support for Crypto Payment Adoption These platform efforts coincide with evolving regulatory frameworks that support safer adoption. Bitget Wallet’s report shows that 27% of investors are worried about the lack of legal protection. This signals the need for better safeguards and regulatory clarity around crypto payments. Saydulloev highlighted regulatory progress in the EU and UK. Frameworks such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) now allow credit institutions to issue crypto assets under their existing banking licenses. “Rather than hindering innovation, these regulations create essential trust by establishing consistent rules and protections, which are prerequisites for wider adoption,” Saydulloev commented. Coinbase has also focused on easing friction around crypto payments, particularly stablecoins. A company spokesperson noted that free USDC transfers and fiat onramps make it easier for users to send and receive crypto. Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base, also allows near-instant crypto transactions with very low fees. Statistics from CoinGate , a payment platform, show that stablecoins are becoming a preferred method for crypto payments. In 2024, stablecoins accounted for 35.5% of transactions on the platform, with USDT making up 97.2% of those, followed by USDC at 2.5% and DAI at 0.3%. Global Demand for Faster, Accessible Crypto Payments While adoption in developed regions remains gradual, crypto payments are gaining traction in emerging markets with limited banking access. Bitget Wallet’s data showed that 46% of users prefer crypto payments over fiat due to speed and efficiency. Interest was particularly strong in Africa and Southeast Asia, where 52% and 51% of respondents, respectively, expressed interest in using crypto for payments. Rich Rine, an initial contributor at Core DAO, told Cryptonews that in developing regions, crypto is more than just an alternative—it’s often the first access to financial infrastructure. “In regions with large unbanked or underbanked populations, crypto payments are a 0 to 1 leap in trust and access,” Rine said. “It’s not about replacing a legacy system; it’s about gaining access to a system in the first place.” Rine added that for adoption to grow in the US and Europe, payment solutions must compete with existing systems that offer fraud protection and chargebacks. “This likely requires clearer regulatory frameworks – especially around stablecoins – and tighter integration between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi) ,” he said. For example, he suggested that banks could offer fraud protection and chargeback services on top of stablecoin rails, helping users benefit from fast infrastructure without sacrificing security. Beyond security and infrastructure, financial incentives may also shape the future of crypto-based transactions. “This adds complexity, but also introduces the idea that payments themselves could become productive, not just functional,” he said. Building Trust and Access The drive to simplify crypto payments speaks to a deeper call for secure and inclusive financial services. Traditional banks and digital providers now work side by side to build systems that users can rely on. Their combined focus on safety and usability has the power to expand access for those left behind by older models. This collaboration opens new doors for trust and participation in financial affairs. Think about how this blend of old and new might expand opportunities for you and your community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will combining traditional banking with crypto payments alter consumer use? Integrating established banking methods with digital assets offers a smoother transaction experience. This approach combines secure, familiar processes with quicker crypto transfers, lowering hurdles for daily payments. What benefits can merchants and users expect from a streamlined crypto process? A streamlined process reduces transaction friction for both merchants and consumers. By integrating secure, known banking practices, it provides faster service and ease of use, promoting smoother digital trade. How can regulators and industry leaders work together to build trust in simplified crypto payments? Regulators and industry players must establish clear, consistent rules that merge secure traditional practices with modern digital tools. This cooperative effort fosters trust and promotes broader user confidence.

However, a new type of digital fund, yield-bearing stablecoins , is gaining traction in the industry. These tokens offer interest to investors, similar to how savings accounts in traditional banks work. JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, believe yield-bearing stablecoins could grow massively in the coming years. Currently, these stablecoins make up just 6% of the stablecoin market. Panigirtzoglou suggests they could grow to 50% if regulatory hurdles do not slow them down. Why More Investors Are Choosing Yield-Bearing Stablecoins JPMorgan analysts say more people choose yield-bearing stablecoins because they offer interest without risk. Panigirtzoglou explained that investors do not need to trade or lend money; just holding these treasury funds is enough. These stablecoins have grown fast in recent months. Since the U.S. election in November 2024, the top five treasury-backed assets have increased in value. This includes Ethena’s USDe, Sky Dollar’s USDS, BlackRock’s BUIDL, Usual Protocol’s USD0, and Ondo Finance’s USDY. Their market cap has jumped from $4 billion to over $13 billion. As traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) platform yields have dropped, more investors are turning to them. Crypto trading platforms now accept tokenized U.S. Treasurys as collateral, making earning interest while holding assets easier. Additionally, well-known crypto projects like Frax Finance are now using these stablecoins, which is pushing the trend further. The SEC’s Approval Could Open the Door for More Growth Despite their fast growth, yield-bearing stablecoins still face challenges. They are classified as securities, which creates legal issues and limits their use, especially for everyday investors. However, things might be changing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved a new yield-bearing tokens called YLDS, which is registered as a security. This could open the door for more stablecoins like it. Traditional stables, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, do not share their earnings with users because doing so would make them securities. That would bring stricter rules, making them harder to use in crypto transactions. More companies might follow this model with the SEC approving a yield-bearing stablecoin. Will Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Replace Traditional Ones? Unlike traditional stablecoins with a $220 billion market cap, these newer assets have lower liquidity and are not widely used. However, JPMorgan analysts believe these obstacles may fade as more traders and projects adopt them. As more traders and crypto projects use yield-bearing tokens, their liquidity could improve. This could make them widely used as collateral in crypto trading, part of DAO treasuries, or even a way for crypto investment funds to store idle cash.

After a quiet spell, the past week has brought renewed life to the market. Solana’s BONK posted double-digit gains with impressive volume, while Dragoin ($DDGN) captured growing interest with its interactive play-to-earn design. Investors are once again paying attention—not just to hype, but to tokens that offer real engagement and growth potential. BONK and Dragoin are showing they’re not just participating in the trend—they’re shaping it. BONK Posts Big Gains & Surges in Trading Activity BONK, the top meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, has staged a significant comeback. On March 24, 2025, the token gained 14.8% within a single day, bringing its price to $0.00002507. But even more notable was its trading volume, which hit $210 million—one of the highest totals across the entire crypto market that day. This wasn’t just a random bump in interest. BONK’s performance came on the back of new exchange listings, growing developer involvement within Solana, and a fresh wave of social media activity. Analysts also highlight recent token burn announcements and community-led efforts as key drivers. As BONK bounces back from a challenging earlier stretch this year, many now see it as a core part of Solana’s push into DeFi and NFTs. Still, BONK’s rapid movement reflects how quickly meme coins can respond to sudden buzz. A listing or tweet can change everything—but how long that energy lasts remains uncertain. That’s where Dragoin offers a more carefully structured alternative, built for durability. Dragoin Builds a Strong Foundation Around Utility & Engagement While BONK is making headlines, Dragoin ($DDGN) is steadily building a following. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, this Ethereum-based token is focusing on creating a lasting ecosystem. It combines entertainment with real incentives, setting it apart in a crowded field. At the center of Dragoin is a Telegram-based play-to-earn game. Players can hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens along the way. It’s not just for fun—it’s a system that turns participation into value. Users aren’t just buying and holding; they’re actively engaging, competing, and growing the network. Dragoin’s structure is another key to its appeal. It has a 200 billion token supply, with 50% allocated to a presale divided into 25 pricing stages. As each stage progresses, the price increases. Unsold tokens won’t linger—they’ll be permanently burned, increasing scarcity. The remaining tokens support liquidity, rewards, and development, with only 5% locked for the team under a two-year vesting schedule. That level of clarity and planning is still rare among meme projects. Dragoin’s next steps are already mapped out. In Q2 2025, it will roll out the full game, launch staking options, and expand with influencer collaborations. Q3 is set to bring listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, along with more in-game features. While the online buzz is growing fast, the plan behind it is focused on lasting growth—not quick spikes. Meme Coins Are Growing Up—And So Are Their Audiences The strong rise of both BONK and Dragoin signals that meme coins are evolving—and so are the expectations of those investing in them. The market is no longer driven only by names or memes. It’s about utility, community, and what comes next. BONK, already established and widely recognized, is showing how a meme coin can adapt and align with a broader blockchain vision. Its recent trading activity and increased exchange visibility suggest that it’s becoming more than just a cultural relic—it’s taking on a strategic role in Solana’s crypto growth. Dragoin, on the other hand, represents a fresh direction. It’s not leaning on nostalgia. It’s offering a hands-on experience, paired with a token model that encourages long-term engagement. The combination of gaming, decentralization, and deflationary mechanics is striking a chord with a new wave of users who want to do more than just hold. Together, these two projects highlight different paths to success. BONK reflects resilience and evolution. Dragoin, meanwhile, offers innovation and a new kind of interaction. Both are thriving—but each is writing its own unique story in the next chapter of meme coins.

42500579,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144062,1743116442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Major Crypto Seizure: US DoJ Targets Hamas Terrorism Financing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unveiling-crypto-seizure-doj/,"In a significant move highlighting the ongoing battle against illicit finance in the digital age, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced the seizure of approximately $200,000 in cryptocurrency. This crypto seizure targeted a digital wallet allegedly linked to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The operation underscores the increasing scrutiny on cryptocurrency’s role in funding illegal activities and the proactive measures law enforcement agencies are taking to counter it. This incident also brings to the forefront critical questions about the use of digital assets in terrorism financing and the evolving regulatory landscape. What Exactly Happened with this Crypto Seizure? According to the DoJ, the seized cryptocurrency originated from a wallet believed to be controlled by Hamas. While the immediate seizure amounted to $200,000, authorities suspect this wallet was part of a larger network responsible for laundering around $1.5 million in funds for the organization. This operation is not isolated; it’s part of a broader effort by the U.S. government to disrupt and dismantle financial networks supporting terrorist groups. The details released by the DoJ indicate a sophisticated investigation that traced the flow of funds through the blockchain to identify and ultimately seize the assets. This successful crypto seizure is a testament to the growing capabilities of law enforcement in tracking and intercepting illicit cryptocurrency transactions. Why is Hamas Crypto Usage a Concern? The use of cryptocurrency by groups like Hamas raises several red flags. Here’s why this is a significant concern: Anonymity and Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies, by nature, offer a degree of anonymity and operate outside traditional financial systems. This decentralization can be exploited to evade detection and sanctions, making it challenging for authorities to track and control financial flows. Ease of Cross-Border Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are borderless, enabling groups to receive and transfer funds internationally without relying on traditional banking infrastructure. This ease of cross-border movement complicates efforts to monitor and intercept funds intended for illicit purposes, including terrorism financing. Lower Transaction Fees: Compared to traditional banking systems, cryptocurrency transactions often involve lower fees, making them an attractive option for frequent and large-scale money movements, even for activities like terrorism financing. Potential for Fundraising: Cryptocurrencies can be used to solicit donations globally through online platforms and social media. This fundraising mechanism can be particularly effective for groups seeking to operate outside the purview of traditional financial regulations. The recent crypto seizure highlights these vulnerabilities and underscores the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to combat the misuse of digital assets for illegal activities like terrorism financing. The Role of the DOJ in Combating Terrorism Financing The Department of Justice (DOJ) plays a crucial role in the U.S. government’s efforts to combat terrorism financing. Its responsibilities encompass a wide range of activities, including: Area Description Investigation and Prosecution The DoJ investigates and prosecutes individuals and entities involved in financing terrorism. This includes tracing financial flows, identifying facilitators, and bringing legal action against those who provide material support to terrorist organizations. Asset Forfeiture As demonstrated by this crypto seizure, the DoJ utilizes asset forfeiture laws to seize and confiscate assets derived from or used to facilitate terrorism financing. This disrupts the financial resources available to terrorist groups and prevents them from using these funds for further illicit activities. International Cooperation The DoJ works closely with international partners to share information, coordinate investigations, and extradite individuals involved in terrorism financing. This global collaboration is essential to address the transnational nature of terrorist financing networks. Policy and Strategy Development The DoJ contributes to the development of national policies and strategies to counter terrorism financing. This includes working with other government agencies and international bodies to enhance legal frameworks and improve enforcement mechanisms. The successful crypto seizure operation against Hamas is a clear example of the DOJ’s proactive approach and effectiveness in disrupting terrorist financing networks. How Does Crypto Laundering Work and How is it Being Addressed? Crypto laundering, the process of concealing the origin of cryptocurrency obtained illegally, is a growing concern for law enforcement agencies worldwide. The methods employed by criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but so are the tools and techniques to counter them. Here’s a breakdown of how crypto laundering works and the measures being taken to address it: Common Crypto Laundering Techniques: Tumblers and Mixers: These services obscure the transaction history by mixing various cryptocurrency transactions together, making it harder to trace the original source of funds. Privacy Coins: Cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash offer enhanced privacy features, making transactions more difficult to trace compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Layered Transactions: Launderers may use multiple wallets and exchanges, moving funds through a complex web of transactions to obfuscate the money trail. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): DEXs often have less stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements compared to centralized exchanges, providing avenues for laundering funds with reduced scrutiny. Cross-Chain Swaps: Converting cryptocurrencies across different blockchains can also be used to complicate tracing efforts. Addressing Crypto Laundering: Enhanced Regulations: Governments and regulatory bodies are implementing stricter regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, including robust KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. Blockchain Analytics Tools: Sophisticated blockchain analytics tools are being developed and utilized by law enforcement and financial institutions to trace cryptocurrency transactions, identify suspicious patterns, and uncover laundering schemes. International Collaboration: Global cooperation among law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies is crucial for sharing information, coordinating investigations, and establishing international standards to combat crypto laundering. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies and the cryptocurrency industry is essential to develop effective solutions and best practices for preventing and detecting crypto laundering. The seizure of funds from the Hamas wallet underscores the effectiveness of these countermeasures and the ongoing efforts to refine and improve them. The fight against crypto laundering is a continuous process that requires constant adaptation and innovation. What are the Broader Implications of this Hamas Crypto Case? This particular crypto seizure case has broader implications for the cryptocurrency world and beyond: Legitimacy of Crypto Under Scrutiny: Incidents like this, where cryptocurrency is linked to terrorism financing, can fuel skepticism about the legitimacy of digital assets and strengthen calls for stricter regulation. It is crucial for the crypto industry to proactively address these concerns and demonstrate its commitment to compliance and responsible use. Increased Regulatory Pressure: Expect to see increased regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency industry globally. Governments will likely push for more stringent KYC/AML requirements, enhanced transaction monitoring, and greater oversight of crypto exchanges and service providers to prevent illicit activities. Advancements in Crypto Tracing Technology: The success of this crypto seizure will likely spur further investment and innovation in blockchain analytics and crypto tracing technologies. The ability to effectively track and intercept illicit cryptocurrency transactions is becoming increasingly vital for law enforcement and national security. Heightened Awareness of Terrorism Financing Risks: This case serves as a stark reminder of the evolving tactics used by terrorist organizations to finance their operations. It highlights the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation in strategies to counter terrorism financing, particularly in the digital realm. Actionable Insights: What Can Be Learned? For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, this event provides several actionable insights: Prioritize Security and Compliance: For cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, robust security measures and strict adherence to KYC/AML regulations are paramount. Proactive compliance can help prevent the misuse of platforms for illicit activities and build trust with regulators and users. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is constantly evolving. Individuals and businesses need to stay informed about new regulations and adapt their practices accordingly to remain compliant. Support Responsible Crypto Use: The cryptocurrency community has a responsibility to promote the responsible use of digital assets and actively combat illicit activities. This includes supporting initiatives that enhance transparency, improve security, and foster collaboration with law enforcement. Understand the Risks: Users of cryptocurrency should be aware of the potential risks associated with illicit activities and take precautions to protect themselves from scams and involvement in illegal transactions. Conclusion: A Warning Shot for Illicit Crypto Use The U.S. DoJ’s crypto seizure from a Hamas-linked wallet is more than just a confiscation of funds; it’s a powerful statement. It demonstrates the resolve and increasing capability of law enforcement to track and disrupt illicit financial activities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This operation serves as a clear warning to those who seek to exploit digital assets for illegal purposes, including terrorism financing and crypto laundering. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so too will the scrutiny and efforts to ensure its responsible and legitimate use. The future of cryptocurrency hinges on its ability to operate within a framework of transparency, security, and compliance, and this crypto seizure is a significant step in that direction.

Recently, pseudonymous Bitcoin market analyst Plan B ignited a fresh wave of speculation by suggesting that Bitcoin is not just valuable, but profoundly undervalued when stacked against traditional titans like gold and real estate. For those navigating the crypto landscape, Plan B’s insights offer a compelling narrative, hinting at a potentially significant upside for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Let’s dive deep into this intriguing analysis and unpack what it means for the future of digital gold. Is Bitcoin Really Undervalued? Plan B Thinks So Plan B, a well-known figure in the crypto sphere for his stock-to-flow (S2F) model, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his perspective on Bitcoin’s current market position. His core argument is simple yet powerful: Bitcoin’s market capitalization and scarcity metrics point towards a substantial undervaluation relative to gold and real estate. But what exactly does this mean, and how does he arrive at this conclusion? According to Plan B’s analysis, the numbers speak volumes: Bitcoin’s Market Cap: Currently hovering around $2 trillion. Gold’s Market Cap: A staggering $20 trillion. This ten-fold difference in market capitalization is the first red flag for Plan B. He argues that considering Bitcoin’s growing adoption, technological advancements, and its inherent scarcity, this valuation gap is simply too wide. But the comparison doesn’t stop at market cap. Plan B delves into another crucial metric: scarcity. Scarcity Showdown: Bitcoin vs. Gold Scarcity is a fundamental principle driving value in both traditional commodities like gold and digital assets like Bitcoin. Plan B highlights the concept of “stock-to-flow” ratio to illustrate this point. Stock-to-flow essentially measures the relationship between the existing supply of an asset (stock) and the rate at which new supply is produced (flow). A higher stock-to-flow ratio generally indicates greater scarcity and, theoretically, greater value retention over time. Let’s break down the stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin and gold as presented by Plan B: Bitcoin’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Approximately 120 years. Gold’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Around 60 years. Intriguingly, Bitcoin boasts a stock-to-flow ratio twice that of gold. This implies that Bitcoin is inherently scarcer than gold, at least based on this metric. Plan B posits that this superior scarcity should logically translate to a higher, or at least comparable, valuation. The fact that Bitcoin’s market cap is only a fraction of gold’s, despite its greater scarcity, further strengthens his argument for Bitcoin being undervalued . Real Estate Enters the Valuation Equation While gold is a traditional safe-haven asset often compared to Bitcoin, Plan B also brings real estate into the conversation. The global real estate market dwarfs both gold and Bitcoin in terms of total value. Estimates vary, but the global real estate market is often cited as being several times larger than the gold market, easily exceeding $200 trillion. Why include real estate in this comparison? Plan B’s rationale likely stems from the fact that real estate, like gold, is considered a store of value and a hedge against inflation. However, unlike Bitcoin, real estate is not inherently scarce and is significantly less divisible and portable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers digital scarcity, ease of transfer, and global accessibility. Considering the vastness of the real estate market, Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap appears even smaller in perspective. While real estate serves different purposes and has unique utility, the comparison highlights the immense potential upside if Bitcoin continues to gain traction as a global store of value. What Makes Bitcoin Potentially Undervalued? Beyond market cap and stock-to-flow, several factors contribute to the narrative of Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation: Growing Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even nation-states are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This institutional influx brings significant capital and validation to the Bitcoin market. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. This hard cap ensures digital scarcity, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust blockchain technology offer security and censorship resistance, appealing to individuals and entities seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. Network Effects: As more people adopt and use Bitcoin, its network effect strengthens, further enhancing its value and utility. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments like the Lightning Network and Taproot upgrades are improving Bitcoin’s scalability, privacy, and functionality. These factors collectively paint a picture of a maturing asset with strong fundamentals and growing adoption. If Plan B’s analysis is accurate, and Bitcoin is indeed undervalued , then the current price levels could represent a significant buying opportunity for long-term investors. Challenges and Counterarguments to Bitcoin’s Undervaluation While Plan B’s perspective is compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the counterarguments and challenges to the idea that Bitcoin is fundamentally undervalued: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Price swings can be dramatic and unpredictable, deterring some investors and raising concerns about its stability as a store of value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Unfavorable regulations in major economies could negatively impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Competition from Other Cryptocurrencies: The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with new projects and technologies emerging. Bitcoin faces competition from other cryptocurrencies that may offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, or different functionalities. Energy Consumption Concerns: Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is energy-intensive, raising environmental concerns and attracting criticism. While solutions like the Lightning Network and layer-2 scaling aim to address this, it remains a valid concern for some. Market Sentiment and Speculation: Cryptocurrency markets are heavily influenced by market sentiment and speculation. Price movements can be driven by hype and fear, rather than solely by fundamental value. These challenges highlight the inherent risks associated with investing in Bitcoin and underscore the importance of conducting thorough research and understanding the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Undervalued Bitcoin Narrative So, what are the actionable takeaways from Plan B’s analysis and the broader discussion about Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Plan B’s analysis is a valuable perspective, but it’s crucial to conduct your own independent research. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, economics, and market dynamics. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin may present a compelling investment opportunity, diversification is key to managing risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin alongside other asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Its volatility means short-term price fluctuations are inevitable. Focus on the long-term potential and avoid being swayed by short-term market noise. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and it’s essential to manage your risk appropriately. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Undervalued Potential – A Smart Investment? Plan B’s assertion that Bitcoin is undervalued compared to gold and real estate offers a thought-provoking perspective on the current cryptocurrency landscape. By highlighting the market cap disparity and superior stock-to-flow ratio, he presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s untapped potential. While challenges and risks remain, the fundamental arguments for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition – scarcity, decentralization, growing adoption – are undeniable. Whether Bitcoin will ultimately reach the market capitalization levels of gold or real estate remains to be seen, but Plan B’s analysis certainly provides a strong incentive for investors to take a closer look and consider the smart investment opportunity that Bitcoin might represent.

Over the past 30 days, traders have deployed nearly $400 million in short-leveraged positions, preventing XRP from breaking key resistance levels. How will XRP price react in April 2025? Ripple (XRP) Stagnates at $2.35 as Traders Remain Reluctant to Sell Ripple (XRP) has delivered notable gains over the past week, largely driven by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision to drop charges against Ripple. Many market participants expected a sharp correction following the 10% rally on Monday, assuming large investors would trigger a “sell-the-news” event. However, sustained bullish sentiment, coupled with fresh volatility from Trump’s 25% auto tariff announcement, has helped XRP maintain stability. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis | March 27 | Source: Coinmarketcap Market data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Ripple price briefly dipped to $2.30 before rebounding to $2.35 at press time. This intraday recovery suggests strong buying support at current levels. $244 Million XRP Short Leverage Cluster Emerges at $2.60 as Bears Look to Avert $3 Breakout While spot market sentiment has remained optimistic, XRP derivatives data signal stiff resistance clusters that could impede further price gains. Coinglass liquidation data highlights a notable discrepancy between short and long leverage positions. Over the past 30 days, bears have placed $404 million in short-leveraged positions—30% more than the $283 million in active long positions. The most significant concentration of these short positions, totalling $244 million, is clustered around the $2.60 level. Ripple (XRP) 30-day Liquidation Map, March 27 | Coinglass This high volume of short positions at $2.60 may explain why XRP has struggled to breach this resistance level, despite strong fundamental catalysts such as the SEC dropping its case against Ripple. Whenever XRP price approaches $2.60, an influx of sell orders from leveraged short positions forces a retracement, effectively capping bullish momentum. Until short positions are liquidated or bulls muster enough demand to absorb selling pressure, XRP may continue to face strong resistance at $2.60, delaying a potential breakout toward $3. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Struggle as XRP Faces Key Resistance at $2.40, Eyes $2.00 Support XRP price remains under pressure, trading at $2.35, as it struggles to reclaim key resistance levels. The daily chart presents mixed signals, with the 50-day SMA at $2.52 acting as a key barrier to the upside, while support at $2.00 remains a critical level for bulls to defend. The declining MACD histogram suggests waning bullish momentum, as the MACD line flattens near the zero mark. This signals that buying pressure is fading, leaving room for potential downside movement. XRP Price Forecast The Parabolic SAR dots above the current price indicate a bearish trend, reinforcing the likelihood of further selling pressure. Additionally, declining volume confirms the lack of strong bullish conviction. However, if XRP reclaims $2.40 and closes above the 50-day SMA, it could spark renewed bullish momentum, targeting $2.60. Failure to hold above $2.30 could expose XRP to further declines, with bears eyeing the $2.00 psychological level as the next support. A decisive move below $2.00 would confirm a bearish breakdown, opening the door for further losses toward $1.76.

The latest report, titled “Interest Rates, the S&P 500, and Bitcoin: Lessons from the Past and Expectations in 2025,” examines historical market reactions to the Fed’s policy changes and offers important insights for investors navigating the current economic environment. Dot-Com Bubble (2000-2002): Fed rate hikes contributed to the bursting of the tech bubble, causing the S&P 500 to fall by nearly 50% as overvalued companies collapsed. Subprime Crisis (2007-2009): The S&P 500 fell nearly 57% as the Fed raised interest rates to combat inflation and excessive credit, triggering a global financial crisis. COVID-19 Crash and Recovery (2020): The Fed’s emergency rate cuts and liquidity injections initially led to a sharp 35% decline in the S&P 500, followed by a rapid recovery. Bitcoin has been volatile, but has ultimately benefited from the low-interest environment, strengthening its appeal as an alternative asset. Current Cycle (2022-2025): Divergence in Market Behavior Since 2022, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates from near-zero to 5.5% to counter post-pandemic inflation. Unlike previous crises, the S&P 500 has remained resilient, reaching new highs in 2024-2025. Alphractal attributes this to the following reasons: Lower corporate leverage compared to 2008. Strong performance from AI and technology giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft. Expectations of gradual interest rate cuts are fueling investor optimism. However, the divergence between interest rates and stock market performance is a major concern, according to the analyst firm. Historically, such a breakout has been preceded by high volatility. Bitcoin's historical performance reveals a strong correlation with liquidity conditions: 2010-2021 (Low Interest Rate Era): Bitcoin rose from mere cents to $69,000 in 2021. 2022 Rate Hikes: BTC experienced a sharp correction and dropped to around $16,000. 2024-2025 Stabilization: Bitcoin has regained strength as interest rates have fallen slightly, consolidating its role as a hedge against expansionary monetary policy and inflation. What Happens to Bitcoin If the Fed Cuts Interest Rates? According to Alphractal, the impact of future rate cuts will depend on their nature: Emergency Cuts (Symptom of Crisis): If the Fed is forced to cut rates due to a major economic shock (similar to 2008 or 2020), initial market reactions may be bearish, with both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin experiencing sharp declines. Preemptive Cuts (Soft Landing): Gradual interest rate cuts, as seen in 1995-1996 and 2019, can support market growth, benefiting both stocks and digital assets. Market Scenarios 2025: Alphractal's Forecasts Alphractal outlines three possible scenarios for 2025: Gradual Rate Cuts: If the Fed cuts interest rates in a controlled manner without triggering a recession, the S&P 500 could maintain its upward momentum and Bitcoin could benefit from increased liquidity. External Shock: A new crisis such as geopolitical instability, banking collapse or another pandemic could cause a sharp decline in the market despite interest rate cuts. Persistently High Interest Rates: If inflation remains stubborn and the Fed maintains or raises interest rates, a severe market correction similar to 2000 or 2008 could ensue. *This is not investment advice.

The fourth-quarter GDP numbers “demonstrate that the economy is heading into this year with great momentum and profitability and is resilient to some level of policy uncertainty,” Wells Fargo economists Shannon Grein and Tim Quinlan said. But they fretted over how businesses would respond if trade conditions changed and uncertainty over where the economy is headed. That level of profitability is far above historical averages, which suggests that companies may be able to swallow persistent cost increases rather than pass them on to consumers. That could help keep inflation under control even as trade policies change. Consumer spending slows as businesses stock up Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the economy, increased at a revised 4% pace in the fourth quarter, a bit below prior estimates. And businesses raced to import goods ahead of anticipated tariffs, which helped fuel a jump in imports. The trade gap stayed elevated in February but shrank slightly from a record in January. Some economists caution that this surge of imports will lead to a slowdown in GDP growth in early 2025. Another key economic measure, gross domestic income (GDI), rose 4.5% in the fourth quarter from 1.4% in the third quarter. While GDP measures how much people and businesses spend on goods and services, GDI measures the income earned and the costs involved in producing them. Those two measures grew 3.5% on average last quarter, the fastest pace in a year. A report on Thursday showed that new unemployment claims held steady at 224,000 last week, meaning that the number of people applying for jobless benefits changed a bit. Uncertain trade policies shape 2025 economic outlook Economic growth was robust in the fourth quarter of 2024 but is expected to slow in the months ahead. Most economists are cautious about the future, pointing to shifting trade policies and business uncertainty. Even two of the most powerful investment banks in the world, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have already cut back their forecasts, citing the uncertain global trade environment as a potential drag on economic growth. In an age of surging tariffs, new trade deals, and the potential creation of additional policies, businesses are increasingly reluctant to invest and expand as they work through the unclear swamps of an uncertain market environment. These concerns have led to an update of the Federal Reserveʼs economic outlook and a recognition of the risks to growth. Some economists now expect G.D.P. to reduce in the first three months of 2025 as businesses and consumers dial back spending in the face of an uncertain economic outlook. A rise in imports in the early months of the year, partly propelled by companies stockpiling goods ahead of new tariffs, could also depress growth. If companies cut back on production or lower spending because of higher costs, that could slash more water on economic activity.

42501265,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144063,1743117638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Lightning-Fast Crypto Trading: Jupiter DEX Unleashes Signless Transactions on Solana,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jupiter-dex-signless-solana/,"Are you tired of slow crypto transactions and hefty fees slowing down your trading game? In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), every second counts, and every penny saved is a penny earned. For Solana enthusiasts and high-frequency traders, the wait for a game-changing solution is finally over! Jupiter, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, has just dropped a bombshell update that promises to redefine trading speed and efficiency. Get ready to experience the future of DeFi trading with Jupiter DEX ‘s revolutionary new feature: Quick Accounts. What are Solana Signless Transactions and Why Should You Care? Imagine executing trades on the Solana blockchain without the constant need to manually sign each transaction with your wallet. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, dream no more! Solana signless transactions are now a reality thanks to Jupiter’s innovative Quick Accounts. This groundbreaking feature leverages embedded wallets to enable a smoother, faster, and significantly cheaper trading experience. But what exactly are signless transactions, and why are they such a big deal? In traditional blockchain transactions, every action, whether it’s swapping tokens, providing liquidity, or interacting with a smart contract, requires a digital signature from your wallet. This process, while crucial for security, can introduce delays and add to transaction costs. Signless transactions, on the other hand, streamline this process by utilizing embedded wallets that handle transaction signing behind the scenes, offering a near-instantaneous trading experience. Think of it as autopilot for your crypto trades! Here’s a simple breakdown: Traditional Transactions: User initiates transaction -> Wallet prompts for signature -> User signs -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Signless Transactions (with Jupiter Quick Accounts): User initiates transaction -> Embedded wallet signs automatically -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Unpacking Jupiter’s Embedded Wallets and Quick Accounts At the heart of this innovation are embedded wallets . Jupiter’s Quick Accounts are essentially smart contract-based wallets that are seamlessly integrated into the Jupiter DEX platform. These wallets are designed to manage transaction signing automatically, eliminating the need for manual wallet interactions for every trade. This integration is not just about speed; it’s about creating a more user-friendly and efficient trading environment, especially crucial for those engaged in rapid-fire trading strategies. Let’s delve deeper into the key aspects of Jupiter Quick Accounts: Speed Boost: By automating the signing process, Quick Accounts drastically reduce transaction times. This is a game-changer for traders who need to react quickly to market fluctuations. Reduced Fees: Faster transactions often translate to lower gas fees on the Solana network, making trading more cost-effective, particularly for high-volume traders. Lower DeFi transaction fees mean more profit in your pocket. Enhanced User Experience: Say goodbye to constant wallet pop-ups and signature requests. Quick Accounts offer a streamlined, almost centralized exchange-like trading experience within the decentralized realm. Security Considerations: While signless transactions offer convenience, security remains paramount. Jupiter has implemented robust security measures for Quick Accounts, but users should always exercise caution and understand the security implications of using embedded wallets. Always do your own research (DYOR) and manage your risk accordingly. The Tremendous Benefits of Crypto Trading Speed for Solana Users Why is crypto trading speed so critical, especially on a blockchain like Solana, known for its high throughput? The answer lies in the nature of crypto markets – they are volatile, dynamic, and move at lightning speed. Faster transaction execution can mean the difference between a profitable trade and a missed opportunity. For Solana users, Jupiter’s Quick Accounts unlock a new level of trading agility. Consider these advantages: Benefit Description Impact on Traders Faster Order Execution Signless transactions minimize delays in processing trades. Capture fleeting market opportunities, execute trades at desired prices more consistently. Reduced Slippage Quicker trades mean less time for price to move against you before your order is filled. Minimize losses due to unfavorable price changes during transaction processing. Improved Arbitrage Opportunities Speed is paramount in arbitrage trading. Signless transactions provide the edge needed to capitalize on price differences across exchanges. Unlock more arbitrage opportunities and increase profitability from arbitrage strategies. Better Performance for Algorithmic Trading Algorithmic trading bots rely on speed and efficiency. Quick Accounts enhance the performance of automated trading strategies on Jupiter. Optimize algorithmic trading strategies for maximum efficiency and profitability. Addressing Potential Challenges and Security Aspects While the advantages are clear, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges. Any new technology comes with learning curves and considerations. For embedded wallets and signless transactions, users should be mindful of: Security Practices: Understanding the security framework of embedded wallets is crucial. Users need to trust the platform and ensure they are following best practices for account security. Smart Contract Risks: Quick Accounts rely on smart contracts. While audited, smart contracts are not immune to vulnerabilities. Users should be aware of smart contract risks associated with DeFi platforms. Custodial Aspects: While presented as non-custodial in the sense that you retain control over your funds within the smart contract, embedded wallets introduce a different custodial model compared to traditional self-custody. Understanding this nuance is key. Platform Dependency: Reliance on Jupiter’s infrastructure is inherent when using Quick Accounts. Users should consider the platform’s reliability and reputation. Jupiter has emphasized security in the development of Quick Accounts. However, as with any DeFi innovation, users are encouraged to exercise caution, educate themselves thoroughly, and only use services they fully understand and trust. Actionable Insights: Getting Started with Jupiter Quick Accounts Ready to dive into the world of signless transactions on Jupiter? Here’s a quick guide to get you started: Visit Jupiter DEX: Head over to the Jupiter DEX platform . Connect Your Wallet: Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to the platform. Explore Quick Accounts: Look for the Quick Accounts feature within the Jupiter interface (likely under account settings or trading preferences). Enable Quick Accounts: Follow the prompts to set up and enable Quick Accounts. This might involve creating a new embedded wallet or linking an existing one. Start Trading: Once enabled, you can start experiencing the speed and efficiency of signless transactions. Monitor and Manage: Keep an eye on your Quick Accounts and transactions. Familiarize yourself with the platform’s security features and best practices. Jupiter’s Quick Accounts represent a significant leap forward in making DeFi trading more accessible and efficient. By embracing Solana signless transactions and embedded wallets, Jupiter is not just enhancing its platform; it’s contributing to the evolution of the entire DeFi ecosystem. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of DeFi Trading Jupiter’s introduction of Quick Accounts is more than just an update; it’s a bold step towards the future of DeFi trading. By tackling the challenges of transaction speed and fees head-on, Jupiter is paving the way for a more seamless, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized trading experience. The era of lightning-fast crypto trading on Solana is here, and Jupiter DEX is leading the charge.

Bitcoin Faces Pressure After Massive Long Position Wipeout,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/are-the-bulls-still-in-control-bitcoin-faces-pressure-after-massive-long-position-wipeout/,"Bitcoin continues to show signs of price consolidation, with its value hovering just below the $87,000 mark. As of today, BTC is trading at approximately $86,990, reflecting a 0.8% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the slight dip, the broader picture shows that Bitcoin has stabilized above $85,000 for several consecutive sessions, signaling a pause in the strong upward or downward momentum observed in previous weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $86K as On-Chain Data Points to ‘Bullish Shift’ Long Liquidation Indication For The Market While volatility appears subdued, market dynamics remain active behind the scenes. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s latest market structure, highlighting a key development: the liquidation of $359.7 million worth of long positions. This event has drawn attention to potential shifts in sentiment and important technical levels that may act as support or resistance in the short term. According to Taha, a long liquidation occurs when traders holding leveraged long positions are forced to close their trades after the price drops below their margin thresholds. When this happens at scale, as seen recently, it reflects a sudden change in sentiment and often forces short-term sell-offs. However, Taha points out that such events can also set the stage for a potential market rebound, as many overleveraged positions are cleared, giving space for new demand to emerge. Liquidation event of $359.7M in long positions “If BTC holds above the short-term realized price, it suggests strength in demand. A breakdown below these levels might indicate a potential reversal or correction.” – By Amr Taha Full post ⤵️https://t.co/SW9e16kofW pic.twitter.com/0YR9rfreGa — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Bitcoin UTXO Metrics Paint a Mixed Picture Complementing this observation is Bitcoin’s realized price distribution by UTXO age bands. Taha notes that Bitcoin’s current market price remains above the realized price for UTXOs aged 1 day to 1 week, indicating that recent buyers are holding unrealized profits. Meanwhile, UTXOs in the 1-week to 1-month range have their realized price near $84,740—a level that could act as technical support if Bitcoin dips in the near term. This confluence of short-term holder profitability and support near $84K may serve as an important signal. If Bitcoin maintains its position above these realized price zones, it suggests continued strength from recent buyers. However, if the price begins to fall below these thresholds, it could point to increased selling pressure or a broader correction phase.

As key breakout levels loom, market watchers are buzzing with curiosity. Will these assets surge to new heights, or falter under pressure? Discover the exciting potential and hidden opportunities within the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency. Worldcoin: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Pressure The past month Worldcoin experienced a 7.39% decline paired with a 9.10% weekly rebound, indicating volatile price swings. Over the past six months, the coin has dropped sharply by 53.76%, reflecting a significant bearish trend amid persistent downward pressure. The price actions reveal a market that struggled to maintain momentum over a longer cycle while showing glimpses of recovery in the short run. These changes outline a history marked by rapid declines along with sporadic rallies that indicate the coin’s reactive nature in bearish market conditions. The coin currently trades between $0.78 and $1.62, with a key resistance level set at $2.14 and strong support around $0.46. Technical measures suggest balanced activity between bulls and bears, with no decisive trend direction. Traders could consider buying near support and taking profits as resistance nears, keeping a close eye on market fluctuations. GALA Price Trends and Key Trading Levels GALA showed a mild recovery over the past month, gaining approximately 5% with a monthly increase around 5.5%. However, it has experienced a six-month decline of nearly 21%, indicating ongoing downward pressure despite recent short-term strength. The price action has fluctuated, with various upswings from a low range. Overall, sentiment among traders appears cautious as they assess the market's direction. Current price is between $0.0129 and $0.0293, with resistance around $0.0392 and support at $0.0065. Bulls are currently testing the resistance levels while bears exert pressure, leading to a lack of a clear trend. Traders might consider entering positions near support and monitoring for a breakout above resistance, which could signal potential upward momentum. Conclusion WLD and GALA are nearing critical breakout points. Such levels suggest a potential for upward movement. If the breakout is confirmed, investors might see significant gains. Monitoring these levels closely will be essential to capitalize on the possible price surge. While the immediate future looks promising, only time will reveal if these cryptocurrencies can maintain their momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Hyperliquid has just announced a significant expansion to its offerings. Get ready to dive into the world of ETH trading as deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading for Ether (ETH) are now officially live on Hyperliquid. This development marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the wider crypto community, opening up new avenues for traders and investors alike. Let’s explore what this exciting launch means for you. Why is ETH Trading on Hyperliquid a Game Changer? The introduction of ETH trading on Hyperliquid isn’t just another listing; it’s a strategic move that brings numerous benefits to users. Hyperliquid has quickly gained attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space for its innovative approach and robust infrastructure. Adding ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, to its trading roster significantly enhances the platform’s appeal and utility. But what exactly makes this launch so impactful? Expanded Trading Opportunities: With ETH trading now available, Hyperliquid users have access to a wider range of trading pairs and opportunities. Ethereum is a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, and its availability on Hyperliquid provides traders with more flexibility and portfolio diversification options. Enhanced Liquidity: Listing ETH typically attracts more users and trading volume, leading to increased liquidity on the platform. Higher liquidity translates to tighter spreads, faster order execution, and reduced slippage, all of which are crucial for efficient crypto spot trading . Platform Growth: The addition of ETH can be seen as a sign of Hyperliquid’s growth and maturity. It demonstrates the platform’s commitment to expanding its offerings and becoming a comprehensive hub for decentralized trading. Access to DeFi Ecosystem: Ethereum is the backbone of a vast DeFi ecosystem. By facilitating Ethereum trading , Hyperliquid is further integrating itself into this ecosystem, potentially unlocking future integrations and opportunities for its users. Navigating the World of Decentralized Exchange ETH Trading on Hyperliquid For those new to decentralized exchanges or Hyperliquid itself, understanding the basics is essential before diving into ETH trading . Decentralized exchanges differ significantly from centralized exchanges in their operational model and ethos. Here’s a quick rundown: Feature Decentralized Exchange (DEX) – Hyperliquid Centralized Exchange (CEX) Custody of Funds Users retain control of their private keys and funds. Users deposit funds, and the exchange controls custody. Transparency Transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, offering high transparency. Transactions are often less transparent, with order books and execution details sometimes opaque. Security Relies on smart contracts and blockchain security; reduces single point of failure risks. Vulnerable to centralized points of failure and hacking of exchange infrastructure. Regulation Operates with less regulatory oversight, though this landscape is evolving. Subject to stricter regulatory compliance and KYC/AML procedures. Accessibility Potentially more accessible globally, without stringent KYC in some cases. May have geographical restrictions and stricter onboarding processes. Hyperliquid, as a decentralized exchange , embodies these DEX principles, offering users a platform for crypto spot trading where they maintain control over their assets. The launch of ETH trading further enriches this ecosystem. Unlocking the Potential of Crypto Spot Trading with ETH on Hyperliquid Crypto spot trading refers to the immediate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for instant delivery. Unlike futures or margin trading, spot trading involves direct ownership of the asset. With ETH trading now live on Hyperliquid, users can engage in spot trading with Ethereum, leveraging the platform’s decentralized nature and unique features. What are some key benefits of engaging in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid? Direct Ownership: When you engage in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid, you directly own the ETH you purchase. This ownership is recorded on the blockchain, giving you full control over your assets. Simplicity: Spot trading is generally simpler to understand compared to more complex trading instruments like derivatives. It’s a straightforward way to buy or sell ETH based on your market analysis and strategy. Decentralized Security: Trading ETH on a decentralized exchange like Hyperliquid enhances security by minimizing counterparty risk. Your funds are not held by a central entity, reducing the risk of exchange hacks or failures. Transparency and Control: DEXs like Hyperliquid offer greater transparency in trading operations. You can often verify transactions on the blockchain, and you retain control over your private keys, empowering you in your trading journey. Navigating Challenges in ETH Trading on a Decentralized Exchange While decentralized exchange ETH trading on platforms like Hyperliquid offers numerous advantages, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Complexity for Beginners: DEXs can sometimes have a steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with concepts like wallet management, gas fees, and blockchain interactions. However, platforms are continually working on improving user experience. Gas Fees: Transactions on Ethereum and many DEXs involve gas fees, which can fluctuate and sometimes be high, especially during periods of network congestion. Understanding and managing gas fees is crucial for cost-effective ETH trading . Smart Contract Risks: While smart contracts enhance security, they are not immune to vulnerabilities. It’s essential to use reputable and audited DEX platforms like Hyperliquid, which prioritize security and smart contract integrity. Liquidity Fragmentation: While Hyperliquid aims to provide robust liquidity, liquidity can sometimes be fragmented across different DEXs compared to centralized exchanges. It’s important to monitor liquidity when engaging in larger trades. Actionable Insights for Getting Started with ETH Trading on Hyperliquid Ready to jump into ETH trading on Hyperliquid? Here are some actionable insights to get you started on the right foot: Set up your Wallet: Ensure you have a compatible Web3 wallet like MetaMask or WalletConnect. Connect your wallet to the Hyperliquid platform. Fund your Account: Deposit ETH or other supported cryptocurrencies into your Hyperliquid account through your connected wallet. Remember to factor in gas fees for transactions. Explore the Platform: Familiarize yourself with the Hyperliquid trading interface. Understand how to navigate the order book, charts, and trading tools. Start Small: If you’re new to DEX trading or Hyperliquid, begin with smaller trades to get comfortable with the platform and processes. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market trends, Hyperliquid platform updates, and security best practices in the DeFi space. Utilize Resources: Hyperliquid likely offers documentation, tutorials, or community support channels. Make use of these resources to enhance your understanding and trading experience.

Elise Stefanik’s nomination as US ambassador to the UN has greatly impacted President Donald Trump’s choice of Cabinet members. Her confirmation had been postponed because of concerns about the narrow House margins for Republicans. Trump confirmed the ruling in a post on Truth Social, saying that they had to keep all of the Republican seats in Congress. GOP scraps Stefanik’s UN nomination to preserve House majority Stefanik was nominated shortly after Trump was reelected in November to represent the United States at the global organization. Although her nomination advanced out of committee in late January, and she was regarded as one of the least controversial Cabinet choices, the House Republicans’ razor-thin majority kept her eventual confirmation in a state of purgatory for the past few months. Stefanik’s nomination appeared to make it to the Senate floor recently, especially since Florida had two U.S. House special elections in districts that Trump won easily in 2024. However, concerns about maintaining the Republican majority ultimately led to the decision to withdraw her from consideration. “We must be unified to accomplish our mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts. As one of my biggest allies, I have asked Elise to remain in Congress,” the president said. He, however, did not specify who he would propose to take her place. On the other hand, Stefanik’s office did not immediately answer a request for comment. Keeping Stefanik in the House would have provided Republicans, who control 218 seats, more flexibility in passing legislation in an increasingly divided Congress. The Democratic caucus holds 213 seats. The GOP also took notice after Democrats won an unexpected victory in a Pennsylvania state Senate special election, flipping a seat in a Republican-leaning district. Stefanik is the fourth Trump administration nominee who did not make it through the confirmation process. Former U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz was withdrawn from consideration for the position of attorney general, Chad Chronister was removed from consideration for the position of Drug Enforcement Administration, and Dr David Weldon, a former congressman from Florida, was removed from consideration for the position of CDR. Trump withdraws Chad Chronister’s DEA nomination amid conservative backlash Trump’s selection for DEA chief, Chad Chronister, also faced confirmation troubles. A couple of months ago, Trump abruptly resigned the sheriff from a Senate confirmation position and removed his name from the list of candidates for the job. Consequently, Chronister shared an X post stating that he had turned down the offer, calling it the honour of a lifetime. Without going into further detail, Chronister wrote, “Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I have concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.” Trump explained on his social media account, Truth Social, that Chronister resigned suddenly because he did not agree with what the sheriff had told his pastors and other supporters. Some conservatives criticized Chronister for his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic and for claiming that his office was not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Deep altcoin dips could spark a reevaluation of risk, prompting a realignment of strategies. Investors might soon favor assets with stable fundamentals and robust network support. The top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization lost a combined $659 billion between January and March 2025, according to a Thursday report by CryptoQuant . Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) took the hardest hits during the downturn, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) showed more stable performance. XRP, which saw a surge earlier in the cycle, failed to maintain its gains. CryptoQuant: BTC and BNB Withstand Market Pressure CryptoQuant’s analysis showed that BTC and BNB weathered the market drop better than their peers. Each asset declined by around 20% from its most recent all-time high, marking a milder correction compared to the rest of the top five. BNB’s stability is particularly notable, as it has maintained a consistently shallow drawdown range throughout the observed period. This resilience is partly driven by practical utility across the Binance ecosystem, all of which require users to actively hold BNB. ETH and SOL… pic.twitter.com/9d6CagU2jY — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Their relative strength stood in contrast to the sharp pullbacks seen in Ethereum and Solana, both of which saw more severe losses. XRP, despite a market cap rally following the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, also slipped behind in recent weeks. ETH/BTC Ratio Fell 72% Since September 2022, CryptoQuant Data Shows Another key metric highlighted in the report is Ethereum’s falling value relative to Bitcoin. Since September 2022, the ETH/BTC ratio has dropped by 72%, reaching its lowest level since January 2020. Historically, such dips have sometimes preceded a reversal, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure against Bitcoin. Mixed Signals from XRP Performance XRP experienced a sharp rise in market capitalization following regulatory optimism in late 2024. Its valuation jumped from $30 billion in early November to $141 billion by March 2025. This growth was supported by increased activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), where active addresses spiked from 15,000 to 109,000. However, that momentum has since faded. As of now, daily active addresses have settled between 20,000 and 40,000, based on CryptoQuant’s latest data. The report paints a clear picture of how leading digital assets are moving in different directions. While Bitcoin and BNB have held their ground more effectively, ETH, SOL, and XRP have struggled to keep pace. CryptoQuant’s findings underscore the uneven impact of the current market correction and suggest that the next few months could be key in determining whether these trends deepen or reverse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What might this divergence mean for crypto’s long-term structure? The split may drive a reallocation of capital toward coins that deliver steady network metrics and lower volatility, potentially redefining market norms and investment strategies. How could these corrections influence risk management in crypto portfolios? Investors might adopt more disciplined approaches by diversifying holdings and emphasizing assets with proven fundamentals, leading to a strategic reassessment of exposure and risk tolerance. Which emerging trends could gain favor as portfolios are rebalanced? Expect growing interest in projects that blend strong network effects with scalable, low-cost solutions, attracting long-term capital and sparking renewed innovation in blockchain protocols.

The bloc’s decision comes after Washington slapped a 25 percent tariff on the car industry and hinted at further measures next week. One EU diplomat told FT, “The Americans think that they are the ones with escalation dominance [in the trade war], but we also have the ability to do that,” stressing that the ultimate goal is to de-escalate tensions and reach a comprehensive trade deal. Officials believe that by targeting services where the US shows vulnerability, they can force Washington to come to the negotiating table. Brussels had already responded by imposing extra duties on up to €26 billion of US goods following tariffs on steel and aluminum. However, European officials say the scale of the Trump administration’s actions has forced the EU to consider using even more powerful trade tools. The EU’s legal framework targets intellectual property and contracts Under its Enforcement Regulation, strengthened in 2021 after an earlier trade dispute, the EU has the power to suspend intellectual property rights and exclude companies from public procurement contracts. A potential fightback might involve restrictions on the intellectual property rights of major tech companies. This could include a ban on Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network from winning government contracts. In fact, Italy is already rethinking its plans to acquire the system. “Services is where the US is vulnerable,” said a second diplomat. Moreover, Washington ran a €109 billion trade surplus with the EU in services in 2023, compared with a €157 billion deficit in goods. Economic risks and negotiation challenges loom ahead While some European diplomats are optimistic about reaching a deal quickly, they acknowledge that such an agreement would not automatically remove all the extra tariffs imposed by the US. “The view is that we have to respond. It is the only way to get a deal,” said a third EU diplomat, adding that previous attempts to talk had failed. Since the EU’s exports far outstrip its imports, the bloc would find it difficult to match the US tariffs on goods. Moreover, Brussels does not want to risk cutting off gas supplies from the United States, which are vital to the continent’s energy needs. “There are only so many goods imports from the US that the EU can target before that damages the economy too much,” explained David Henig from the European Centre for International Political Economy. “If you don’t want to target energy, there’s a limit to what can be done on goods. Whereas on services there is greater room for retaliation without so much harm to the economy.” Some experts argue that the EU might need to use its anti-coercion instrument, the “trade bazooka,” to inflict even more economic pain on the US. This tool could allow the European Commission to restrict activities by US banks, revoke patents, or prevent companies from receiving revenues from software updates or streaming. “I would advise the European Commission to use the ACI,” said Ignacio García Berrero, a former senior commission official who led negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a deal that was never finalized. Any retaliatory measures would be drafted by the European Commission but must gain the approval of a weighted majority of member states. EU countries are still negotiating the goods retaliation list that was drawn up in response to Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. For example, France has pressed for bourbon whiskey to be removed from the list to protect its own drinks industry. The commission has postponed measures covering jeans, motorcycles, and possibly soyabeans until April 12. These measures will be discussed with national leaders before a final decision is made. Diplomats and officials also noted that more tariffs on googs could be on the table in response to any US reciprocal tariffs expected from the White House next week . Brussels estimates these tariffs could be around 20 percent and might hit aircraft, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products.

It was a calculated attempt to put an end to the industry,” Marszalek said in a March 27 X post. ”The fact that we not only persevered but became stronger is a testament to our vision and the community supporting it. Onwards!” It comes seven months after the SEC issued a Wells notice to the crypto platform in August, signaling its intention to take legal action against the firm. We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com,” added Crypto.com’s chief legal officer Nick Lundgren in a March 27 statement, which accused the previous administration of abusing its authority to harm the crypto industry. Source: Kris Marszalek Crypto.com had filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October, two months after the Wells notice, accusing the Gary Gensler-led commission of overstepping its authority and taking a “misguided” approach to crypto regulation. SEC continues to roll back previous enforcement actions Crypto.com’s announcement follows a wave of other crypto investigations and lawsuits dropped by the SEC over the last five weeks, which affected the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, OpenSea and more recently, Immutable. The SEC also dismissed its civil enforcement action against crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW with prejudice on March 27. Related: Ripple will drop cross-appeal in SEC case, get refund from lower court ruling The SEC has adopted a far friendlier approach since Mark Uyeda started leading the commission as acting chair on Jan. 20 after the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler.

It also canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets on Jan. 23.

Ethereum Supply Drops & ADA Awaits Breakout,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdags-path-to-1-gains-clarity-after-recent-ama-ethereum-supply-drops-ada-awaits-breakout/,"Ethereum supply on exchanges has fallen to a level not seen in nearly ten years, yet price action remains lackluster, sparking renewed discussions in the ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) also sits in a cautious zone, with its next movement depending on a critical technical breakout. In contrast to these slow-moving scenarios, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gathering strong traction. Its recent AMA revealed detailed plans for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) along with a rollout to 10 major exchanges. As a result, analysts now expect BDAG to potentially reach $1 by 2025—positioning it among the best crypto to buy right now. Ethereum Market Shows Mixed Signals as Exchange Supply Declines The ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis points out that ETH holdings on centralised exchanges have reached the lowest point since 2015, hinting at a growing trend toward holding and staking. With just 8.97 million ETH remaining on exchanges, Santiment data indicates a 16.4% decrease over the past seven weeks. Still, ETH’s value has dropped nearly 47% from its peak last December. Technical signals remain weak, with Ethereum struggling to clear major resistance zones. Slower fee revenue, lower DeFi usage on the mainnet, and increasing competition from layer-2 platforms have all contributed to a blurry short-term picture for Ethereum. Cardano Price Prediction Depends on Crucial Breakout Zones Current Cardano (ADA) price prediction sees limited clarity as ADA trades near $0.72, falling 2% in the past day. A 25% dip in trading volume also signals decreased trader interest. Analysts note a symmetrical triangle forming, suggesting the next move could decide ADA’s near-term direction. From a technical viewpoint, the Cardano price prediction depends on a breakout. Moving past $0.74 could open the way to $0.83, while slipping under $0.70 could lead ADA toward $0.65. Liquidation zones at $0.71 and $0.73, as shown by on-chain metrics, reflect strong indecision among market players. BlockDAG Eyes $1 Mark as TGE Plans Go Viral in Recent AMA BlockDAG’s latest AMA revealed a full breakdown of what many are calling one of the most well-prepared launches in today’s crypto space. The team outlined specific steps for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), setting the stage for its official market debut. Among the key updates, BDAG will be fully tradable shortly after TGE. Work is already underway to ensure listings on 10 well-known centralised exchanges, including top-tier platforms that could drive stronger volume and attention. This upfront strategy has boosted confidence. Since the announcement, presale activity has surged. BlockDAG has now collected more than $207 million, with over 18.9 billion BDAG coins sold across 27 separate presale rounds. These milestones point to growing belief from the market, as many are eager to grab BDAG before it becomes openly available. This demand continues to push BDAG into the spotlight as the best crypto to buy right now. Outlook for BDAG remains positive. The coin has jumped 2380% already—from $0.001 in early rounds to $0.0248 in the current batch. Forecasts now suggest BDAG could reach $1 in 2025, supported by a clear rollout plan, planned listings, and solid early performance. This places BlockDAG among the top breakout projects under watch before it fully enters the market. Final Take! Ethereum’s reduced exchange supply signals long-term confidence, but weak price action still clouds its outlook, as outlined in the latest Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Cardano continues to hover in a narrow range, with any breakout likely to shape the short-term Cardano (ADA) price prediction. On the other hand, BlockDAG appears to be entering a new phase of rapid development. With its Token Generation Event strategy clearly outlined and exchange listings in progress, BDAG is building strong momentum. Analysts predict it could hit $1 in 2025, and with its current presale price at $0.0248, BDAG is now widely seen as the best crypto to buy right now.

Lookonchain notes on the social media platform X that the whale spent $5 million worth of Circle’s stablecoin, USDC , to buy TRUMP right after President Donald Trump posted “I LOVE $TRUMP” on his social media platform Truth Social. The whale then sold the TRUMP stash an hour later, booking a $207,000 loss. However, the loss pales in comparison to gains the whale made earlier this year when it spent 1.09 million USDC to buy 5.97 million TRUMP and booked a $108 million profit, according to Lookonchain. The president launched the Official Trump memecoin in mid-January, days before he took office. The asset has generated controversy in and out of crypto circles, raising questions of corruption in an already heavily questioned administration. Even Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said in January that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued TRUMP could be a violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

People are looking beyond flashy price charts. What they really want are the best crypto projects in 2025—ones with strong real-world use, powerful tech, and the chance for real growth. That’s why attention is turning to four key names: BlockDAG, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Each of these coins has its own strengths, and if current trends continue, they could see strong gains soon. BlockDAG: Is This the Next $1 Coin by 2025 with 3932% Growth? BlockDAG (BDAG) ranks high among the best crypto projects in 2025. It runs on a smart system called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which allows transactions to take place at the same time—no delays or traffic issues. This leads to faster processing and smooth performance, making it a great choice for developers building fast and reliable decentralised apps. In its presale, BlockDAG has brought in more than $207 million. A total of 18.9 billion BDAG coins have already been sold. At batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, and those who joined early have seen a return of 2,380%. Analysts say BDAG might reach $1 in 2025, which would be a 3,932% increase from where it is now. With the mainnet expected later this year and ten confirmed CEX listings in 2025, BlockDAG is seen as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for early access to high returns. XRP: Designed for Fast, Large-Scale Transfers XRP continues to gain ground as a top name in digital payments. The United Nations has mentioned XRP in relation to a possible cashless global system. There is even speculation about Donald Trump possibly including it in a US crypto reserve. Maximilian Staudinger, a well-known analyst, suggested XRP could help unlock $1.5 trillion from Nostro accounts used for cross-border payments. What makes XRP one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is its speed and ease of use. Some believe it may become part of official global reserves, and the interest around this continues to rise. It hasn’t yet broken past $3, but the selling pressure is lower now, with an RSI of 34. In the past 24 hours, XRP moved up 12.4%, now priced at $2.53. It’s showing steady movement, and many are watching to see if it can finally cross that $3 line. Solana (SOL): Potential ETF Launch May Drive 2025 Growth Solana’s strong point is its role as a fast and cheaper option compared to Ethereum. Since its 2020 launch, it has reached a market cap of $65.6 billion. Talks are going on about the SEC allowing spot ETFs for Solana in 2025, which could draw in users from traditional finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum have ETF approvals already, so some believe Solana could be next. Its price has fallen around 50% since its $260 high in January, mostly due to broader market conditions. The RSI is now at 57 and is moving slowly upward, suggesting demand is cooling for now. Still, many see Solana as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 if ETF approval happens and market activity rises again. Cardano (ADA): Focused on Careful Growth and Clear Plans Cardano, with its $25.2 billion market value, is aiming to grow as a serious option alongside Ethereum and Solana. There’s talk that Trump might also include ADA in the US crypto reserve idea. Charles Hoskinson, who co-created Ethereum, started Cardano in 2014 to offer something more stable and well-planned. One reason many view ADA as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is the team’s open way of working. Right now, ADA is staying around the $0.70 level with resistance at $1 and $1.10. These price levels show a slow but steady path. Its mix of clear growth, stability, and detailed progress has made ADA a strong option to follow. Best Crypto Projects in 2025– Final Remarks! Looking toward 2025, XRP is building a real use case in payments and may benefit from political moves. Solana is waiting for ETF chances, and Cardano keeps improving steadily with on-chain upgrades. However, BlockDAG stands out. With over 2,380% gains already and a price of $0.0248 in batch 27, many believe it could hit $1. A return of 3,932% would make it one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for those aiming for early growth with long-term value. It’s showing clear signs of being ready for the next big move.

The cloud provider sold 37.5 million shares at $40 each. It had initially planned to sell 49 million shares at $47 to $55 each, but a weaker-than-expected stock market posed difficulties for the company. The company initially sought to raise $4 billion at a $35 billion valuation, reporting $1.9 billion in revenue last year but still seeing a net loss of nearly $900 million. AI powerhouse Nvidia, an investor in CoreWeave, is anchoring the IPO with a $250 million order, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. CoreWeave is closely tied to bitcoin miner CoreScientific, which struck a multi-billion deal with the New Jersey-based firm to expand its artificial intelligence capabilities. Nvidia's own stock price is down 12% since the beginning of the year, The Information reported late Thursday, reflecting broader weakness in AI-focused firms.

President Donald Trump appears open to a deal that leaves some involvement for the Chinese company. Lawmakers such as Michigan Republican John Moolenaar have warned that any arrangement giving ByteDance continued control is a grave threat to US security and a violation of American law. At a TikTok Coalition event on Thursday, Moolenaar said, “Any deal that allows ByteDance to maintain control of TikTok is a grave threat to our security and a violation of US law. If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal – plain and simple.” Recent reports indicate that a prospective deal would allow ByteDance to retain a stake in TikTok. Under the proposal, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle. The move is part of talks led by the White House, centered on a “qualified divestiture.” The law mandates that a foreign adversary must no longer control the app, defined as holding a stake of 20 percent or more, while leaving room for the president to set the terms. President Trump is eager to “save” the app and would go to extra lengths. He has not clearly stated whether he would support ByteDance having a partial role in TikTok. On Wednesday, he said he might lower tariffs on China to secure Beijing’s support and would consider extending the April 5 deadline if no agreement is reached. Trump talks about the TikTok deal at the Oval Office. Source: Bloomberg The law originally set the deadline as January 19 with a one-time 90-day extension for progress, and Trump had extended it on his first day in office after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The forced sale law, passed last year as part of a foreign aid package, was enacted amid concerns that TikTok’s Chinese ownership might allow Beijing to conduct influence operations against the United States. While the law mandates a divestiture, free speech advocates warn that a ban would restrict Americans’ access to foreign media. It would violate the First Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January, maintaining pressure on TikTok to separate from its Chinese owner. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts stated that the US intelligence community had “no information” that ByteDance manipulated TikTok content to favor the Chinese government. On Monday, Markey, along with Senators Cory Booker and Chris Van Hollen, sent a letter urging Trump to work with Congress on a legal basis for any extension. Earlier this year, they and Representative Ro Khanna of California introduced a bill to extend the original January 19 deadline by 270 days. Some Republicans want pure TikTok divestiture Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack called for “an absolute pure divestiture” on Thursday. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, known as one of the strongest supporters, has yet to firmly take a stand on the need for complete divestiture, with reports indicating he is allowing the White House to handle the negotiations. When asked about President Trump’s recent remarks, Guo Jiakun, spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Beijing has stated its position on TikTok on multiple occasions. He added that China’s opposition to extra tariffs is “consistent and clear.” In January, China’s foreign ministry also expressed openness to a TikTok deal, noting that acquisitions should be “decided independently by companies” according to the law. Some reports have suggested that TikTok’s algorithm may be subject to export controls by China’s commerce ministry. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company’s revised investment policy now permits a portion of its corporate treasury and future borrowings to be invested directly into Bitcoin and stablecoins. Despite declining net sales, GameStop holds significant liquidity, reporting cash reserves of $4.77 billion as of February. This strategic pivot aligns closely with previous Bitcoin adoption moves by firms such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, both of which have seen notable stock appreciation after similar announcements . An announcement regarding Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gG8JRarIok — GameStop (@gamestop) March 25, 2025 GameStop’s Bitcoin investment further validates the cryptocurrency’s growing appeal among corporate treasuries, potentially attracting broader institutional participation and strengthening Bitcoin’s market position. MicroStrategy’s Growing Bitcoin Ambitions MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy, could accumulate more than one million Bitcoin by 2033—equating to nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply—according to analysts at Bernstein. Currently, the firm owns approximately 506,137 Bitcoin, purchased at an average cost of $66,608.

Bernstein forecasts Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by 2025 and possibly $1 million by 2033, driven by supportive monetary policies and strong capital markets. Under bullish market conditions, Strategy’s holdings could reach 5.8% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Strategy’s continued Bitcoin accumulation underscores institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Nonetheless, short-term volatility persists, with Bitcoin recently trading around $86,982, down 1.33% in the past 24 hours. U.S. Government Accelerates Digital Payment Transition President Donald Trump mandated a complete transition to digital federal payments by September 30, 2025, aiming to eliminate paper-based transactions. The administration expects annual taxpayer savings of approximately $657 million through reduced fraud and administrative costs. #ACH $SHx #Stronghold #NACHA Executive Orders March 25, 2025 Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account – Effective September 30, 2025 Read this: (e) The Secretary of the Treasury shall support agencies’ transition to digital payment methods, including… pic.twitter.com/Fs5dyq5FAb — Cpt. X (@DebunkJelpi) March 27, 2025 The executive order emphasizes electronic fund transfer (EFT) methods, including digital wallets, direct deposits, and debit cards, explicitly ruling out the adoption of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Trump’s administration maintains a clear stance against government-controlled digital currencies. This move toward digital payments may indirectly support increased Bitcoin adoption, as users shift toward decentralized digital assets rather than centralized digital currencies. Bitcoin Price Technical Outlook Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is consolidating near $87,220 within a symmetrical triangle formation on the 2-hour chart. Price action maintains key support at $86,800, reinforced by the 50-period EMA. Immediate resistance at $88,800 limits upside momentum, and a confirmed breakout above this level could target $90,750 and $92,800. On the downside, critical support levels remain at $86,400 and $84,870, with a sustained move below these zones potentially opening the door to $83,200. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral at 51, signaling balanced market sentiment. Traders should monitor volume closely to confirm the next major directional move.

Analyst Says A Weekly Close Above This Level Would Trigger A Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-imminent/,"The crypto market is still trying to recover from its crash in early March, and sentiment is currently fluctuating. Although the Fear & Greed Index is still in the fear zone, the Bitcoin price is now slowly pushing back toward $90,000, which has been slowly changing the sentiment among altcoins. Rekt Capital, an influential analyst on X, reignited hope for an incoming altcoin season with a key technical signal. According to the post, a breakout in the altcoin market cap could soon take shape if one critical condition is met. The analyst shared a chart and commentary suggesting that the next major rally may already be in motion, provided that the altcoin market cap can secure a weekly close above a particular level. Weekly Close Above $250 Billion Could Be The Game Changer The altcoin market cap reached a multi-month low in the first week of March after the crash that saw many cryptocurrencies shell out weeks of price gains within a short period. This crash briefly pushed the altcoin market cap below $200 billion, although it eventually closed the week above this threshold. However, this market cap has steadily been inching upwards in the last two weeks since the crash. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat At the time of writing, the altcoin market cap has risen back to around $249 billion. Technical analysis from crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that a weekly close above the $250 billion mark would mark a significant technical shift for alts. This level, highlighted in blue on the chart below, will be an important resistance level for crypto investors waiting for the altcoin season. The analyst noted that a decisive close above it would likely precede a breakout rally toward the $315 billion level, marked in red. That move wouldn’t just signal short-term bullishness; it would also serve as confirmation that the bottom for altcoins has already been established. However, even if the altcoin market cap were to surge quickly towards $315, there would still be some work to do to return in order to the recent high of $451 billion set in December 2024. Shallow Correction Points To Stronger Momentum Ahead For Altcoin The nature of the current correction from this $451 billion altcoin market cap adds more weight to the possibility of an altcoin rally. According to the analyst, the ongoing correction has only reached a 55% drawdown from its local high, notably shallower than the previous major altcoin bear market retracements of 69% and 85%. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Recent Crypto Dip Shows Decline May Be Over And Bulls Are Taking Charge The shallower decline in the current retracement is interpreted as a sign of growing market maturity among altcoins. This implies that the selling pressure may be waning and that bulls are preparing for a stronger push. It also means that the $425 billion altcoin market cap resistance is weakening as a point of rejection, which in turn increases the chances of a breakout at the next visit.

Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit, Lummis emphasized that Bitcoin’s scarcity , immutability, and storability make it a strong long-term asset for national stability. “If we hold for 20 years — according to the best available models — we could reduce our national debt by half,” she said, referring to the country’s eye-popping $36 trillion debt. Saylor and Lummis push for Bitcoin as America’s strategic reserve Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor , also sparked discussion at the summit, going so far as to say during his discussion with Lummis that Bitcoin is the “Manifest Destiny for the United States of America.” Lummis also argued for creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve, stressing that it should be treated similarly to current national reserves. “We have a strategic oil reserve, we have a strategic gold reserve, we have a strategic cheese reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold,” she said. Lummis also pointed out this classic way of the government converting mineral wealth into cash possessed by the government, which then invests it into diversified assets that still generate cash. She views Bitcoin as a next-generation answer to an ancestral monetary problem. “I’ve kind of been looking for the Bitcoin strategic reserve my whole life,” Lummis added, clarifying that she believes it’s Bitcoin that will shape the country’s economic destiny. Saylor’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic asset resonated beyond the summit. Within an hour of his statement being posted on X, Bitcoin saw a 0.11% increase, reaching $87,273.47. The asset’s market capitalization grew by 0.09% at press time. The market’s reaction indicated a big change in sentiment, with the Fear and Greed Index rising from a complacent 50 to a “Greed” status of 65. Witnessing this in such a short timeframe demonstrates Bitcoin’s impact not just beyond political discourse but also in terms of market dynamics. Saylor stands firm on $13 Million Bitcoin prediction, calls it the ultimate store of value Just recently, Saylor doubled down on his claim that Bitcoin’s price will go to $13 million over 20 years. While addressing the Digital Asset Summit, Saylor emphasized Bitcoin’s unique qualities as a scarce digital commodity, arguing that no other asset can compare. “I can stand here and I can tell you that I think the price of Bitcoin will go to $13 million over 20 years. I couldn’t say that about a security, right?” Saylor declared, highlighting Bitcoin’s legal status as a commodity rather than a security. According to Saylor, Bitcoin is the only asset immune to human corruption. He refers to its origin as a product of what he calls an “immaculate conception.” He noted that, unlike traditional commodities like gold or oil, which can be extracted in greater quantities when prices rise, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it the ultimate store of value. Bitcoin bears seize opportunity as bullish bets weaken ahead of $16.5B options expiry On March 28, bitcoin investors are preparing for the all-time high $16.5 billion monthly options expiry. Despite this, the real impact on the market would be low, with BTC dropping below $90,000 before blindsiding investors and invalidating many bullish positions. This transition offers Bitcoin bears a key chance to avoid a potential $3 billion loss, which may exert considerable pressure on the markets in the weeks ahead. The open interest in call (buy) options is $10.5 billion, while the open interest in put (sell) options is $6 billion. However, $7.6 billion worth of those calls are for prices of $92,000 or higher, requiring Bitcoin to rise 6.4% from its current value to become profitable before the March 28 expiry. This has greatly reduced the edge for bullish bets. Some analysts cite the ongoing global tariff war and the US government spending cuts that risk sending the economy into a recession as impacting Bitcoin’s price. Traders are concerned about slower growth—especially in the artificial intelligence space, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high on Feb. 19 only to dip 7%. The 40-day correlation has been above 70% since early March, but for the bulls, Bitcoin is still due for a decoupling from the stock market. This is driving optimism across the board, fueled by central banks expanding the monetary base and companies such as GameStop (GME), Rumble (RUM), Metaplanet (TYO:3350) and Semler Scientific (SMLR) adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On the other hand, the upcoming ADA competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is attracting investors thanks to a 15,240% upside forecast. As the price of ADA ultimately depends on overall market conditions as well as adoption, the presale frenzy of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its well-structured tokenomics are leading expectations for gains in exponential growth. Currently in Phase 3 of its 11-stage presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $5,400,000 and over 7,200 holders. This phase comes in at $0.02 and is nearly full with over to 95% sold out, with Phase 4 trekking up to $0.025 in price, a 25% increase. A launch price of $0.06 will earn first movers a quick 200% profit as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is listed. And post-launch projections have greater upside potential, with some observers targeting a climb above $1. Cardano (ADA): Hopeful signs, but a long uphill battle ahead Analysts are split on the potential of Cardano (ADA) following its recent performance. Currently trading at $0.70, Cardano (ADA) would need to boom 1,300% to scale the heights of $10 — not everyone considers it a lofty aim. Advocates cite its strong fundamentals such as scalability and security as well as growing integrations with DeFi. But skeptics also believe Cardano (ADA) gradual development speed can prevent fast price appreciation around the project. In the meantime, Cardano (ADA) looks speculative with its upside, while its competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has a more evident growth path backed by solid use cases. While Cardano (ADA) is dependent on a general phase of market speculation, the lending model and corresponding buy-pressure mechanisms built into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generate demand through a snapshot process that leads to out-competition in terms of percentage profit gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Creates Excitement A similar initiative is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform. The token considers not only its short term goals but also its long-term stability. This fast-paced development of the presale reflects strong buyers confidence. With Phase 3 nears completion. Phase 4 will open with a 25% gain for all buyers at $0.02 with guaranteed 200% returns upon launch. MUTM tokenomics enable sustained growth past the first listing. Ongoing demand is created by the platform’s revenue-driven buybacks and staking rewards, reducing selling pressure. Analysts believe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may prop up to the round of $1 which will still give Phase 3 investors over 4,900% profits on investments. Mutuum Finance emphasizes on Security. Smart contract audit coming from one of the top Blockchain security experts in the industry CertiK. Once completed the results will be found on the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) official channels and will be published thereafter. Why Cardano (ADA) Can’t Compete with MUTM For Short-Term Gains Even though the long-term prospects of Cardano are undeniable, the road to $10 is nothing more than ‘a wishful thinking moment’ in the hands of the market gods. By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a methodical, high-reward chance with clear milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale’s phased pricing model guarantees that early investors secure the bottom entry points, paving the way for maximum profit as the project moves forward. With the sale of Phase 3 almost complete, the opportunity to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02 is rapidly running out of time. Now is the prime time to get involved with a 25% price increase for the next stage looming on the horizon and entry prices set to soar.

After months of silence, the energy in the market has shifted overnight. Forget the old memes—this new wave is driven by fresh hype, viral moments, and tokens that know how to tap into culture and capital. Leading the charge? Solana-based Morning Routine (ROUTINE), which went viral in record time, and Dragoin ($DDGN) , a game-ready, dragon-themed Ethereum token that’s quickly becoming the most anticipated presale in crypto. With money flooding in and community momentum skyrocketing, the meme coin comeback of 2025 is already breaking records—and it’s only just beginning. Morning Routine: A Viral Video Turns Into a $19M Crypto Hit Morning Routine didn’t just launch—it erupted . It started in late March 2025, when fitness influencer Ashton Hall’s eccentric TikTok—complete with early wakeups, banana facials, and ice-cold water slaps—caught fire on X (formerly Twitter). The internet couldn’t stop watching. With more than 667 million views in just four days, it was only a matter of time before crypto pounced. Developers launched ROUTINE on March 21, riding the viral wave and linking the token directly to Hall’s now-famous routine. In only 48 hours, the token’s market cap shot up to $19 million as traders raced in. True to meme coin form, it wasn’t a smooth ride. ROUTINE dropped 57% in hours, hit a low near $8 million, and then exploded back by 88% to reclaim a $15 million cap by Monday. Over 100 early movers made more than $10,000 each. The coin’s story became a case study in how fast culture and crypto can collide—and create real profits. ROUTINE proved one thing: virality still moves markets. But while it sparked a flash, Dragoin is preparing to deliver something far more lasting—and potentially far more lucrative. Dragoin Is Gaining Fast—And It’s Built to Last While ROUTINE rides a wave of instant fame, Dragoin ($DDGN) is building a foundation that could carry it for the long run. It’s not just riding the meme wave—it’s upgrading it. Dragoin is a play-to-earn token with a real product, a strong roadmap, and a tokenomics model that’s built for those who want big upside and utility. Running on Ethereum, Dragoin has 200 billion tokens—half of which are allocated to a 25-stage presale that’s already heating up. Prices increase with every stage, rewarding those who get in early. And the unsold tokens? Gone forever. Burned. This isn’t just another drop—it’s a deflation-powered rocket. The real kicker? Dragoin offers an interactive Telegram game where users hatch, train, and battle dragons to earn $DDGN. It’s fun, addictive, and already pulling users into the ecosystem. With staking, airdrops, referral bonuses, and a plan to renounce the smart contract at launch, Dragoin is ticking all the right boxes—and it’s not even fully live yet. Dragoin’s presale began strongly, offering Stage 1 tokens at only $0.0000292. With a clear roadmap targeting a launch price of $0.002, investors have a golden chance for impressive gains nearing 6,700%. Acting early in the presale secures the best possible price, providing significant upside potential and setting participants up for long-term success. Early entry also strengthens investors’ community status and influence within the Dragoin ecosystem. Why Dragoin Could Be the Meme Coin That Doesn’t Fade ROUTINE reminded everyone how fast memes can turn into money—but Dragoin is showing what comes next. Today’s traders want more than just a meme. They want something they can hold, use, and believe in past the first pump. Dragoin delivers that. With built-in scarcity, community rewards, and real gameplay, it’s creating something most meme coins never do— retention . While ROUTINE and others spike and dip, Dragoin is laying track for something far more sustainable. Its presale progress proves the market is watching. People are buying in before the hype peaks. This is the moment when early decisions could become huge wins. If you’re waiting for the “next big thing,” it might already be in motion. Q2 2025 is shaping up to be the most electric moment for meme coins in years. Morning Routine brought the buzz—but Dragoin is shaping up to bring the real returns. For those who sat out the Dogecoin run, missed Shiba’s breakout, or jumped too late into PEPE or Bonk, Dragoin is the chance to get in early again —but this time, with smarter fundamentals and more long-term potential. With a powerful presale, an actual game, and a roadmap that’s already being executed, Dragoin isn’t just another meme—it’s the one everyone’s going to talk about after it takes off. The question is: will you be in before it does?

Digital platforms that handle transactions, store personal information, or manage digital assets can benefit from blockchain’s ability to improve security and efficiency. E-commerce, social media, financial services, gaming, streaming, and real estate are among the industries that can benefit the most from blockchain technology. Companies are beginning to see its value in making transactions safer, reducing costs, and increasing trust between users and service providers. E-Commerce Platforms: Secure transactions and Fraud Prevention Online shopping has grown quickly, but fraud and security risks continue to cause problems for both buyers and sellers. Many platforms deal with chargebacks, identity theft, and fake products. Blockchain helps by making transactions more secure and easier to verify. Transactions recorded on a blockchain cannot be changed or reversed without permission, which stops chargeback scams and protects sellers from losses. Websites like eBay and AliExpress could use blockchain to support cryptocurrency transactions, making transactions faster and reducing reliance on banks. Some companies, including Shopify and Overstock, have already introduced blockchain-based transactions to improve security and build trust with their customers. Blockchain also helps verify where products come from. By scanning a blockchain-verified code, buyers can check if a product is real and track its journey from the manufacturer to their hands. This is useful for high-end goods and electronics, where counterfeit items are a common issue. Gaming Platforms: Fairness, Security, and Digital Ownership More gaming platforms are starting to use blockchain to improve security and make sure digital transactions are fair. Many online games now have systems where players can buy, sell, or trade virtual items. Blockchain helps by making these transactions more secure and allowing players to fully own their digital assets without the risk of them being changed or taken away. This technology is useful beyond gaming as well. Online learning platforms, virtual workspaces, and creative tools also benefit from better security and verified ownership of digital content. By using blockchain, these platforms can protect user data and ensure that digital records cannot be altered. Online casino platforms have started exploring blockchain technology to improve different aspects of their services. The rise in popularity of games such as slots has led to more people signing up, which means their personal data will need better protection. By integrating blockchain, online casino platforms can address security concerns, improve transaction efficiency, and offer transparency in game outcomes. This technology provides a way to maintain fair operations while giving users a verifiable record of their activity. Social Media Platforms: Data Privacy and Content Ownership Social media platforms store a lot of personal data, which makes them a common target for hackers. Many people are concerned about how their information is used and if outsiders can access it without permission. Blockchain can make social media safer by giving users control over their own data instead of leaving it in the hands of big companies. With blockchain-based social media, posts, messages, and personal details could be encrypted and stored across a secure network rather than kept on company-owned servers. This would make it harder for hackers to steal information and reduce the risk of large-scale data breaches. Platforms like Facebook, X, and Instagram have faced criticism for privacy concerns, while newer platforms like Minds and Mastodon are exploring blockchain-based alternatives that give users more control over their data. Fake accounts and misinformation are other problems that blockchain could help solve. By using a verification system built on blockchain, social media platforms could confirm that users are real people rather than bots or fraudulent accounts. This would help reduce spam, fake news, and manipulated engagement. Streaming Platforms: Content Protection and Royalty Transactions Streaming platforms for music, movies, and online courses often face problems with content ownership and making sure artists and creators get paid fairly. Blockchain can help by using smart contracts that automatically send transactions to creators whenever their content is accessed. With blockchain, streaming platforms like Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube could track exactly how many times a song, film, or online lesson is played and send transactions directly to the creator without needing a third party to process them. Some music platforms, like Audius, are already using blockchain to give artists more control over their earnings. Blockchain also helps stop unauthorized copies from spreading. When a song, movie, or course is registered on a blockchain, its ownership is recorded in a way that cannot be changed.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-28 01:02:48

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is standing out with its innovative presale strategy and deflationary token model, attracting early investors eager for massive returns. APC’s weekly token burns and lucrative referral rewards create a strong foundation for long-term value growth. Meanwhile, Toshi and Book of Meme are also making headlines, with increasing market traction and impressive trading volumes. Arctic Pablo Coin is on the list of Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. These projects are redefining the meme coin space, offering more than just hype—they bring unique community engagement and strategic growth plans. This article will dive into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Toshi, and Book of Meme, with a special focus on the presale excitement surrounding APC and why it could be the next big crypto success. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Strategy: Boosting Scarcity and Value Scarcity drives value in cryptocurrency, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is leveraging this principle with an aggressive token burn mechanism. Unsold tokens during the presale are permanently eliminated every week, ensuring that supply remains controlled. Additionally, once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment designed to enhance long-term value. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin integrates a transparent burn strategy recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring all transactions remain verifiable. Arctic Pablo Coin is on the list of Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. By reducing the overall supply over time, this mechanism aims to strengthen APC’s market potential and provide long-term sustainability for investors. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale at Crystal Cove: A Golden Entry Point Before Prices Rise The Meme Coin presale has now reached Crystal Cove, the 16th phase of its journey, marking an exciting milestone for early investors. At this stage, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000083, offering an attractive entry point before prices surge. With the launch price set at $0.008, early investors have the potential to achieve a staggering 9,552.41% ROI. To put this into perspective, an investment of $1,000 today would secure approximately 12,048,190 APC tokens, which could skyrocket to $96,385.52 upon listing. With over $2 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin continues to gain momentum, drawing in both retail and institutional investors. As APC progresses through new locations, the token price is expected to rise. The presale offers a rare chance to enter at a low price before the next phase increases costs, making this a limited-time investment opportunity for those looking to maximize their returns. Toshi’s Market Performance: Growing Market Cap and Strong Trading Volume Toshi has been making waves in the crypto market, currently trading at $0.000337 per token (TOSHI/USD) with a market capitalization of $137.54 million. Its 24-hour trading volume of $14.66 million highlights strong investor interest and market engagement. What sets Toshi apart is its unique blend of meme culture and crypto fundamentals, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The project’s strong community support, coupled with consistent market performance, has contributed to its increasing popularity. As meme coins continue to evolve beyond speculation, Toshi’s growing adoption and trading activity position it as a serious contender in the space. With its expanding ecosystem and rising demand, Toshi is proving to be more than just another meme token—it’s a project with lasting potential. Book of Meme’s Trading Volume Surges, Driving Investor Interest Another meme coin making waves in the crypto space is Book of Meme (BOME), currently trading at $0.001569. What’s fueling its rise? A 24-hour trading volume of $161.94 million showcases massive investor interest and growing market demand. Book of Meme isn’t just riding the meme coin hype—it’s carving out a unique niche by blending internet culture with blockchain innovation. With such high trading volumes, the token continues to solidify its position as a top-performing meme coin, attracting both short-term traders seeking volatility and long-term investors who believe in its potential. As the meme coin sector expands, Book of Meme’s strong market performance and rising adoption make it a project to watch for those looking to capitalize on the next big crypto trend. Final Words: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge in the Meme Coin Frenzy The meme coin market is buzzing with action, with Arctic Pablo Coin, Toshi, and Book of Meme each offering unique opportunities for investors. Arctic Pablo Coin, however, stands out due to its strategic token burn mechanism and presale structure, which has already raised over $2 million.

Musk stated that his Department of Government Efficiency is set to achieve these savings within 130 days from the start of Trump’s term on January 20. Musk explained that the plan would involve cutting more than half of the $1.8 trillion spent on non-defense discretionary programs in 2024. “I think we will accomplish most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that time frame,” he said. The billionaire added that his aim is to cut 15% of the government’s annual spending, which totaled $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He confidently said that these reductions could be made without affecting any of the critical government services. Musk, classified as a special government employee who is allowed to work only 130 days out of the year as a temporary federal worker, spoke of a sweeping reform effort. DOGE is still far from reaching the $1 trillion target The interview came just days after President Trump said he expected to be “satisfied” with DOGE’s cuts in the coming month or two. Trump acknowledged that the overhauls led by DOGE are not “necessarily a very popular thing to do,” noting the political risks tied to such wide-ranging cuts. Most of the federal government’s spending is allocated to mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security, where there is little room for reductions. Musk has claimed that these programs are overrun with fraud and waste, though he did not provide supporting evidence for these assertions.In response, DOGE has deployed at least 10 staffers to the Social Security Administration to identify waste. However, data shows that from 2015 through 2022, Social Security estimated nearly $72 billion in improper payments, which makes less than 1% of benefits paid, according to an inspector general report from last year. The DOGE website, which has been criticized for errors and overstatements, currently lists about $22 billion in contract savings. The website also claims about $130 billion in overall cost reductions, although these figures are not itemized. Musk has downplayed the effect of job cuts Musk’s DOGE has also pushed a series of federal government layoffs that have been implemented in the past few weeks. While several agencies have announced workforce reductions, Musk dismissed the impact of these job cuts by saying that “almost no one’s gotten fired.” Among the recent changes, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a cut of 10,000 jobs earlier on Thursday. In March the Education Department stated that it was reducing its workforce by half. Moreover, the Small Business Administration is cutting 43% of its workforce. The Department of Veterans Affairs has announced plans to layoff 80,000 workers, while the Treasury Department shared major cuts planned in a court filing. DOGE’s efforts have also faced legal hurdles. This includes judges rejecting some of the proposed cuts and blocking Musk’s team from accessing certain systems and databases such as those at the Social Security Administration.

In a statement on Thursday, Crypto.com confirmed that the SEC would not be pursuing any enforcement action against the company. The SEC has yet to respond to requests for comment. Under the previous administration, the SEC weaponized and attempted to expand its congressionally granted power to harm an industry that its former chair disfavored, according to Crypto.com Chief Legal Officer Nick Lundgren. He added that it was unfortunate they had to endure a years-long investigation and file their own lawsuit against the SEC to protect the rule of law. The SEC has recently dismissed multiple investigations and lawsuits against crypto firms, including those involving Kraken and Coinbase. Earlier this month, the agency also opted to drop its appeal in the case against Ripple. Crypto.com’s legal battle and the SEC’s changing stance on crypto regulation Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October after receiving a Wells notice, signalling the potential for charges. In its lawsuit, Crypto.com argued that the SEC had overreached its jurisdiction and challenged the agency’s stance that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. That lawsuit was dropped in December. The regulatory watchdog has changed significantly over the past several weeks following the beginning of the Trump administration and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s exit at the beginning of the year. Since the year began, the SEC has rescinded controversial crypto accounting guidance, dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players and formed a crypto task force. Additionally, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s pick for the SEC chairmanship, Paul Atkins, faced questions from lawmakers about the agency’s past actions and his ties to bankrupt FTX. Atkins said he planned to make creating a regulatory framework for digital assets a “top priority.” According to its statement, Crypto.com serves more than 140 million customers worldwide. In a notable development, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. announced earlier this week that it had signed a non-binding agreement with Crypto.com to collaborate on launching a range of exchange-traded funds and products under the Truth.Fi fintech brand. SEC drops multiple crypto cases, but some firms still face uncertainty In the fewer than three months since U.S. President Donald Trump took office, the SEC’s investigations into crypto exchange Gemini, trading platform Robinhood, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, NFT company Yuga Labs, and Immutable, and now Crypto.com have all been dropped, with no enforcement charges filed. The agency’s litigation against crypto companies, including Kraken, Coinbase, ConsenSys, Ripple, and Cumberland DRW, has also been dropped. Still, more litigation has been paused, including the SEC’s cases against Tron and Binance. But, not everyone who received a Wells notice is off the SEC’s hook yet. Crypto issuer Unicoin received a Wells notice last year informing the firm that the SEC planned to bring charges alleging violations related to fraud, deceptive practices and the offer and sale of unregistered securities. A spokesperson for Unicoin recently said that the firm “remains in the final stages of the SEC review process. The spokesperson noted: “As of now, we have not received any new updates or formal feedback from the SEC regarding our registration. We are fully committed to compliance and transparency, and we continue to work toward securing the necessary approvals for our planned offerings.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Attributes such as initial progress, expanding supporter bases, or significant advancements on the horizon, some ventures are distinguishing themselves. XRP, BlockDAG, Aptos, and Celestia have all garnered attention for various reasons, and not solely from the typical audience. As the cryptocurrency market evolves and new challengers emerge, these four merit close observation. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Substantial Expansion, Vast Return Possibilities BlockDAG (BDAG) is an advanced Layer 1 protocol engineered for extensive scalability. Contrary to conventional blockchains that decelerate under load, it utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture to execute transactions concurrently—enhancing speed without compromising efficiency. This structure is optimal for supporting a wide range of applications from DeFi to gaming and financial transactions. Beyond theoretical advantages—concrete figures support this. BlockDAG has successfully secured over $207 million in its presale phase, distributed over 18.9 billion coins, and achieved a price increase from $0.001 to $0.0248—marking a 2,380% rise in just 27 batches. The real intrigue lies in the projected long-term gains. With current progress and ecosystem growth, analysts predict up to a 30,000x ROI for early participants. This projection has attracted over 170,000 unique holders, with significant events such as the mainnet launch and numerous exchange listings forthcoming. For those evaluating their options and seeking the best long term crypto for higher returns, BlockDAG presents a compelling combination of robust fundamentals and potential for expansion. This isn”t just speculation—it’s a momentum supported by tangible achievements. 2. XRP (XRP): Momentum Builds as Legal Hurdles Clear XRP is renowned for its ability to accelerate international payments—completing transactions in just seconds at low costs. It ranks as one of the leading altcoins with a market cap of $13 billion. The lengthy SEC lawsuit that cast doubt on its future has concluded, clearing significant obstacles. Since the case closed, XRP has maintained a stable price around $2.39, with optimistic forecasts suggesting a rise to between $5 and $100 in future years. While these predictions are speculative, the newfound legal clarity might attract renewed interest. For those searching for the best long-term crypto for higher returns, XRP now faces fewer obstacles. 3. Aptos (APT): Is Speed the Key to Its Value Over Time? Aptos boasts a high-speed blockchain, capable of processing up to 160,000 transactions per second with parallel execution. Developed using the Move language and supported by a Proof-of-Stake consensus, it’s rapidly becoming the go-to platform for developers creating scalable dApps. Aptos has recently reached about 15 million monthly users and ranks as the fourth-largest blockchain by daily transactions. Its current price is approximately $5.45, with future values potentially reaching between $26 and over $100 by 2030. For those looking at the best long-term crypto for higher returns, Aptos offers robust technical foundations paired with increasing practical application. 4. Celestia (TIA): Promising Potential for Sustained Gains Celestia (TIA) introduces a modular approach to blockchain by separating data availability from execution, thus improving scalability. The TIA token supports the network’s proof-of-stake mechanism, allowing users to stake tokens with validators for rewards. Developers use TIA for data storage costs within Celestia’s unique blobspace, enhancing roll-up operations without separate gas tokens. Currently, TIA trades at about $3.31, with predictions for 2025 ranging from $7.81 to $14.23, and by 2030, potentially hitting up to $47.47. For those seeking the best long-term crypto for higher returns, Celestia’s groundbreaking structure and tokenomics offer an attractive prospect. The Bottom Line These altcoins each present unique strengths—XRP with its transaction speed and clear legal status, Aptos with its scalable technology, and Celestia with its modern blockchain design. Yet, BlockDAG leads the pack for various reasons. BlockDAG isn’t just capitalizing on initial buzz—the data already indicates significant progress, and the potential for substantial growth is undeniable. With consistent price increases and a forecasted 30,000x ROI, BlockDAG stands out as a top choice for the best long term crypto for higher returns. The opportunity is narrowing, suggesting now might be the time to consider BDAG at current levels.

The strong rebound follows a brutal correction in which AVAX lost over 72% of its value since mid-December 2024, triggering widespread capitulation and fear across the market. Now, with price action showing signs of strength, investors are cautiously optimistic — but uncertainty remains.

Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, pointing out that the TD Sequential indicator is now presenting a fresh sell signal. This suggests that AVAX may be due for a short-term pullback or a period of sideways movement. With the broader market still under pressure, traders are watching closely to see whether Avalanche can maintain its gains or lose momentum. Avalanche Wakes Up But Faces Serious Risks Avalanche is showing signs of life after enduring months of intense selling pressure. Like many altcoins, AVAX has been heavily impacted by macroeconomic volatility, losing over 70% of its value since mid-December 2024. Now, as bullish momentum begins to return across select altcoins, Avalanche is attempting to stage a recovery rally. The recent 53% surge since March 11 has revived hopes that AVAX could be ready to break out — but headwinds still remain. The broader market environment continues to be shaped by uncertainty. Trade war fears and unstable macroeconomic signals have kept pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Many investors remain cautious and are still offloading positions near current levels, concerned about the long-term direction of the market. While momentum is returning to some sectors, the path for Avalanche is far from clear. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a technical development using the TD Sequential indicator. After accurately calling the recent bottom and a 50% rally in AVAX, the indicator is now flashing a sell signal. This suggests that Avalanche could be due for a short-term retrace or period of consolidation before any further move higher. The $22 level remains a crucial resistance zone for AVAX. A temporary cooldown here may be healthy — giving bulls time to regroup before attempting a breakout. If AVAX can hold key support and reset after the current rally, it could build a stronger foundation for a decisive push above $22 in the weeks ahead. For now, all eyes are on price action as Avalanche balances between correction and continuation in a market still clouded by uncertainty.

The recent pullback reflects cooling momentum as bulls struggle to maintain pressure near short-term resistance. Still, the trend remains intact — for now. To sustain the recovery rally, bulls must defend current levels and push toward reclaiming the $30 mark, which aligns with the 200-day moving average (MA) and 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). A successful breakout above this zone would be a strong bullish signal and could mark the beginning of a larger uptrend. However, failure to hold above $20 in the coming days would be a warning sign. A breakdown below this level could trigger increased selling pressure and send AVAX back toward the $17 zone — a key support area from previous consolidations. As Avalanche continues to trade within a volatile range, the next few sessions will be crucial in determining short-term direction.

A decisive move above $30 remains the target, but holding the $20 level is just as important to avoid a deeper retrace and renewed bearish sentiment.

He pointed out that there was no strong conviction yet to ‘play Europe over the US over the next six-to-12 months’. Boivin predicted that the U.S. would see the strongest earnings growth within the coming six-to-12 months. The strategist said a 10% tariff was likely the best possible landing zone, and the US can adjust to that. However, he cautioned that the tariffs would be a ‘different story’ if they exceeded 10%. Charlie Bilello, the chief market strategist at Creative Planning, also said that U.S. stocks had been outperforming international stocks by a big margin for 16 years running. According to Bilello, the U.S. was now more than three standard deviations above the mean in terms of historical outperformance. Boivin favors U.S. stocks over European equities US equities will soon regain their long-held edge over European peers, according to Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute https://t.co/ulgY1BnrSr — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 27, 2025 Boivin said US equities will soon regain their long-held edge over European stocks, as the future of European stocks was limited to sectors such as defense and banks. He added that he expected U.S. earnings downgrades to be short-lived as tariff-related uncertainty came to an end. However, UBS’s chief strategist Bhanu Baweja said this week he expected the S&P 500 to drop another 8% as a consumer slowdown continued to squeeze corporate earnings. Keith Lerner, the Co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Market Strategist at Truist Advisory Services, also said the US outperformed Europe by 20% since December, but markets did not move in straight lines. He pointed out that Europe’s defense-driven rally may pause, while US fiscal stimulus offered short-term opportunities. “The US is the place where we expect to see the strongest earnings growth on a six-to-12 month horizon.” – Jean Boivin As per Reuters reports on March 27th, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 20.71 points or 0.05% to 42,478.39, the S&P 500 (.SPX) climbed 6.42 points or 0.12% to 5,718.66, and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) advanced 21.25 points or 0.09% to 17,920.27. Meanwhile, European stocks fell, with weakness in shares of Europe’s top carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) down nearly 2%, BMW (BMWG.DE) losing almost 3%, and Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) sliding more than 4%. U.S. economy has grown faster than expected since the end of 2024 A Commerce Department report on March 27th revealed that the U.S. economy grew a little faster than expected in the final three months of 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also said in its last of three estimates that the U.S. GDP accelerated at a 2.4% pace for the October-through-December period. That was 0.2 percentage points ahead of the previous estimate and came from an upward revision to consumer spending, which grew at a 4% rate in the fourth quarter. In addition to the upward change in GDP, the BEA noted that core inflation was a bit softer than previously indicated. The personal consumption expenditures price index (excluding food and energy prices), which the Federal Reserve uses as its primary inflation gauge, increased by 2.6%, down 0.1 percentage points from the prior estimate. CNBC also reported that the major indexes were clinging to marginal gains as stocks flitted between gains and losses this week. The S&P 500 ticked up nearly 0.8%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.5%. The 30-stock Dow has also added 1% this week thus far. Within the S&P 500 sectors, communication services, consumer discretionary, and financials saw the largest gains, whereas utilities, health care, and real estate were the main decliners. However, sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose in February, recovering from a drop in January. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of the first to take part in the trend, posting a portrait of himself generated by the model on March 25 but said in a subsequent post two days later that all image requests have started to tax the firm’s infrastructure. “It’s super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT but our GPUs are melting. We are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient,” he said. Source: Sam Altman “Also, we are refusing some generations that should be allowed; we are fixing these as fast we can,” he added. OpenAI launched the upgraded image generation offering in ChatGPT-4o on March 25, resulting in users splashing images across social media in the art style of Studio Ghibli — known for its anime films Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro . Altman didn’t give a definitive timeline on how long the rate limits would last but said, “Hopefully, it won’t be long! ChatGPT free tier will get three generations per day soon.” Rate limits are generally applied to help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure, according to OpenAI. Related: Ghibli memecoins surge as internet flooded with Studio Ghibli-style AI images “If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users,” OpenAI says on its rate limit explanation page. Along with the legions of others getting in on the trend, X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared an image mimicking King Mufasa from Disney’s The Lion King holding up a Shiba Inu. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks also joined in, using the Studio Ghibli-art style on an image of himself at an event. Source: David Sacks Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported on March 26 that OpenAI expects to more than triple its revenue this year to $12.7 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter. Altman said on Feb. 12 his firm wants to ship GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the coming weeks or months.

That future is unfolding right now with Qubetics, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI), and Quant. Each of these projects is pushing blockchain technology into uncharted territories, solving critical inefficiencies in digital finance and beyond. Qubetics is leading the best penny crypto to buy and charge with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Meanwhile, ASI’s groundbreaking SQD XSpaces upgrade is redefining AI-driven blockchain automation. Quant continues its mission to enhance blockchain interoperability, partnering with Oracle to revolutionize digital assets. Qubetics: The Best Penny Crypto to Buy in 2025 Qubetics is a next-generation blockchain project designed to tokenize real-world assets, making them tradable, accessible, and liquid. Through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, physical and financial assets can be digitized and exchanged securely, removing barriers that have long restricted asset ownership to select entities. Imagine a scenario where a property owner wants to liquidate assets without selling the entire property. Through Qubetics, they can tokenize their real estate, allowing fractional ownership while maintaining control over their property. Similarly, businesses can tokenize high-value assets like intellectual property, machinery, or fine art, providing instant liquidity without traditional banking restrictions. With Qubetics ($TICS) currently priced at $0.1300 in its crypto presale , even a modest $100 investment secures around 769 tokens. Based on the latest stats—over $15.5 million raised, 504 million $TICS tokens sold, and a rapidly expanding base of 23,900+ holders—the project’s momentum is undeniable, one of the best penny crypto to buy. Now, consider the potential: if $TICS reaches just $1, that $100 turns into $769. At $5, it climbs to $3,845. Push it to $10, and you’re looking at $7,690. But if $TICS hits $15, that small $100 outlay could explode into a staggering $11,535, representing a potential 11,437% ROI. In a market where many projects still lack direction or utility, Qubetics stands out as a presale delivering both numbers and real-world impact. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI): AI & Blockchain Innovation ASI is rapidly gaining attention in the AI-blockchain sector, especially with the rollout of the SQD XSpaces upgrade, which introduces cutting-edge enhancements in smart contract security, AI-assisted trading, and DeFi automation. This technological leap positions ASI at the forefront of AI-driven blockchain ecosystems. Another major milestone is the ASI token merger, which consolidates SingularityNET (AGIX) and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) into Fetch.ai’s FET token. This strategic unification is designed to streamline interoperability and operational efficiency, creating a cohesive infrastructure for AI-based decentralized applications. In terms of market activity, FET is currently priced at $0.556269, with a 24-hour trading volume of $112.19 million. Despite a 4.11% dip in the past 24 hours, the momentum surrounding ASI’s developments suggests growing market confidence in its long-term vision. Quant: The Powerhouse of Blockchain Interoperability Quant continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain interoperability, especially as it bridges the gap between decentralized systems and traditional finance. Its recent partnership with Oracle marks a pivotal advancement—integrating Overledger technology into Oracle’s blockchain infrastructure to enable frictionless cross-chain transactions across enterprise environments. Quant’s growing influence is further highlighted by its participation in Project Rosalind, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative led by the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub and the Bank of England. This involvement underscores Quant’s commitment to shaping the future of digital finance at an institutional level. On the market front, QNT is trading at $77.66, with a 24-hour volume of $19.93 million, reflecting a 2.54% decline in the last 24 hours. Despite the dip, Quant’s integration with major financial entities signals strong long-term utility and resilience. The Future of Blockchain: Qubetics, ASI, & Quant Blockchain technology is undergoing a major transformation. Qubetics is revolutionizing real-world asset tokenization, ASI is pioneering AI-powered automation, and Quant is breaking down blockchain barriers. For those looking for projects with real utility, Qubetics stands out as the best penny crypto to buy in 2025. With its explosive presale performance, Qubetics is proving to be more than just another token—it’s an entirely new financial infrastructure. Those who recognize its potential now are positioning themselves ahead of the next major shift in blockchain technology.

Bpifrance said in a March 27 press release that it would back newly formed projects “with a strong French footprint” where it will receive tokens in return for its investment and will look to fund decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, tokenization and artificial intelligence. It added that the plan, supported by the French Ministry of Economy and Finance, was to “promote emerging technologies and strengthen the French blockchain ecosystem.” The global blockchain ecosystem is “currently booming” but the number of French funds taking part is still very limited, it said. French digital and AI minister Clara Chappaz said public and private financing was “one of the keys to the sustainable positioning of our ecosystem on the international stage.” Bpifrance deputy CEO Arnaud Caudoux said that it was convinced of the growing importance that blockchain companies “will take on in the years to come and want to increase French competitiveness and presence in the digital assets field.” “The US is really accelerating its own crypto strategy, so this is all the more important,” Caudoux said at a press conference, as reported by Reuters. He added that Bpifrance had started to support crypto before the US started its own pro-crypto moves. Bpifrance’s headquarters in Paris. Source: Google The bank said it had backed the blockchain sector for a decade and had invested over 150 million euros ($162 million), notably helping to finance the crypto hardware wallet company Ledger in 2014. Bpifrance said it began testing limited investments through tokens in 2022, including a deal with the DeFi lending platform Morpho to buy its token — which has grown to be the 12th largest protocol by value at $3.24 billion, according to DefiLlama.

A portion of the token supply is usually immediately given to select public users in order to drum up liquidity, which can cause token values to slide if they cash out.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal describes the dismissal of the staking lawsuit as the falling of dominoes, eyeing more states to toe the same line. South Carolina Terminates Staking Lawsuit After nearly two years, South Carolina is changing its stance on Coinbase staking. According to an announcement , South Carolina is ditching its lawsuit against the exchange regarding the provision of staking services to users. Going forward, Coinbase says it will begin rolling out staking services for South Carolina residents. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal notes that the exchange is keen on putting a torrid two-year period behind it and relaunching staking services. According to Grewal, South Carolina residents have lost nearly $2 million in staking rewards following the legal battle. Carolina joins a growing number of states to reverse their stance on Coinbase staking. “This is not just a victory for us, but for American consumers and we hope it’s a sign of things to come in the few states left that restrict staking,” said Grewal. US authorities have softened their stance on staking with industry giants like CBOE filing for staking in Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF. Coinbase Enjoys A String Of Regulatory Victories Coinbase is on a red-hot streak of regulatory victories in recent weeks. At the top of the pile is the SEC’s dismissal of its lawsuit against Coinbase without prejudice, triggering excitement. Coinbase has filed an FOIA request against the SEC to probe the financials of its regulatory actions against the industry. Meanwhile, the exchange is pursuing similar information discovery against the FDIC with Grewal criticizing the handling of the FOIA request. The top exchange has set up shop in India after a two-year hiatus, clinching approval from local regulators. Coinbase acquisition of Deribit is considered a major move in the ecosystem claims of self-centric motives over the exchange’s silence in Ripple’s case have soured sentiments.

BTC is now consolidating and might aim for a move above the $88,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a fresh recovery wave above the $86,800 zone. The price is trading below $87,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $88,000 and $88,200 levels. Bitcoin Price Faces Key Resistance Bitcoin price remained stable above the $85,500 level. BTC formed a base and recently started a recovery wave above the $86,500 resistance level. The bulls pushed the price above the $87,200 resistance level. There was even a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $88,260 swing high to the $85,852 swing low. However, the bears seem to be active below the $88,000 level. Bitcoin price is now trading below $87,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average .

The first key resistance is near the $88,000 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $88,250. A close above the $88,250 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $88,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $90,000 level or even $90,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $88,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $86,800 level. The first major support is near the $86,400 level. The next support is now near the $85,850 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $85,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $84,500.

Presales offer investors an opportunity to buy in at a fixed and discounted rate, therefore maximizing upside potential. These presale events can provide substantial gains in bullish periods like the one we’re currently entering. With that in mind, here are the five best crypto presales to buy now: Solaxy Solaxy is working toward a new era for Solana, building its first-ever layer 2 blockchain. It uses off-chain computation and transaction bundling technology to tackle Solana’s congestion issue, which it has grappled with for years. With over $27 million raised, Solaxy’s presale success reflects the market’s trust. The project will make Solana cheaper, faster, and more scalable. This will, in effect, open Solana to new use cases and expand its current ones, such as meme coins, AI, and DeFi. Given that Solana is worth over $65 billion, the potential impact that Solaxy could make creates a massive opportunity for the $SOLX token to rise in price. It’s clear that investors are well aware of this potential, given the project’s presale momentum. Therefore, prospective investors hoping to get in early should act quickly. Visit Solaxy Presale BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token is a Bitcoin-themed meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. But it isn’t just a meme coin – it’s the first cryptocurrency to pay its community Bitcoin rewards. It’s a setup that economically aligns the performance of BTC Bull Token with that of Bitcoin. The higher Bitcoin’s price goes, the more valuable BTC Bull Token rewards become. The project will pay Bitcoin and BTC Bull Token rewards to holders at key milestones on Bitcoin’s journey to $1 million – starting when it hits $100K. As Bitcoin rises, it tends to drag the rest of the market up with it. Therefore, BTC Bull Token holders will simultaneously benefit from price appreciation and a growing position of $BTC and $BTCBULL. There are also staking and burning mechanisms to help boost the project’s supply and demand dynamics. The $BTCBULL presale has raised $4 million so far. By aligning meme coin virality with Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, BTC Bull Token is one of the most promising presales on the market. Visit BTC Bull Token Presale MIND Of Pepe MIND Of Pepe is a Pepe-themed AI agent operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The project grasps the current market dynamics while also positioning for the future. The meme coin market is thriving right now, but it seems that the AI agent sector is also making a comeback. It saw a huge boom in December and is now waking up again, with its trading volume jumping 24% today. As the next AI agent rally approaches, MIND Of Pepe is set for considerable success. The project will identify trading opportunities and share them with $MIND holders. It can also launch tokens and interact with dApps, all for the betterment of the community. Moreover, the agent introduces a technology called “hive mind analysis,” which allows it to learn from the data it collects and become more powerful over time. The presale has raised $7.5 million so far. By blending the allure of Pepe coin with cutting-edge AI utility, MIND Of Pepe separates itself from other meme coins and AI agents on the market. Visit MIND Of Pepe Presale Best Wallet Token Best Wallet token is the new cryptocurrency that will power multichain crypto wallet Best Wallet. The wallet is packed with features to make life easier when trading on-chain. However, one of its main pillars is Upcoming Tokens, a presale aggregator that allows users to buy promising new presales directly from the app. Some previous projects listed on Upcoming Tokens, such as Pepe Unchained and Catslap, provided investors with gains of between 10x and 50x. Best Wallet also offers a cross-chain DEX, a crypto debit card, a staking aggregator, derivatives trading, and much more. The $BEST token provides trading fee discounts, higher staking yields, governance rights, and access to promotions on partner projects. So far, the $BEST presale has raised $11.3 million, illustrating strong demand. But with $BEST allowing users to save money and gain new opportunities, there’s every chance its demand continues to soar as the wallet gains more eyeballs, giving it serious price potential. Visit Best Wallet Token Presale Meme Index Every day, new meme coins emerge, and early traders get rich. But with projects launching all the time, it’s hard to keep track. While it can be highly lucrative, meme coin trading is also risky. Meme Index understands this and provides a solution. It’s building the world’s first decentralized meme coin index investing app. These indexes are like meme-styled ETFs. They contain a range of different meme coins. Buying the index gives price exposure to them all, spreading risk and increasing the chances of catching a winner. Four indexes are available, each with a different level of volatility and risk. This means there’s something for all investors. Like Best Wallet token, utility is at the heart of $MEMEX. Users must hold it to access the platform, and it also provides governance and staking rights. Meme Index could change how investors trade meme coins, and if it does, there will be massive demand for $MEMEX. Visit Meme Index Presale Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

The new proposal — made by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in a Technical Advice report to the European Commission on March 27 — would set a far stricter standard than other asset classes, such as stocks and real estate, which don’t even need to be half-backed. “EIOPA considers a 100% haircut in the standard formula prudent and appropriate for these assets in view of their inherent risks and high volatility,” it said in a separate statement. Such a measure would fill a regulatory gap between the Capital Requirements Regulation and Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), EIOPA said, noting that the European Union’s regulatory framework for insurers currently lacks specific provisions on crypto assets. Circle argued in January that a blanket 100% stress factor on crypto assets didn’t account for lower-risk stablecoins. Source: Circle EIOPA outlined four options for the European Commission to consider — one: make no changes; two: mandate an 80% “stress level” to crypto assets; and three: mandate a 100% stress level to crypto asset. The stress level percentages determine how much capital firms need to hold to stay solvent. The fourth option called on the European Commission to consider the risks of tokenized assets more broadly. EIOPA said option three would be the most appropriate option. “An 80% stress to the value of crypto-asset exposures does not appear sufficiently prudent,” whereas “a 100% stress is more appropriate and aligns with one of the approaches to the transitional treatment of crypto-assets under CRR,” EIOPA said. The 100% stress refers to the assumption that the crypto asset prices could fall by 100% and that diversification — spreading the risk across different assets — wouldn’t not reduce this stress. EIOPA pointed out that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) have fallen 82% and 91%, respectively, in the past. A 100% capital charge for crypto assets would reflect a far stricter approach compared to stocks, which range between 39% and 49%, and real estate, which incurs a 25% capital charge, according to solvency capital requirements laid out in the Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. EIOPA said a 100% capital charge for crypto asset-related (re)insurance undertakings shouldn’t be “overly burdensome” and that there would be no material costs for policyholders. “The capital requirements would fully capture the risk of crypto-asset with a positive impact on policyholder protection in case there are material exposures in the future.” Related: Tabit offers USD insurance policies backed by Bitcoin regulatory capital EIOPA acknowledged that the share of crypto-asset (re)insurance undertakings accounts for just 655 million euros or 0.0068% of all undertakings in Europe — even referring to it as “immaterial.” “At the same time crypto assets are high risk investments which may result in total loss of value,” EIOPA said, explaining why it recommends option three. Luxembourg and Sweden could be hit hardest by the proposed rule Insurers in Luxembourg and Sweden are likely to be the most affected, according to a Q4 2023 report cited by EIOPA, which found that these two countries accounted for 69% and 21% of all crypto asset-related exposures among (re)insurance undertakings. Ireland, Denmark and Liechtenstein also accounted for 3.4%, 1.4% and 1.2% of the undertakings. Most of these undertakings are structured within funds, such as exchange-traded funds, and held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders, EIOPA noted.

One minute they’re mooning, the next minute you’re wondering where your investment went. But lately, two coins have been stirring up the crypto scene: Slerf—with its explosive presale saga and ongoing refund frenzy, and Simon’s Cat—dropping a new mobile game and clawing its way up the charts. While both are making noise, there’s one coin quietly locking down the throne with cold-hard numbers among the top new meme coins to join today: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Let’s be real—presales are the crypto investor’s haven. No wild price swings, no rug-pull panic, and most importantly, massive upside potential. And BTFD isn’t just riding the wave—it’s building the damn ocean. From a fully functional P2E game and 90% staking APY to the unmatched community power of the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin is lighting up presale charts and making early buyers feel like they’ve struck digital gold. Want in? Keep reading—because these are the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Can the Bulls Squad Deliver 2900% ROI and 100% Bonus? What happens when you take a market meme like “ Buy The Dip ” and turn it into a full-blown movement? You get BTFD Coin—a presale powerhouse backed by a die-hard community called the Bulls Squad. These aren’t just token holders; they’re a movement. Led by mascots like Baby Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Raging Bull, this squad’s mission is simple: stack dips, ride the next bull run, and laugh all the way to the bank. Now in its 15th stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.0002. And with one final stage to go, time is ticking. Over 72 billion coins have already been sold, with $6.42 million raised and more than 11,600 wallet holders. The listing price? $0.0006. That’s a clean 200% ROI just for showing up early. But the real kicker? Analysts believe $BTFD could reach a moon price of $0.006—a jaw-dropping 2900% return from today’s presale level. Let’s run some numbers: if you throw $1500 into the current presale price ($0.0002), you get 7.5 million BTFD tokens. Apply the LAUNCH100 code and you’ll get double that—15 million tokens. If BTFD hits $0.0006, that’s $9,000. And if it reaches the projected moonshot of $0.006, you’re looking at $90,000. All from a $1500 play. Wild, right? Hey Bulls, major announcement your way: BTFD is offering a one-time 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100). Buy now in Stage 15 and your tokens will be DOUBLED. That’s twice the gains. But here’s the twist—this offer disappears after March 30. So if you’ve ever wanted to flex on your crypto group chat, now’s your shot with the top new meme coin to join today. This isn’t just about buying low—it’s about staking smart too. With meme coin presale staking at 90% APY, BTFD Coin lets you double dip: get coins, stake them, and earn even more while chilling with the Bulls. The game’s already live, the staking is real, and the hype is snowballing. Want to grab your BTFD stash? 1: Go to BTFD Presale . 2: Connect your wallet. 3: Enter code LAUNCH100 (all caps), hit apply. 4: Choose how much to buy. 5: Hit “Buy Now” and confirm. BTFD Coin Rewards Program: Got friends? Get paid. Share your unique referral code and bag 10% in $BTFD if your code ranks in the top 20. Your referrals even get 10% extra BTFD if they drop $50+. More friends, more coins, more bragging rights. So whether you’re a seasoned whale or a crypto cub, this is your moment. The dip is here with the top new meme coin to join today. The Bulls are ready. BTFD or get left behind. Slerf (SLERF): Refunds, Regrets, and Redemption? Slerf has turned into the wild child of Solana. After accidentally burning $10 million worth of presale funds, most projects would’ve folded. Not Slerf. With a market cap still hovering around $33 million and the price at ~$0.0672, it’s clawing back community trust. The devs are issuing refunds, and waves of volume suggest traders are still watching. It’s volatile, risky, and honestly? Pretty intriguing. If this underdog keeps rebounding, Slerf could remain one of the top new meme coins to join today. Simon’s Cat (CAT): Paws Up, Game On! Who said meme coins can’t be adorable? Simon’s Cat just launched “Simon’s Cat Match,” turning its viral cartoon charm into in-game gains. Trading at ~$0.000008118 with a $56.89 million market cap, CAT’s 24-hour volume just passed $22 million. It’s the purr-fect blend of nostalgia and utility. Analysts even predict it could double in price by the end of 2025. Cute, casual, and quietly climbing—Simon’s Cat is one of the top new meme coins to join today. Conclusion: Which Bag Will You Regret Not Filling? Here’s the cold truth: based on market trends, investor buzz, and cold hard math, BTFD Coin holds the crown. The Bulls Squad is rallying, the 100% bonus LAUNCH100 offer ends March 30, and the 2900% ROI window is wide open right now—but not for long. Slerf’s trying to bounce back, and Simon’s Cat has its claws in the gaming crowd, but if you’re looking for generational wealth vibes, you know where to look. Join the BTFD Coin presale before it disappears into crypto legend. These are the top new meme coins to join today, but only one’s got Bulls backing it to the moon.

Especially with one presale so hot, it’s practically sizzling among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Let’s talk facts. Meme coin markets are exploding again. Bitcoin just brushed against $85,000, ETH’s rally turned heads, and altcoin whispers are turning into roars. But what’s cooking underneath? Meme coins are staging a comeback—with smarter mechanics, stronger communities, and real-world features. And frontlining this surge is BTFD Coin, smashing presale records, building a buzzing Bulls Squad, and dangling a limited 100% bonus offer that’s shaking up Telegram chats like never before. One of the best parts? The LAUNCH100 code that doubles your bag ends March 30, 2025. Miss that, and well… you’ll be watching others moon while you refresh CoinMarketCap with regret. Want in? You better keep reading. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Get 2x Coins, 90% APY Staking, and a Moonshot to $0.006! What if one meme coin presale could triple your returns before it even hits exchanges? That’s not clickbait—it’s BTFD Coin in its final stretch. It’s currently in Stage 15 of its presale, priced at just $0.0002, and there’s only one stage left before it lists at $0.0006. That alone offers a 200% return, but the real gold lies ahead. Let’s play with numbers: invest $4,000 today at $0.0002, and you’ll bag 20 million BTFD coins. Apply the LAUNCH100 code before March 30, and boom—you’re now holding 40 million coins. If BTFD reaches its predicted moonshot of $0.006, that turns into $240,000. That’s a staggering 2900% ROI. Yes, you read that right. And there’s more. BTFD offers staking at 90% APY—yes, 90%! That’s not some locked-away dream; it’s live, and early investors are already compounding their gains. Stake now, and by next year, your BTFD bag could multiply even further—without lifting a finger. The Bulls Squad community is buzzing, the P2E game is fully live, and players are already earning BTFD rewards as they dive through challenges with Baby Bull, Raging Bull, and the rest of the herd. Combine that with the Ethereum-based smart contract, a fixed supply, and token burns on the way—it’s no surprise experts are calling BTFD one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term. This One’s For You — Don’t Miss the 100% Bonus! Right now, BTFD is dropping a bombshell: every token you buy with the code LAUNCH100 will be doubled. This isn’t a drill. This limited BOGO-style deal vanishes on March 30, and it’s the last chance before the presale ends. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus: First, head to the BTFD Presale . Click “Connect Wallet” (MetaMask or Trust Wallet work fine). When you see the bonus field, type in LAUNCH100 (all caps), hit “Apply,” and approve it in your wallet. Now input your purchase amount, click “Buy Now,” and lock in your double reward. And don’t sleep on the referral program—if your code lands in the top 20, you’ll earn 10% of every referred purchase in $BTFD. That’s passive income done right. So why did BTFD make this list? Because it’s got the ingredients meme coin legends are made of: strong utility, viral branding, real community, and ridiculous upside. 2. COQ Inu (COQ) – Avalanche’s Wildest Ride Yet Ever seen a rooster run faster than a cheetah? That’s COQ Inu on the Avalanche chain. Born from memes and driven by raw community power, COQ has become the feathered face of Avalanche’s meme ecosystem. This isn’t just some barnyard banter—it’s pushing volume charts and attracting new traders by the thousands. Its charm lies in simplicity. COQ’s community controls everything, with token burns, liquidity locks, and meme campaigns giving it wings. It’s also taken full advantage of Avalanche’s low-fee and high-speed perks, giving memecoin traders a smoother ride than ever. COQ Inu earned its spot among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term because it’s proof that a loud, fun-loving crowd can drive serious momentum in the right direction. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – OG Meme King Plotting a Comeback? You thought SHIB was done? Think again. The original “Dogecoin killer” has been quietly preparing its next act—and this time, it’s got some heavy-hitting tools. With the Shibarium upgrade now live, gas fees are lower, speed is up, and SHIB’s ecosystem is growing. ShibaSwap has become a DeFi favorite, and token burns have started picking up again. SHIB’s recent surge in whale activity and retail chatter hints at something brewing under the surface. It’s even showing a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s latest breakout. So why is SHIB still on this list of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term? Because even after all these years, it still finds a way to sneak back into the big leagues—and this cycle could be no different. Final Thoughts – Before This Window Slams Shut… Here’s the truth most won’t tell you: Buying in the hype phase means you’re already late. That’s why presales like BTFD Coin give smart investors the chance to dodge volatility and market manipulation entirely. You’re locking in early—before whales come swimming. Whether you’re here for COQ’s energy, SHIB’s rebirth, or BTFD’s complete staking-to-gaming-to-ROI trifecta, one thing’s clear—this meme coin cycle is unlike any other. But let’s be honest—only one coin in this list is offering you double tokens, passive 90% APY rewards, and a projected 2900% return if it hits $0.006. That’s BTFD. And this opportunity doesn’t wait. So if you’re looking for the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term, you’ve just found the ones worth betting on. But don’t just watch from the sidelines.

ETH is now consolidating and remains at risk of a downside break. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $2,050 resistance level. The price is trading below $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,040 and $2,100 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and corrected some gains, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,040 and $2,020 support levels. It tested the $1,980 zone. A low was formed at $1,982 and the price recently attempted a fresh upward move. There was a move above the $2,020 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,098 swing high to the $1,982 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,040 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,050 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,098 swing high to the $1,982 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,095 level. A clear move above the $2,095 resistance might send the price toward the $2,150 resistance. An upside break above the $2,150 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,250 resistance zone or even $2,320 in the near term. Downside Break In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,040 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,000 level. The first major support sits near the $1,980 zone. A clear move below the $1,980 support might push the price toward the $1,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,820 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,750.

Despite Ethereum’s sluggish price action, multiple on-chain indicators and technical patterns hint at an impending bullish reversal. Ethereum Retail Sentiment At Low Amid Sluggish Price Action According to cryptocurrency analyst Mister Crypto, retail interest in ETH is “extremely low,” as indicated by Google Trends data. Compared to its 2017 and 2021 peaks, Ethereum’s current sentiment ranks significantly lower, suggesting that many retail investors are sitting on the sidelines. Historically, low retail sentiment often signals a prime buying opportunity for institutional investors looking to accumulate assets before the next price surge. While weak sentiment reflects a lack of confidence among small investors, institutions tend to take advantage of such conditions, positioning themselves ahead of the next bullish cycle. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Breaking Free from the Bear Trap? Analysts Weigh In Despite the pessimism, crypto analyst Ted pointed out that the potential approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) staking and the upcoming Pectra update could serve as key catalysts for a breakout. He suggests that these developments may help Ethereum regain momentum and push its price toward new highs. Fellow analyst Crypto Patel echoed this sentiment, noting that ETH is currently consolidating within an accumulation range. Based on historical price cycles and on-chain data, Patel expects Ethereum to break out after April, with a long-term target of $10,000. Additionally, analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted a bullish crossover on Ethereum’s weekly Stochastic RSI, a signal that has historically marked market bottoms. He suggests that ETH may be nearing the end of its bearish cycle, setting the stage for a strong rally. Further Pain For ETH? Sharing a contrasting viewpoint, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized that there has been “no change in the outlook for Ethereum.” The analyst hinted that ETH is still likely to hit the lower-end of its current price range at $1,300. However, some on-chain indicators suggest Ethereum may already be undervalued. An analysis using the Market Value to Realized Value Z-score (MVRV-Z) indicates that ETH is trading at levels historically associated with price rebounds. This metric, which compares Ethereum’s market value to its realized value, suggests that ETH might be primed for accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashing Bullish Signals, But Rising Exchange Reserves Raise Concerns – Details For Ethereum to confirm a bullish reversal, it must break through strong resistance at $2,300. A successful breakout could push ETH toward $3,000 in the short term. Failure to surpass this level, however, might result in extended consolidation or another price decline. At press time, ETH trades at $2,007, down 0.5% in the last 24 hours.

In response, the exchange fought back by suing the agency for overstepping its authority. However, in December, Crypto.com withdrew its lawsuit after President Donald Trump announced his intention to appoint pro-crypto figure Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair. Crypto.com’s Response Crypto.com’s legal troubles with the SEC began when regulators cracked down on multiple crypto firms. Unlike other exchanges that faced lawsuits or settlements, Crypto.com stood its ground, arguing that the SEC was unfairly targeting the industry. Nick Lundgren, the company’s Chief Legal Officer, called the investigation unnecessary and praised the decision to close it. He criticized the previous SEC leadership for its aggressive stance against crypto, saying it forced the industry into legal battles rather than providing clear regulations. With this case closed, Crypto.com remains one of the few global crypto exchanges that have avoided penalties or legal action from U.S. regulators. Crypto.com’s Compliance Record Stands Strong Throughout its legal fight, Crypto.com has maintained a strong compliance track record. The exchange has secured over 100 regulatory approvals worldwide and continues to operate within strict financial guidelines. This includes approvals from U.S. financial watchdogs, making it one of the most regulated platforms in the industry. With the SEC case behind it, Crypto.com is now focused on working with regulators to shape fairer policies for the crypto industry.

Ripple, which faced accusations from the SEC regarding its sale of XRP tokens, has now emerged victorious, as the judge ruled in favor of Ripple multiple times. The SEC’s decision to appeal earlier this year in January, even after the resignation of former chairman Gary Gensler, frustrated many, including Ripple. However, with the dismissal of the appeal, the legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple has now officially ended. Following the dismissal of the appeal, excitement surged in the crypto market, with XRP’s value experiencing a notable uptick. Despite this positive development for Ripple, enthusiasts are still awaiting a formal confirmation from the SEC. As of March 28, 2025, the SEC has officially announced the dismissal of litigation against several other companies, including Kraken, ConsenSys, and Cumberland, but has not yet made a statement on the Ripple case. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the SEC’s current focus is on addressing the procedural requirements for lifting the standard injunction imposed by Judge Torres, which has delayed the official end to the case. No @Ripple here but I’m not entirely surprised because, again, it is slightly different to these other cases in that (as @s_alderoty mentioned in his post) the SEC now has to go to the Southern District and ask Judge Torres to lift the standard injunction.

A vote by the SEC Commission is expected in less than 30 days. Once that happens, Ripple will not oppose the motion to lift the injunction, and Judge Torres will likely sign off on it. All of this means that within 60 days, Ripple’s legal battles with the SEC could be fully and formally resolved.

Popcat and Mog Coin have each made a splash with viral growth and big early gains, mostly fueled by humor and internet trends. Popcat leaned into the love for a classic meme, while Mog Coin tapped into the internet’s cat craze to build its momentum. But then there’s Dragoin ($DDGN) —a project with a twist. It offers more than just laughs or quick flips. Dragoin is shaping a full-on fantasy world where the presale is part of a bigger journey. It’s not just about buying a coin—it’s about being part of a growing legend. Popcat (POPCAT): Riding the Meme Wave to Big Returns Popcat (POPCAT) launched in late 2023 on Solana, and it wasted no time going viral. Based on the well-known “Pop Cat” meme, it skipped the usual presale, giving everyone an equal shot from day one. Solana’s fast, low-cost network helped the token take off quickly. The result? A massive 23,300% surge from launch to its peak in early 2024. As of March 24, 2025, POPCAT is trading at $0.2323, up 10.6% in the last 24 hours and 16.5% over the week. That’s still 88.7% down from its high, but early buyers remain well in the green. With nearly 980 million tokens in circulation and a $226 million market cap, Popcat is still going strong on Solana. It’s proof that humor, speed, and community can still go a long way in the meme coin space. Mog Coin (MOG): No Presale, Just Pure Community Power Mog Coin (MOG) made its debut in July 2023 on Ethereum. No presale, no venture funding—just memes and a loyal community. What started as a cat-themed token built real traction through word of mouth. That momentum eventually earned MOG a place on Coinbase’s roadmap and helped push the price to a high of $0.000004022 in December 2024. Fast forward to March 24, 2025: MOG is trading at $0.00000054, up 15.05% in 24 hours and 12.63% over the week. That’s still 86.6% below its top, but it’s up an incredible 11,807.2% since its 2023 low. With a $209 million market cap and more than 390 trillion tokens in circulation, MOG has proven that community energy and a good meme can still deliver big results—even without a big budget. Dragoin’s Presale Feels Like a Fantasy—and It Comes with Real Potential Dragoin ($DDGN) isn’t just here to join the meme coin race—it’s adding a new layer to it. The project is rolling out a 25-stage presale, and each one is named after major fantasy events, taking inspiration from series like Game of Thrones. But it’s not just clever names—each stage brings its own rewards and unique ways to engage. It all starts with Stage 1, “The Fall of Valyria.” Beyond the name, it’s Dragoin’s most affordable entry point. Like the fall of an empire in fiction, this moment marks the beginning of Dragoin’s rise. For early buyers, it’s a chance to grab tokens before the price moves up with each new round. More than anything, Dragoin is inviting people to be part of the journey. It’s not just about holding tokens—it’s about joining a community that grows stage by stage. As the presale continues, so do the rewards and engagement. The longer you stay in, the more involved you become. Why Dragoin Might Offer Something More Meaningful Popcat and Mog Coin have both shown how far a meme and an active crowd can go. They delivered big for early investors and sparked strong online support. They’ve also proven that even in a sea of tokens, a fun idea and good timing can still win. But Dragoin ($DDGN) is offering a different route. With a presale that doubles as a storyline, play-to-earn potential, and a focus on decentralization, it aims to do more than entertain. It wants to build something lasting. Every phase of the presale is a step in an unfolding tale—and that makes the investment feel like more than just a trade. For those thinking beyond short-term gains, Dragoin could be where the real story begins.

Every week brings fresh momentum for select coins, sparking interest among smart market watchers. These aren’t just rising in value—they’re also showing signs of strong future growth. For anyone tracking the next big move, now is the time to dig deeper into a few standout names. Among the best-performing cryptos are BlockDAG, Polkadot, Near Protocol, and XRP. These names are gaining traction for both daily trading and long-term potential. With active communities and steady development, they’re attracting attention in today’s market. Here’s a closer look at why they could be key players in 2025. BlockDAG (BDAG): Fast Transactions Speed and Huge ROI Potential BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly earning a spot among the best-performing cryptos in 2025. Known for its high speed and ability to scale, BlockDAG can support large DeFi platforms and handle heavy transaction loads without issues. It also places strong focus on safety, using advanced cryptography to protect data and block harmful actions. With this secure and growing system, more people are turning to BlockDAG over other options. The project’s presale has now passed $207 million, with plans to reach $600 million soon. BDAG’s price has jumped from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0248 in batch 27—a 2,380% rise. With its mainnet launch and 10 exchange listings coming up, interest in BDAG coins is likely to increase even more. Experts predict BDAG could hit $1 in 2025 and possibly reach $30 by 2030, thanks to its steady presale progress and strong outlook. For those aiming at long-term gains, buying at the current low price might offer one of the best chances to benefit from future growth. Polkadot (DOT): Linking Different Chains in One Place Polkadot focuses on connecting different blockchain systems under one structure. Instead of being separate, chains on Polkadot can share information and tools. This boosts performance across the full network. A key part of its design is the parachain auctions, where new chains compete for limited spots, which raises the project’s quality overall. With more parachains set to go live in 2025, excitement is growing for Polkadot. These updates could support both higher use and price gains. Those looking for value in a busy market may find Polkadot’s approach and expanding reach worth paying attention to. It holds steady among the best-performing cryptos. Near Protocol (NEAR): Quick, Cheap, and Developer-Focused Near Protocol stays relevant due to its fast speed, low costs, and expanding use cases. It handles more users without slowing down, thanks to its special structure called sharding. This makes Near more efficient than others that get clogged up as users increase. Backed by a $100 million fund and more activity from developers, Near could see major gains soon. As more users demand quicker and affordable platforms, Near is well placed to grow. It stands as one of the best-performing cryptos for upcoming growth. Ripple (XRP): Still Active Despite Legal Uncertainty Ripple (XRP) remains among the best-performing cryptos due to its global payments role and ongoing case with the SEC. Even with legal delays, XRP draws attention from both traders and institutions. Ripple’s system is still used by banks and firms for fast money transfers, keeping it relevant. If Ripple gets a good result in court, it could lift XRP’s price and use in a big way. Through all the ups and downs, its place in the money-transfer space gives XRP long-term promise. Best Performing Cryptos in 2025— Final Words! Each of these best-performing cryptos brings something different to the table. Polkadot gives solid cross-chain features, Near Protocol delivers speed and low fees, and XRP is strong in payment use—each has potential for the future. But only one shows signs of much larger returns. BlockDAG has already crossed $207 million in presale funds with over 18.9 billion coins sold. The current price of $0.0248 in batch 27 has experts saying $1 in 2025 is realistic, and even $30 by 2030. These signs make BDAG stand out clearly from the rest of the best-performing cryptos .

According to a Mar. 27 announcement on Circle’s official blog, the demand for stablecoins has been rising despite market volatility. Stablecoins have found a strong product-market fit in both the web3 and traditional finance sectors. However, many companies struggle to set up stablecoin transactions due to technical and compliance hurdles. USDCKit will help remove these barriers by providing large-scale payment processing, automated fund transfers, and integrated regulatory tools. Any business that handles large amounts of USD Coin ( USDC ) transactions could benefit, even though payment service providers and remittance platforms will probably be the first users. USDCKit will also facilitate the smooth transfer of USDC between networks by supporting several blockchains, such as Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ).

GameStop (GME) short sales volume — the total number of shares sold short within a specific timeframe — rose 234% over 24 hours, reaching 30.85 million shares sold on March 27, according to TradingView data. The SSR kicks in when a stock drops over 10% from the previous day’s closing price. GameStop’s stock fell 22% over the trading day, wiping out its 12% gain from the Bitcoin announcement and then some, according to Google Finance data. At the time of publication, GME was trading at $22.09. GameStop shorts volume near 2021 short squeeze levels The rule is applied for the rest of the trading day and the following trading day. Malone Wealth president and CEO Kevin Malone said in a March 27 X post that “GameStop traded 50x more shares today than last Thursday. Not statistically possible without naked short-selling.” GameStop’s short sale volume reached 30.88 million on March 27. Source: TradingView The number is close to the levels reached in January 2021 when GameStop stocks famously went meteoric after a “short squeeze” of the stock, causing significant losses for hedge funds and other short sellers while some retail traders made significant returns. The highest point reached during that month was 33.26 million shares on Jan. 19. GameStop Bitcoin buy is “dot-comish” GameStop did not specify how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase, but after the markets closed on March 26, the firm announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering . However, some analysts and commentators have questioned GameStop’s plan to start purchasing Bitcoin. Speaking to Yahoo Finance on March 27, Tastylive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff said that GameStop's decision to buy Bitcoin feels “a little dot-comish” to him. Source: Hans Akamatsu “It feels a little like, oh, I’m going to throw a dot com at the end of my name, I’m going to buy some Bitcoin with our excess cash because we can’t find a company that is going to be accretive,” Sosnoff said. Meanwhile, Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro , told Reuters on March 27 that “investors are not necessarily optimistic on the underlying business.” Biggest day of short sales still goes to Keith Gill’s return The biggest day of short sales still belongs to June 3, 2024, when it reached 46.20 million. This was around the time Keith Gill, a stock trader known for the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, revealed on June 2 that he had started trading GameStop stock again, this time with $180 million to play with. Related: Firms without business models ‘buy Bitcoin’ — Angel investor Jason Calacanis GameStop said the convertible senior notes — debt that can later be converted into equity — will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquiring Bitcoin. Some analysts see the convertible notes offering announcement as the reason for the stock’s decline. Han Akamatsu said in a March 27 X post that GameStop’s stock is dropping for the same reason Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) declined after issuing convertible notes. “In 2021, MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes, the stock dipped after the announcement due to hedging shorts, but later exploded when Bitcoin ripped and the arbitrage unspooled,” Akamatsu said, adding: “GME is following the same blueprint now ...If GME or BTC goes up a lot, the trade gets very interesting as we have a squeeze opportunity here.” Magazine: Arbitrum co-founder skeptical of move to based and native rollups: Steven Goldfeder This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.35 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.3850 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.478 swing high to the $2.301 low. The next resistance is $2.420. A clear move above the $2.420 resistance might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance or even $2.550 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.620. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.30 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level.

42513487,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144091,1743137750,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Agent Automates Qonto Invoice Retrieval: A Game-Changer for Businesses,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-agent-qonto-invoice-automation/,"Are you tired of spending countless hours wrestling with invoices? Imagine a world where this tedious task is handled automatically, freeing up your valuable time to focus on what truly matters – growing your business. Paris-based startup Twin is turning this vision into reality with its groundbreaking AI agent , and their first mission is to revolutionize invoice management for Qonto’s 500,000+ European customers. What Makes Twin’s AI Agent a Game-Changer for Invoice Automation? In a landscape buzzing with automation solutions, Twin is carving a unique path. While traditional methods like API integrations, no-code platforms, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have their place, Twin believes there’s a smarter, more efficient way forward. Their secret weapon? Artificial Intelligence, specifically, sophisticated AI agents designed to learn and adapt like humans, but with the speed and precision of machines. Let’s break down why Twin’s approach to invoice automation is generating buzz: Beyond Traditional RPA: RPA often relies on rigid scripts that break when website layouts change. Twin’s AI agent , powered by OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, navigates websites dynamically, adapting to changes on the fly. Scalability and Breadth: Forget custom scripts for every website. Twin’s Invoice Operator is designed to handle the “long tail” of online services – thousands upon thousands – making it incredibly scalable for businesses dealing with diverse vendors. User-Friendly Simplicity: No coding skills or complex configurations are needed. Twin prioritizes ease of use. Even non-tech-savvy users can launch Invoice Operator, log into their accounts, and let the AI agent take over. Invoice Operator: How Does This AI Agent Actually Work with Qonto? Twin’s debut product, Invoice Operator, is specifically tailored for Qonto users. Qonto, a leading fintech providing business bank accounts, understands the invoice pain point intimately. Millions of invoices flow through their platform monthly, and businesses often spend precious hours manually collecting and uploading these documents. Invoice Operator steps in to streamline this process. Here’s a glimpse into its workflow: Transaction Analysis: The agent starts by identifying Qonto transactions that are missing invoices. Intelligent Service Access: Invoice Operator presents a list of services it needs to access to retrieve invoices, alongside a window showcasing the agent’s actions in real-time. Secure Credential Input: For services requiring login, the agent pauses and prompts the user to manually enter credentials, ensuring security and user control. Automated Retrieval and Attachment: Once authorized, the AI agent intelligently navigates to find past transactions, download invoices as PDFs, and automatically attach them to the corresponding transactions within the user’s Qonto account. Imagine the hours saved, the reduced errors, and the newfound efficiency – all thanks to this intelligent invoice automation tool. Why is Twin Betting on Computer-Using Agents? Hugo Mercier, Twin’s co-founder and CEO, highlights the limitations of existing automation approaches. He points out that RPA requires custom scripts for each website, becoming a maintenance nightmare as websites evolve. API-based solutions like Zapier, while powerful, take years to integrate with thousands of applications. Twin’s embrace of Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) offers a compelling alternative. Here’s why CUAs are poised to be the future of automation: Feature RPA API Automation (e.g., Zapier) Computer-Using Agents (Twin) Website Change Adaptation Requires script modification Not applicable (API-based) Adapts dynamically Scalability across Services Limited, script per website Extensive, but slow integration Highly scalable, broad service coverage Ease of Use for End-Users Can be complex, often requires technical expertise User-friendly, but limited to API integrations Designed for simplicity, no coding needed Development Speed Slow, script development per website Moderate, API integration dependent Rapid, leverages AI learning Twin’s early success with Invoice Operator, supporting thousands of applications within months, underscores the potential of CUAs. Being among the first to leverage OpenAI’s CUA model in beta gives them a significant head start in this exciting field. Beyond Invoices: What’s Next for AI-Powered Business Automation? While Invoice Operator is focused on Qonto and invoice retrieval, Twin envisions a much broader future for B2B AI agents. They believe that agentic applications can transform various industries and business processes. Imagine business automation extending to: E-commerce Order Management: Agents automatically handling orders, tracking shipments, and managing inventory. Marketplace Catalog Classification: Agents intelligently categorizing and tagging products, ensuring accurate and efficient catalog management. Call Center Support: Agents retrieving information and providing real-time assistance to call center representatives, improving customer service and efficiency. Twin’s vision is clear: AI agents are poised to become faster, cheaper, and more accurate, revolutionizing how businesses operate. The question now is whether Twin can transform their core agent platform into a developer-friendly product, empowering others to build their own agent-powered applications.

A recent analysis from CryptoQuant provides a closer look at how top crypto have performed in terms of market cap and drawdowns over the past several months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend, But Analyst Warns Of Strong Resistance Ahead BNB, XRP, and Ethereum Show Diverging Trends One of the most notable shifts has been Binance Coin (BNB) reclaiming its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. BNB’s market cap rose to approximately $92 billion, surpassing Solana (SOL), which now sits at $74 billion. This shift follows a strong rally in SOL during late 2024, largely fueled by growth in its meme coin ecosystem. However, the attention of speculative activity appears to have transitioned toward the BNB Chain, where similar crypto ecosystem momentum has helped support its recovery. Another significant market cap development involves XRP. According to CryptoQuant, XRP’s market capitalization increased substantially following the 2024 US presidential election. Market Cap Evolution of Top Cryptocurrencies BNB and Bitcoin are currently experiencing the lowest drawdowns among this group, each down approximately 20% from their all-time highs, indicating relatively strong price performance and resilience. pic.twitter.com/dW3tXlvSMG — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 From a valuation of $30 billion in early November, XRP’s market cap climbed to $141 billion by March 2025. The timing of this rise appears to align with the outcome of the US election, which some believe could potentially influence regulatory sentiment around crypto assets. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) has faced a more challenging trajectory. After peaking in late 2024, ETH’s market capitalization declined by 50% to around $240 billion as of March 2025. This sharp drop highlights the current volatility in the altcoin market and raises questions about Ethereum’s ability to maintain its prior valuation levels amid shifting macro and sector-specific factors. Crypto Price Resilience and Drawdown Metrics CryptoQuant’s report also evaluated drawdowns—the decline from an asset’s all-time high—as a measure of relative performance. Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB emerged as the most resilient assets among the group, each down approximately 20% from their respective all-time highs. BNB’s stability has been linked to its continued utility within the Binance ecosystem, including usage for transaction fees and platform-related activities. Meanwhile, ETH and SOL have struggled to recover from deeper drawdowns. Both assets are currently more than 50% below their previous peaks, highlighting higher levels of volatility and reduced investor momentum.

Ex-SEC Lawyer Clarifies appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After four long years of legal battles, the fight between Ripple and the SEC has finally come to a halt. The legal showdown that has drawn attention from both the crypto community and financial regulators appears to be over, but some lingering questions remain. Despite a statement from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, XRP supporters are still waiting for official confirmation from the SEC itself. Amid ongoing speculation, a document recently circulated online claiming that the SEC will not make an official announcement about the lawsuit until August 7. However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel quickly dismissed the document, stating, “This is stupid and wrong. You’re welcome!” Others pointed out that the document in question was from last summer, further fueling doubts about its validity. Lawyer dropping by to say: this is stupid and wrong. You’re welcome! — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 28, 2025 Just last week, the SEC decided to drop its appeal without any conditions. In return, Ripple has agreed to drop its cross-appeal. As part of the settlement, the SEC will keep $50 million of the $125 million fine, which is already held in an interest-bearing escrow account. The remaining balance will be returned to Ripple. Additionally, the SEC should ask the court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request. However, this process isn’t immediate. Before the injunction can be lifted, the SEC must first vote on the decision, and then Judge Torres must be asked to lift it. This will likely happen in the coming weeks, All of this is still subject to a Commission vote, the drafting of final documents, and the usual court processes.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 05:05:48

DOGE is declining and might test the $0.180 support zone. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.1980 and $0.1920 levels. The price is trading above the $0.180 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.1950 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1940 and $0.1980 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $0.2050, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.1980 and $0.1920 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1665 swing low to the $0.2057 high. There was also a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.1950 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.180 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1920 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1980 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2050 level. A close above the $0.2050 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2150 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2220 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2350. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1920 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1860 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1665 swing low to the $0.2057 high. The next major support is near the $0.1820 level. The main support sits at $0.1750. If there is a downside break below the $0.1750 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.170 level or even $0.1650 in the near term.

The lawsuit was officially dismissed in a joint stipulation between the crypto exchange and the South Carolina Attorney General’s securities division on March 27. “South Carolina just joined Vermont to dismiss its unfounded staking lawsuit against Coinbase,” the firm’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said in a March 27 X post. “This is not just a victory for us, but for American consumers and we hope it's a sign of things to come in the few states left that restrict staking.” South Carolina Attorney General and Coinbase’s joint stipulation. Source: South Carolina Attorney General South Carolina and Vermont were two of 10 US states that took legal action against Coinbase's staking services on June 6, 2023 — the same day that the federal securities regulator filed its lawsuit against the crypto exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission officially dismissed that lawsuit on Feb. 27, 2025. The other eight US states that filed enforcement action similar to South Carolina were Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin. Grewal said he hoped to see other states follow suit, and that South Carolina residents lost an estimated $2 million in staking rewards as a result of the lawsuit. “The 52 million Americans who own crypto deserve commonsense consumer protections and clear rules,” he said. “We applaud South Carolina for standing up for justice and hope the remaining states with bans on staking will take notice.” South Carolina introduces Bitcoin reserve bill Meanwhile, a state lawmaker has just introduced the “Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act of South Carolina” on March 27, which could see the state treasurer allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ). Unlike most US state crypto reserve bills, North Carolina’s House Bill 4256, introduced by Rep. Jordan Pace, mentioned Bitcoin on several occasions for the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve that the bill seeks to establish. Source: Jordan Pace The bill allows South Carolina’s treasurer, currently Curtis Loftis, to establish a Bitcoin reserve that exceeds no more than 1 million Bitcoin — a high ceiling that the US federal government is also looking to reach or exceed with its recently established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The treasurer would be able to add Bitcoin to South Carolina’s General Fund, the Budget Stabilization Reserve Fund any other investment fund that they manage. Related: Coinbase files FOIA to see how much the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ cost While no mention of stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, Ether ( ETH ) or any other crypto tokens was made, the House bill said the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve wouldn’t be limited to Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin Law, 42 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced at the state level in 19 states, and 36 of those 42 bills remain live. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

While this technology already helps safeguard Coinbase assets, we’re raising the bar for security across the industry by making it… — Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) March 27, 2025 With the code now available on GitHub, developers and organizations can easily integrate MPC into their security systems. Coinbase hopes to promote the industry’s wider adoption of state-of-the-art security features by open-sourcing these tools. The company has also launched a bug bounty program for security researchers to help identify errors in the code.

It currently supports over 430 assets for custody and 250 for trading. Improving security continues to be its top priority as more institutions adopt Coinbase Prime for safe transactions and custody. Coinbase Institutional’s latest move coincides with the rapid surge in cyberattacks against the crypto industry. In the first quarter alone, hackers stole $1.64 billion, making it the worst quarter for security breaches in history, according to Immunefi’s Q1 2025 report . 94% of all losses were on centralized platforms. The Bybit hack alone accounted for $1.53 billion, making it the biggest exploit in crypto history. Ethereum ( ETH ) and BNB Chain ( BNB ) were the main targets for on-chain exploits, with 15 and 19 attacks, respectively. Only $6.5 million, or 0.4% of the total funds stolen in Q1, has been recovered so far. Coinbase’s move to make its MPC library open-source may be a step toward improved security measures for the sector as hackers become more sophisticated.

In a blog post on Mar. 27, the exchange revealed the news, pointing out that it had previously received a Wells notice from the SEC before suing the agency in October 2024. The lawsuit, which claimed the SEC had overstepped its authority, was later dismissed in December. The investigation has now ended with no penalties. Nick Lundgren, Crypto.com’s Chief Legal Officer, welcomed the decision, stating: “We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com with no enforcement action or settlement,” He criticized the previous SEC leadership, claiming the agency had misused its power to target the crypto industry.

The blockchain payments firm recently announced a partnership with African fintech platform Chipper Cash to facilitate crypto-enabled cross-border payments across the continent. At the same time, cryptocurrency index fund manager Bitwise has published a new long-term forecast suggesting XRP’s price could reach as high as $29 by 2030 if the token gains significant traction in the payments and asset tokenization sectors. Ripple Partners With Chipper Cash to Power Crypto-Enabled Cross-Border Payments in Africa Blockchain payments firm Ripple has announced a strategic partnership with African payment infrastructure provider Chipper Cash, marking another significant move in its mission to revolutionize global remittance corridors. According to a March 27 press release, Chipper Cash will leverage Ripple’s crypto-enabled payment solution, Ripple Payments, to facilitate cross-border transactions across key African markets. The companies said the alliance is designed to address some of the most pressing challenges in the African payments landscape — particularly the high cost, slow speed, and lack of transparency often associated with cross-border money transfers. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized the importance of the partnership in Ripple's broader strategy to deepen its presence on the continent. This partnership is an important step in Ripple’s expansion in Africa, Merrick said. Chipper Cash, one of Africa’s leading financial technology companies, operates in over 20 countries and is widely regarded as a major player in driving financial inclusion on the continent. Co-founder and CEO Ham Serunjogi underscored the impact crypto-enabled solutions can have in reducing the cost and complexity of cross-border transactions. “Crypto-enabled payments have the potential to enable greater financial inclusion, accelerate access to global markets, and empower businesses and individuals across Africa,” Serunjogi stated. He added that integrating Ripple’s technology into Chipper Cash's platform will allow their customers “to receive payments faster and at lower cost.” The partnership with Chipper Cash builds upon Ripple’s previous initiatives in the region. In late 2023, Ripple inked a deal with African fintech Onafriq, enabling payments between 27 African countries and international markets such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Chipper Cash collaboration is another example of Ripple’s focus on emerging economies where blockchain adoption is accelerating, particularly in the payments and remittance sectors. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis highlighted that stablecoins now account for nearly half of all transaction volume in Sub-Saharan Africa — a clear sign of the region’s growing interest in digital asset solutions. Further supporting this trend, a late 2024 industry report projected that several African economies could evolve into key digital asset hubs, fueled by increasing crypto adoption, a young digital-savvy population, and an urgent need for accessible financial infrastructure. Africa remains one of the most expensive regions in the world for sending money. According to World Bank data, the average cost of sending remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa is around 8%, compared to the global average of 6.2%. Blockchain-based payment networks like Ripple aim to address these inefficiencies, making cross-border transactions faster, more transparent, and considerably cheaper. Merrick noted that the growing adoption of blockchain technology in remittances is a natural response to the market’s inefficiencies. “By integrating our technology into Chipper Cash’s platform, we’re enabling faster, more affordable cross-border payments while driving economic growth and innovation across the markets they serve,” he said. Ripple’s Global Expansion Continues The partnership comes amid a series of strategic wins for Ripple globally. Earlier in March, the company secured a payments license in Dubai, allowing it to offer cryptocurrency-powered payment solutions in the United Arab Emirates — a critical gateway between Europe, Asia, and Africa. Ripple's momentum follows a major legal victory in its prolonged battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The court’s favorable decision has provided regulatory clarity, enabling Ripple to confidently expand its services without the shadow of legal uncertainty. The Ripple-Chipper Cash partnership is being welcomed by industry observers as another significant step in unlocking the potential of blockchain technology in developing economies. Financial inclusion advocates and crypto analysts alike have long argued that blockchain could reshape financial infrastructure across Africa, where traditional banking access remains limited and cross-border payments are costly and inefficient. While Ripple and Chipper Cash have yet to provide further details on rollout timelines or target corridors, the move underscores a broader trend: Africa’s payment infrastructure is rapidly evolving, and crypto is playing an increasingly central role. Bitwise Predicts XRP Could Soar to $29 by 2030 in Max Bullish Scenario Meanwhile, in a report that is turning heads across the crypto industry, cryptocurrency index fund manager Bitwise Asset Management has unveiled a range of long-term price scenarios for the XRP token, projecting that the asset could potentially soar to $29.32 by 2030 in what it calls its ”max scenario.” Bitwise’s ambitious forecast, released earlier this week, is based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and factors in XRP’s potential market share in two critical sectors: cross-border payments and real-world asset tokenization. The firm argues that even a modest penetration into these trillion-dollar markets could propel XRP’s market capitalization to levels previously unimaginable — surpassing even the likes of Microsoft’s current market cap. In its most optimistic projection, Bitwise estimates that XRP’s market capitalization could grow to $2.9 trillion by the end of the decade. At that valuation, each XRP token would be worth $29.32, positioning the digital asset alongside the world's largest corporations in terms of financial weight. Bitwise’s report outlines the conditions necessary for this “max scenario” to play out, highlighting the need for XRP to capture a ”meaningful” share of the rapidly expanding payments market and the booming asset tokenization sector. In particular, tokenization — the process of converting real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain — is seen as a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. While the $29 projection is eye-catching, Bitwise has also presented two alternative scenarios: Bull Scenario: In a moderately optimistic case, XRP could climb to $12.70 by 2030 if the network maintains steady growth and faces minimal regulatory or technological obstacles. However, in this scenario, XRP would fail to capture substantial market share in payments or tokenization, relying instead on incremental adoption and usage. Bear Scenario: On the other end of the spectrum, Bitwise warns that XRP could plummet to $0.13 if it fails to secure institutional adoption and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem struggles to attract users. Such an outcome would represent a near-total collapse of XRP's value. Looking ahead, one of the key catalysts that could potentially ignite XRP’s momentum is the approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States — a development that appears increasingly likely. Bitwise itself filed for an XRP ETF in October 2024, and analysts expect other financial heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity to follow suit. According to crypto market analyst Nate Geraci, XRP’s inclusion in the ETF landscape is “almost inevitable” now that the regulatory clouds have cleared. An XRP ETF would make the token more accessible to institutional and retail investors alike, potentially driving substantial inflows into the asset. Tokenization, Payments, and the XRP Ecosystem Bitwise’s price projections are based on the belief that XRP is uniquely positioned to benefit from two powerful trends: the rise of blockchain-powered cross-border payments and the tokenization of real-world assets. Ripple has already made significant strides in the payments sector, recently expanding its payment network in Africa through a partnership with fintech firm Chipper Cash. Additionally, Ripple’s growing presence in tokenization initiatives is aligned with its broader mission to create seamless, blockchain-based financial infrastructure. However, Bitwise cautions that the road ahead is uncertain. The adoption of XRP in these sectors depends on regulatory clarity, technological advancements, and Ripple’s ability to onboard institutional clients at scale.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 05:30:00

While SHIB and PEPE continue to ride waves of social hype, large holders appear to be prioritizing utility and long-term upside. Remittix, currently in presale, has delivered over 300% returns for early investors and is quickly gaining momentum as the top crypto whales look for the best crypto to invest in . On-Chain Data Shows Massive Drop in SHIB Whale Inflows Shiba Inu has recently recorded a decent uptrend, posting an 11.4% gain in under a week and sparking excitement among investors. From a low of $0.00001280 on March 21 to a peak of $0.00001550 by March 26, SHIB looked like it was clawing its way back into the spotlight. Even now, it’s holding ground above $0.00001400 , a level that many see as key to sustaining momentum. But beneath the surface, the picture isn’t so pretty. Whale activity—the lifeblood of sustained rallies in meme coins—is drying up fast. Over the past month, large SHIB transactions have plummeted by 70% . Even more alarming, whale outflows have dropped 73%, and inflows are down 85%. This kind of drop-off tells a clear story: the big money is stepping away. The crucial support at $0.000012 is now in focus. If SHIB loses that footing, analysts warn that a slide to $0.000010 is likely. Trader sentiment is mixed. While some, like ‘ World Of Charts ,’ point to a potential breakout from a descending channel, others argue the recent gains are more of a temporary bounce than a trend shift. Either way, the fact remains—those with the most skin in the game seem to be taking profits and reallocating. And where is that capital flowing? Not back into SHIB . It’s being redirected to newer projects with stronger narratives, practical use cases, and cleaner tokenomics. Investors Question Whether Pepe Can Sustain Momentum Pepe Coin has made headlines once again, but not all for bullish reasons. On March 27, 2025, a newly created wallet pulled 500 billion PEPE —roughly $4.3 million—from Binance, sparking debate across the trading community. While some initially saw this as whale accumulation, deeper analysis suggests a different trend may be forming. With PEPE trading at $0.000008521 and volume surging past $668 million, the optics look strong on the surface. But the timing of this withdrawal is raising eyebrows. Despite breaking above the 50-day EMA and climbing 10.4% in the past week, on-chain signals show that whales may be using these mini-pumps to exit rather than accumulate. Large-scale movements like the Binance withdrawal are increasingly viewed as redistributions rather than long-term commitments. Traders watching PEPE closely have noted that similar price spikes have led to dumps in the past, and the current lack of sustained accumulation reinforces that narrative. The current price uptick to $0.0000085 is notable, but without consistent whale support, this momentum could fade fast. In fact, some analysts believe the recent rally is more of a trap for retail investors than a signal of continued bullish growth. PEPE’s meme coin appeal keeps it volatile and popular, but recent trends suggest big players may be offloading on strength while shifting focus to fundamentally stronger alternatives. As SHIB and PEPE whales quietly rotate capital into projects with real utility, one rising token is catching their attention—and this time, it’s not just hype driving the interest. Crypto Whales Bet on Remittix as Best Crypto to Invest In While many crypto whales have used recent price spikes in Shiba Inu and Pepe to exit their positions, a surprising amount of capital is flowing into a lesser-known project— Remittix (RTX) . This Ethereum-based altcoin has quickly gained traction during its presale, delivering over 300% gains for early participants. Unlike meme coins driven by hype, Remittix is rooted in solving a real problem: cross-border payments. Its PayFi infrastructure enables fast, low-fee international transactions that convert crypto to fiat in minutes. At the heart of the Remittix surge is its DeFi-native RTX token, which powers a payment system designed for both individuals and businesses seeking alternatives to traditional banking bottlenecks. Its appeal has been magnified by a fully audited smart contract, with BlockSAFU confirming its security protocols. For investors burned by rug pulls or speculative plays, this is a reassuring differentiator. With tokens still priced at $0.0734, investors view this as a ground-floor opportunity. Analysts forecast as much as 30x returns once the token lists on major exchanges. As the memecoin craze shows signs of slowing, whales appear to be making a calculated shift—exchanging hype for long-term potential. Right now, Remittix is where that narrative is unfolding.

The bank will focus on small, newly created tokens developed by French teams and may also support their listings on exchanges. State-owned French investment bank Bpifrance has unveiled a €25m fund to directly invest in emerging French crypto assets. The decision falls under the bank’s ongoing efforts to nurture the experimentation of blockchain technologies and the growth of the digital asset market in France. Arnaud Caudoux, the deputy CEO of Bpifrance, explained that the goal was clearly to accelerate the crypto industry. The public investment bank, which has invested over €150M in the crypto sector over the past 10 years, plans to accelerate its investment and spend roughly the same amount over the next four years. 💥BREAKING: 🇫🇷 FRENCH STATE-OWNED BANK BPIFRANCE LAUNCHES €25M FUND FOR NEW FRENCH CRYPTO TOKENS BANKING FOMO IS HERE 🚀 pic.twitter.com/1j5T9nCJyt — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) March 27, 2025 Bpifrance has taken stock after 10 years of investing in the crypto industry, and it’s quite positive. Caudoux confirmed this Thursday that the results were there despite some of the ups and downs specific to this industry. The institution has supported approximately 200 blockchain startups since 2014, injecting more than €150 million through partner funds, as well as direct equity investments of €15 million. Caudoux noted that, with the exception of a few cases, all Bpifrance crypto projects were still active, and most were experiencing strong growth. He insisted that it was time to accelerate France’s crypto venture in the context of a dynamic U.S. In this context, Bpifrance has, therefore, decided to double its investment by 2029, diversifying its financing tools: loans, equity investments, and now token investments. “Instead of purchasing large cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the fund will be targeted towards buying smaller newly-created tokens issued by French projects, before they are listed on crypto exchanges.” – Arnaud Caudoux Clara Chappaz, France’s Minister Delegate in charge of AI and Digital, said Bpifrance’s initiative strongly signals its determination to make France a country of excellence for these technologies. France joins the U.S. in reviving crypto interest among investors According to Reuters, interest in crypto has revived globally since President Trump’s election win in November. Trump has expressed support for the industry, sought to overhaul policies, and even launched his own crypto products. However, European finance ministers are concerned that the U.S. embrace of crypto could affect eurozone monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Caudoux said that U.S. policies were attracting crypto companies to move there. He added that Europe had great engineers and great companies, and ‘we want to keep those companies here because we strongly believe that it is very important in the future to have our own ecosystem.’ Caudoux also asserted that Bpifrance will continue with its lending activity, but it will focus on equity investments and tokens, following the successful experiences with Morpho and Aleph. Bpifrance has since exited Aleph but still holds its Morpho tokens. Bpifrance’s plan provides for a balanced allocation with €100 million in direct investments, €100 million in indirect investments via partner funds (Cathay Ledger in particular), and a €25 million envelope dedicated to tokens. Caudoux explained that Bpifrance could not yet create a token fund due to regulatory reasons, so the bank was planning to make investments as they arose, and they would be included on Bpifrance’s balance sheet. A few days ago, Chappaz announced her intention to take measures to continue supporting the French sector from a regulatory and financial perspective. She said she will bring together crypto stakeholders in April to assess the state of the sector and ensure that France was ‘always a place of choice’.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s sending ripples through the digital asset space. Get ready for a fresh wave of trading opportunities as Binance unveils the listing of not one, but four brand-new crypto tokens! Let’s dive into the details of this surprising development and explore what it means for the market. What’s the Buzz About These New Crypto Tokens on Binance? In a move that highlights the power of community engagement, Binance has announced the listing of Mubarak (MUBARAK), CZ’SDog (BROCCOLI714), Tutorial (TUT), and BananaForScale (BANANAS31). These tokens are the chosen ones, emerging victorious from Binance’s innovative “vote to list” process. This initiative allows the Binance community to directly influence which projects get listed on the platform, adding a layer of decentralization to the listing process itself. The official announcement, posted on Binance’s website, confirms that trading for these tokens will commence promptly at 9 p.m. (UTC) today. This rapid listing following the vote underscores Binance’s commitment to swiftly responding to community preferences and expanding its diverse ecosystem of tradable assets. Decoding the “Vote to List” Process: How Did These Tokens Make the Cut? Binance’s “vote to list” mechanism is designed to empower its users. Here’s a breakdown of how it typically works: Community Nomination: Projects interested in being listed on Binance can be nominated and put forward for consideration. Voting Rounds: Binance users who hold a certain amount of BNB (Binance Coin) are given voting power. They can cast their votes for their preferred projects. Outcome and Listing: The projects that garner the most votes in a specific round are then reviewed by Binance for technical and compliance checks. If they pass these checks, they are scheduled for listing. This process ensures that listed tokens have demonstrated community support and interest, potentially leading to more vibrant trading activity right from the start. The inclusion of Mubarak, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale showcases the diverse range of projects that can capture the attention of the crypto community. Meet the New Contenders: A Closer Look at MUBARAK, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale While detailed information about each of these newly listed tokens might be still emerging, let’s take a brief initial look based on their names and potential themes: Mubarak (MUBARAK): The name “Mubarak” translates to “blessed” or “fortunate” in Arabic. It’s possible this token is community-driven or meme-inspired, potentially with a focus on positivity or cultural themes. Further details on its utility and purpose will be crucial to understand its long-term potential. CZ’SDog (BROCCOLI714): This token’s name is clearly a playful nod to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of Binance, combined with “Dog,” suggesting a meme coin in the vein of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. The “BROCCOLI714” part could be an inside joke or reference within its community. Meme coins often thrive on community enthusiasm and social media trends. Tutorial (TUT): “Tutorial” suggests an educational or guide-focused project. This token might be associated with a platform that offers learning resources, tutorials, or educational content related to blockchain, cryptocurrencies, or other topics. Its value proposition could lie in its utility for accessing or incentivizing educational content. BananaForScale (BANANAS31): This name is quirky and meme-like, referencing the internet meme of using a banana for scale in images. It’s highly likely to be another meme coin, potentially with a humorous or lighthearted community focus. Its appeal will likely depend on its community and viral potential. Important Note: As with all newly listed cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins and community tokens, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and exercise caution when trading. These tokens can be highly volatile, and understanding their fundamentals, community, and use cases is essential before investing. What Trading Pairs Can We Expect for These New Crypto Listings? The Binance announcement mentions that trading will open for “certain trading pairs.” While the specific pairs weren’t detailed in the initial announcement, we can anticipate that they will likely include pairings with major cryptocurrencies like: USDT (Tether): A stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDT pairs are common for most crypto listings, providing a stable base currency for trading. BTC (Bitcoin): Bitcoin pairs are also frequently offered, allowing traders to exchange the new tokens directly for Bitcoin. BUSD (Binance USD): As Binance’s own stablecoin, BUSD pairs are also highly probable. BNB (Binance Coin): BNB pairs are common within the Binance ecosystem, offering utility for the native Binance token. Keep an eye on the Binance trading platform shortly before 9 p.m. (UTC) today to see the exact trading pairs that will be available for MUBARAK, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale. This information will be critical for traders looking to participate in the initial trading activity. Why are Binance Listings a Big Deal for New Crypto Tokens? Getting listed on Binance is a significant milestone for any cryptocurrency project. Here’s why it matters: Increased Visibility and Exposure: Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. A listing instantly exposes a token to millions of users globally. Enhanced Liquidity: Binance provides deep liquidity, making it easier for traders to buy and sell tokens without significant price slippage. This is crucial for healthy price discovery and market stability. Credibility Boost: Binance has a rigorous listing process (even with community votes). Being listed on Binance can enhance a project’s credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of investors. Potential Price Impact: Historically, Binance listings have often led to a “Binance Effect,” where the price of the listed token experiences a significant surge due to increased demand and accessibility. However, this is not guaranteed and depends on various market factors. Navigating the New Listings: Tips for Crypto Traders As these new crypto listings go live on Binance, here are some actionable insights for traders: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before trading any new cryptocurrency, especially meme coins or community tokens, conduct thorough research. Understand their purpose, community, tokenomics, and risks. Start Small: Given the potential volatility of newly listed tokens, especially in the initial trading hours, consider starting with small positions. Manage your risk effectively. Monitor Trading Pairs: Pay close attention to the available trading pairs and liquidity. Be aware of potential price fluctuations and spreads, especially in the early stages of trading. Stay Informed: Follow Binance’s official announcements and community discussions for any updates or further information about these tokens. Conclusion: A Bold Move by Binance and a New Chapter for These Tokens Binance’s decision to list Mubarak, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale through its “vote to list” process is a fascinating development. It underscores the growing influence of community sentiment in the crypto space and Binance’s willingness to embrace diverse projects. While the nature of these tokens, particularly the meme coins, suggests a degree of speculative trading, the Binance listing provides them with a significant platform to reach a global audience. As trading commences at 9 p.m. (UTC) today, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how these new tokens perform and what impact they have on the broader market. This event serves as a reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency landscape, where community-driven initiatives and unexpected listings can create exciting new opportunities.

In response, crypto market traders and investors also speculate over looming price gains due to enhanced market exposure brought by a top CEX.

This means users can trade the coins against BTC, USDT, and other assets available on the platform at zero fees.

Its intraday low and high were $0.09159 and $0.158, respectively. While two of the coins mirror a bull run amid enhanced market support, two trade in the red zone. What’s More? CoinGape earlier reported that Binance completed its inaugural Vote To List program for these tokens. As a result, new trade offerings were unveiled today. However, it’s worth mentioning that a few traders have sparked a speculative buzz with their MUBARAK coin transfers amid new listings. Soon after the announcement, three addresses deposited 22.15 million tokens to the leading exchange, per ‘ai_9684xtpa’ on X. If sold, two addresses could see over 100 times the profit, adding a layer of intrigue to the crypto’s price movements and insider trading speculations.

As the digital asset space continues to expand, new opportunities emerge, bringing fresh excitement to investors. This time, all eyes are on a new meme coin presale that has already started making waves. While meme coins capture the spotlight, Terra Classic and Celestia have also made headlines with recent developments. Terra Classic’s network upgrades could impact its price action, while Celestia’s expansion into modular blockchain solutions has drawn investor interest. However, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is stealing the show. With a massive staking APY, lucrative referral incentives, and engaging community competitions, its meme coin presale is gaining momentum fast. This article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Terra Classic, and Celestia. Stake, Earn & Win Big with Arctic Pablo Coin’s 66% APY Rewards One of the biggest reasons Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) is the best crypto to invest in right now is its staking feature. During its meme coin presale, investors can lock in an impressive 66% APY, earning substantial passive income. But that’s just the start. APC’s ecosystem is designed to reward active participation. Holders who refer new investors can earn extra tokens through its lucrative referral program. Additionally, community competitions offer exciting opportunities to win APC or even USD rewards. With multiple earning avenues, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself as a high-reward project for early adopters. Given the meme coin presale’s growing traction, staking now could yield significant returns before its official launch. Arctic Pablo Coin Reaches Crystal Cove – The 16th Phase & Counting! The Arctic Pablo Coin meme coin presale is unlike any other. Instead of traditional stages, it follows a unique journey-based approach, progressing through different locations as Arctic Pablo “travels.” Now, the presale has reached Crystal Cove, marking its 16th phase and showcasing unstoppable growth. With previous locations selling out at record speed, APC has now surpassed $2 million in funds raised. The current price sits at $0.000083, offering an ROI of 9552.41% from this phase to the listing price of $0.008. As each location passes, the price rises, making this the last chance to enter at this discounted rate. Previous phases sold out sooner than expected, meaning Crystal Cove won’t last long either. With interest surging and price increases on the horizon, securing APC tokens now could be a game-changer before it moves to the next location. Terra Classic Sees Major Upgrade, Boosting Market Confidence Terra Classic (LUNC) has recently implemented a new network upgrade aimed at improving transaction efficiency and reducing gas fees. This upgrade comes as part of the project’s continuous efforts to rebuild trust after the historic collapse of the original Terra ecosystem. With enhanced scalability and security measures, Terra Classic developers hope to attract more users and projects back to the network. Market analysts speculate that these technical improvements could lead to increased adoption, potentially impacting LUNC’s price action in the coming weeks. Celestia Expands Modular Blockchain Adoption Celestia is making headlines as it continues expanding its modular blockchain ecosystem. The project recently announced new partnerships with emerging Web3 protocols, allowing developers to build more scalable applications using Celestia’s innovative infrastructure. By separating consensus from execution, Celestia’s architecture enables projects to customize their blockchains while maintaining security. With increased adoption and developer interest, Celestia’s role in the blockchain industry is growing, positioning it as a key player in the next wave of decentralized applications. Final Verdict: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge in the Meme Coin Presale Scene With Terra Classic enhancing its network and Celestia advancing modular blockchain technology, both projects remain intriguing prospects. However, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now . Its meme coin presale is moving fast, with Crystal Cove already underway, an attractive 66% APY staking reward, and an ever-growing community of investors. As prices climb with each new phase, now is the time to grab APC before the next location shift skyrockets its value.

To prevent losses for affected traders, the platform has confirmed that users who held long JELLY positions at settlement will be compensated $0.037555. However, flagged accounts will not be eligible for this refund. Hyperliquid: For users holding long JELLY positions at settlement, the Foundation will compensate them at a price of 0.037555. Hyperliquid will strengthen risk management: HLP will set limits on the Liquidator vault; if losses exceed the limit, ADL will be triggered; the open… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 28, 2025 What triggered the Hyperliquid liquidation incident involving the JELLY token? The issue started when a trader executed a self-trade of 4 million USDC in JELLY at a low price of $0.0095. This move caused JELLY’s price to surge more than four times, leading Hyperliquid’s backstop protection system (HLP) to step in and liquidate the position. However, this liquidation ended up causing losses to HLP’s account value. Although Hyperliquid had restrictions in place to prevent excessive open interest, the problem arose when HLP took control of the position. Instead of triggering automatic deleveraging (ADL) to manage the risk, the system continued operating as usual because it shared collateral across multiple vaults. This flaw exposed HLP to unexpected losses. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen criticized Hyperliquid’s handling of the March 26 incident, warning that its approach to risk management could turn it into “FTX 2.0.” She raised concerns over how the platform managed the liquidation event, suggesting it posed serious risks to the exchange’s stability. What changes is Hyperliquid making after the March 26 JELLY incident? Yesterday is a good reminder to stay humble, hungry, and focused on what matters: building a better financial system owned by the people. Hyperliquid is not perfect, but it will continue to iterate and grow through the collective efforts of builders, traders, and supporters.… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) March 27, 2025 Hyperliquid is making big changes to avoid another major issue like the one on March 26. The platform is tightening control over its Liquidator vault, which steps in when big trades go wrong. Now, it won’t be able to take on too much risk, and money from other vaults won’t automatically be used to cover losses. If losses go beyond a set limit, an emergency system (ADL) will kick in to stabilize things. Another important update is that trading limits (OI caps) will now adjust based on market size. This will prevent huge trades from causing sudden price spikes or crashes. On top of that, Hyperliquid will introduce a voting system where validators will decide whether to remove certain assets if they don’t have enough liquidity or market activity. These changes aim to make the platform safer and more stable for traders. What concern did Hung Dang raise about the Hyperliquid JELLY incident? One X user, Hung Dang, raises a critical point about the recent Hyperliquid incident, questioning what happens to users who withdrew from the Vault before the platform intervened. If they pulled out early, their losses would be their own, rather than being covered by the Vault operator. However, since they had no way of knowing whether Hyperliquid would step in, they were in a tough spot—potentially taking losses that others who stayed might have avoided. This highlights the uncertainty traders faced during the crisis. Overall, the JELLY incident was a wake-up call for Hyperliquid, revealing system loopholes that need stronger security measures. FAQ What Happened in the Hyperliquid JELLY Incident? A self-trade of 4 million USDC in JELLY at a low price caused a sudden price spike. Hyperliquid’s liquidation system responded, but it ended up losing funds instead of protecting them. Why Did Hyperliquid’s Risk System Fail? The failure happened due to shared collateral across multiple vaults and no trigger for automatic deleveraging (ADL). This design flaw led to unexpected platform losses. How Did the JELLY Token Price Spike So Drastically? A user executed a self-trade at $0.0095, pushing JELLY’s price up by over 400%.

Fartcoin hit the $1 billion mark in no time, and Dogwifhat’s Solana base and standout branding pushed it to rapid growth with a loyal holder base. But the question remains—how decentralized are they really? That’s where Dragoin ($DDGN) enters the conversation. Rather than riding a wave of memes alone, it plans to renounce its smart contract after launch—removing centralized authority altogether. It’s a move that might appeal to investors looking not just for hype, but for structure and security from day one. Fartcoin: Community-Driven Growth with Fast Results Launched on October 18, 2024, Fartcoin quickly turned heads with its AI-created concept rooted in humor. A unique reward system allowed users to earn tokens for sharing jokes, helping build a strong and fast-growing community. In just two months, Fartcoin’s market cap crossed the $1 billion mark. As of March 25, 2025, it trades at around $0.5245. While it has dropped 6.94% in the past 24 hours, it’s gained 88.18% over the past week. With close to 1 billion tokens in circulation, its market cap sits at approximately $524 million. Fartcoin’s performance shows what community energy can do—but its long-term structure raises some important questions about control and sustainability. Dogwifhat: Solana’s Meme Hit with Momentum Dogwifhat (WIF) launched in November 2023 on the Solana blockchain. With a Shiba Inu mascot wearing a knitted hat, it quickly became a recognizable and well-liked meme token. Its lighthearted branding and community-first feel sparked major interest. By February 2025, it had surged 60% in just one week. As of March 25, 2025, WIF is priced at $0.5488, up 0.49% in the last 24 hours and 16.35% for the week. With roughly 999 million tokens circulating, it holds a market cap of about $549 million. Dogwifhat’s growth has been impressive, but like many meme tokens, centralized controls still exist behind the scenes—something that may matter more to future investors. Dragoin’s Contract Renouncement Signals a Different Approach What sets Dragoin apart isn’t just the theme or community—it’s the mechanics. Dragoin has committed to renouncing its smart contract once it launches. This means the contract becomes immutable. No one—developers or insiders—can make changes, freeze the token, or interfere with liquidity. This isn’t a marketing statement. It’s a built-in protection. It eliminates the risk of rug pulls, stealth edits, or sudden shifts in control. For early-stage investors, that kind of commitment can’t be overstated. It turns Dragoin from just another meme coin into something potentially more reliable. In a time when many projects still reserve backend access, Dragoin’s approach shifts power entirely to its holders. The rules are baked into the code. No permissions. No exceptions. The design gives users the confidence that their holdings can’t be tampered with after launch. That’s not just good practice—it’s a strong message to the market. In the Long Run, Trust Might Be the Real Value Fartcoin and Dogwifhat show that community and viral momentum can bring fast results. Their rise reflects how effective meme branding can be in crypto—but both still depend on centralized oversight to some degree. Dragoin, by contrast, is choosing a more transparent path. Renouncing its contract post-launch shows that it’s not just playing into trends—it’s trying to build something solid. As investors become more cautious and seek tokens with real safeguards, Dragoin’s structure could give it an edge. The meme coin world will likely remain unpredictable. But Dragoin’s push for decentralized ownership might help it do more than just survive the cycle. It might just set a standard. In this space, trust isn’t earned through slogans—it’s written into the code.

Filed on Mar. 27, South Carolina’s Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act seeks to give the state treasurer the authority to hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets as a hedge against inflation. According to the bill , inflation has reduced the purchasing power of retirement funds and state-managed assets. To protect its finances, South Carolina wants to diversify them. Bitcoin is viewed as a possible hedge against economic volatility. The proposed Digital Assets Reserve would enable the state to own and manage Bitcoin while also allowing South Carolinians to voluntarily donate digital assets. The bill sets clear investment guidelines, requiring safe storage through cold wallets or certified custodians and capping holdings of digital assets at 10% of total funds under management. Additionally, the state is only permitted to hold a maximum of 1 million BTC.

The state treasurer would be required to publish public addresses of the reserve’s holdings to maintain transparency and enable citizens to confirm transactions. The proposal comes as South Carolina pushes to reverse its stance on crypto regulation. On a Mar. 27 post on X, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal revealed that the state has dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase’s staking services, paving the way for the exchange to relaunch staking for residents.

He pointed out that 52 million Americans own crypto and need clear rules and consumer protections. Grewal praised South Carolina for its decision and said he hopes other states with staking bans will follow.

Kennedy Grills Paul Atkins on SBF Pardon Rumors,https://coinpaper.com/8254/sen-kennedy-grills-paul-atkins-on-sbf-pardon-rumors,"Kennedy warned that SBF cannot receive any preferential treatment and also called for stricter action against SBF and his family. Meanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz introduced the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act” to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency, due to privacy concerns. In South Korea, a court temporarily lifted a business suspension that was imposed on major crypto exchange Upbit. This now allows it to resume onboarding new users despite ongoing legal battles and regulatory scrutiny over alleged KYC and anti-monopoly violations. No Special Treatment for SBF US Senator John Kennedy grilled prospective SEC chairman Paul Atkins during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on March 27. He specifically focused on the possibility of a presidential pardon for Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried. Kennedy is a Republican from Louisiana, and directed a series of pointed questions at Atkins. These questions specifically addressed reports that SBF’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, were seeking a pardon for their son. The senator also raised concerns about donations made by the Bankman-Fried family to Stanford University and called on the SEC to take action to ensure there are no double standards in the application of justice. Sen. Kennedy questioning Atkins Kennedy was especially frustrated with what he described as SEC inaction, and also vowed to continue pressing the agency on the matter. He argued that SBF and his family should not be treated differently from other Americans, stating, “They are crooks, and I expect the SEC to do something about it.” Speculation about a possible pardon gained more traction after reports surfaced in January that SBF’s family was seeking clemency from the newly elected US President Donald Trump. These efforts happened in the wake of Trump’s decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road marketplace. However, experts cast doubt on the likelihood of SBF receiving a similar pardon. William Livolsi, executive director of the White Collar Support Group, pointed out that the cases differ quite a bit as Ulbricht’s crimes were non-violent and victimless, while SBF’s actions led to billions of dollars in losses for investors. (Source: Truth Social) Despite facing a lengthy prison sentence, SBF recently tried to realign himself politically by granting interviews to conservative media outlets. In February, he spoke with The New York Sun and followed up in March with an interview with Tucker Carlson . However, the latter interview was not approved by prison authorities, and resulted in SBF being placed in solitary confinement and transferred from a New York prison to a facility in Oklahoma. Cruz Introduces Another Bill to Ban CBDC Other US lawmakers are also trying to make a difference in the crypto space. US Senator Ted Cruz introduced new legislation on March 26 that is aimed at preventing the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The proposed bill is called the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act,” and will block the Fed from offering digital financial products or services directly to American citizens, effectively banning the creation of a retail CBDC. This move is very similar to a bill that was reintroduced earlier in March by Representative Tom Emmer, a Republican from Minnesota. In fact, both bills place a lot of emphasis on the need to preserve the privacy protections associated with traditional cash and coins. First page of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act The Federal Reserve has been researching the potential for a digital dollar since 2020, with at least four projects currently underway. However, Cruz consistently opposed the idea of a CBDC, and introduced related legislation multiple times since 2022. He openly voiced his concerns about the government using digital currency to exert greater control over citizens’ financial lives. Emmer shares similar concerns, and called CBDC technology “inherently un-American” and even warned it could threaten personal freedoms. Emmer speaking about CBDCs at a House Financial Services Committee Hearing Critics argue that CBDCs could lead to mass surveillance and increase the government’s ability to monitor financial activity. Despite this very strong opposition in the US, several countries around the world are continuing to explore or develop their own CBDCs. In Europe, lawmakers are advancing plans for a digital euro despite low consumer interest. Israel also shared preliminary designs for a digital shekel, and Iran is reportedly preparing to launch a CBDC. In the US, resistance to CBDCs is still very strong. President Donald Trump pledged to block the creation of a digital dollar, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that no CBDC will be issued under his leadership. While CBDC proponents argue that digital currencies could improve the efficiency of financial systems, critics fear the centralization of money supply and the erosion of individual privacy. Court Suspends FIU Ban on Upbit Services Meanwhile, the crypto landscape in South Korea is changing as well. A South Korean court temporarily lifted a partial business suspension that was imposed on the country’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit. This allows the platform to resume onboarding new clients while the legal dispute unfolds. The suspension was originally issued by South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) on Feb. 25, and it barred Upbit from accepting deposits and withdrawals from new customers for three months. The FIU claimed the penalty was due to Upbit’s alleged violations of rules prohibiting transactions with unregistered virtual asset service providers (VASPs). After the suspension, Dunamu, Upbit’s parent company, filed a lawsuit against the FIU looking to overturn the order and requested an injunction to suspend the enforcement of the restriction. On March 27, local media reported that the court granted the injunction, and delayed the suspension until 30 days after a final court ruling. Overall, this latest development allows Upbit to continue servicing new users in the interim. Upbit has operated since 2017, and is facing broader regulatory scrutiny beyond the recent suspension. In October of 2023, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) launched an investigation into the exchange over potential violations of anti-monopoly laws. Additionally, the FIU accused Upbit of breaching Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, identifying between 500,000 and 600,000 potential KYC violations during a review of the exchange’s business license renewal. The exchange is also suspected of facilitating approximately 45,000 transactions with unregistered foreign crypto platforms, which is in violation of South Korea’s financial transaction reporting laws. South Korea’s regulators have greatly increased their efforts to tighten control over the crypto industry, particularly when it comes to cross-border transactions. In late 2024, Finance Minister Choi Sang-Mok announced new reporting requirements for businesses handling international digital asset transactions, which is aimed at curbing tax evasion and currency manipulation. As part of this crackdown, Google Play blocked the apps of 17 crypto exchanges at the FIU’s request, with additional steps being taken to restrict access through internet platforms and Apple’s App Store.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|FIAT|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 06:06:00

PI’s community quickly picked up the positive price actions, which came after weeks of consecutive retracements, and outlined bullish predictions. Less than a week after its official launch on February 20, PI skyrocketed to a fresh all-time high at $3 on February 26. However, its momentum quickly evaporated, and the asset went south hard. In the following month, PI plunged by over 70% and dumped to under $0.75, which many analysts highlighted as an important support zone that could lead to a price reversal. This seems to be the case so far, as PI has risen by over 14% since that local bottom. On a daily scale alone, the asset is up by 4.1%, according to data from CoinGecko. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko Although 4% doesn’t sound like much, especially when considering its overall crash in the past month, it’s particularly impressive given the fact that almost the entire crypto market is in the red today. BTC is down below $86,000 once again, while alts such as DOGE, LINK, SHIB, DOT, APT, and ICP have dropped by over 5%. PI’s growing community praised the price reversal, and some projected an immediate surge to $1.2. Others highlighted the growing trading volume, which could be considered a good sign as well in an environment of low activity in the broader market. Perhaps what’s most bullish in regards to PI’s price movements is the fact that the token’s exchange deposits have slowed down to roughly a million, compared to the massive numbers registered over the past month. At one point, there were over 300 million PI tokens transferred to centralized exchanges, which increases the selling pressure immediately. $PI exchanges deposits are finally slowing down. In the last 24 hours only 1M $PI was deposited.

According to a recent report by Watcher.Guru on X, BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund has disclosed holdings amounting to a staggering $47.4 million in these newly accessible investment vehicles. This revelation not only highlights BlackRock’s confidence in Bitcoin but also marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for further institutional capital influx and broader mainstream acceptance. Let’s dive into what this explosive news means for the future of crypto investment and the role of Bitcoin ETFs . BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Investment: What Happened? The buzz started when Watcher.Guru, a prominent crypto news source, reported on X about BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund’s latest disclosure. This wasn’t just a minor allocation; $47.4 million directed towards spot Bitcoin ETFs is a significant sum, especially coming from a fund as renowned as BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund. For those new to the term, a spot Bitcoin ETF is an investment fund that directly holds Bitcoin. This is in contrast to futures-based ETFs which invest in Bitcoin futures contracts. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by regulatory bodies was a landmark event, making it easier for institutional investors and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes this announcement noteworthy: Magnitude of Investment: $47.4 million is a substantial initial investment, signaling serious intent from BlackRock. Fund Significance: The investment is through BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund, a fund known for its diversified portfolio and strategic asset allocation. Spot ETF Impact: Investing in spot Bitcoin ETFs reflects a belief in the long-term value and stability of Bitcoin as an asset. Institutional Validation: BlackRock, being the world’s largest asset manager, lends immense credibility to crypto investment as a whole. This move by BlackRock isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger trend of institutional investors gradually warming up to cryptocurrencies. However, BlackRock’s entry at this scale is particularly impactful due to their sheer size and influence in the financial world. Why is BlackRock’s Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs a Big Deal? The question on everyone’s mind is: why is this $47.4 million investment causing such a stir? The answer lies in the credibility and influence that institutional investment giants like BlackRock bring to the table. Here’s why this development is profoundly significant: Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class: BlackRock’s investment acts as a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a viable asset class. When a firm of BlackRock’s stature allocates capital to Bitcoin ETFs, it sends a strong signal to other institutions and investors that Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a maturing asset worthy of consideration in diversified portfolios. Increased Institutional Adoption: This move could trigger a domino effect, encouraging other large institutional investors who have been hesitant to enter the crypto space to now explore Bitcoin ETFs . Fear of missing out (FOMO) in the institutional world is a real phenomenon, and BlackRock’s action might just be the catalyst needed to unlock further institutional capital. Enhanced Market Liquidity and Stability: Significant institutional investment can inject substantial liquidity into the Bitcoin market. Increased liquidity can lead to reduced volatility and greater market stability, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors. Broader Mainstream Acceptance: BlackRock’s involvement can accelerate the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As traditional financial institutions embrace Bitcoin, it becomes more integrated into the conventional financial system, reducing the perception of it being a fringe or risky asset. Essentially, BlackRock’s investment is not just about the $47.4 million; it’s about the symbolic weight and the precedent it sets for the future of crypto investment . It’s a clear indication that institutional walls are breaking down, and Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a legitimate part of the global financial landscape. The Benefits of Spot Bitcoin ETFs for Investors Spot Bitcoin ETFs have emerged as a game-changer for both institutional and retail investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin. But what makes them so appealing? Here are some key benefits: Accessibility and Convenience: Spot Bitcoin ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to investors with brokerage accounts. You don’t need to navigate crypto exchanges, manage private keys, or worry about crypto wallets. It’s as simple as buying shares of a stock. Regulatory Compliance and Security: ETFs are regulated investment products, offering a layer of security and compliance that might be reassuring, especially for institutional investors and those wary of the unregulated nature of direct crypto ownership. Custody and security of the underlying Bitcoin are managed by the ETF provider. Diversification Tool: Bitcoin ETFs provide a straightforward way to diversify investment portfolios. Bitcoin has shown low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, making it a potentially valuable tool for risk management and enhancing portfolio returns. Tax Efficiency (Potentially): Depending on your jurisdiction and investment strategy, investing in Bitcoin through an ETF might offer certain tax advantages compared to direct Bitcoin ownership. It’s crucial to consult with a tax advisor for personalized advice. Lower Barrier to Entry: For investors intimidated by the technical complexities of buying, storing, and securing Bitcoin directly, spot Bitcoin ETFs significantly lower the barrier to entry. You can invest in Bitcoin without needing deep technical knowledge of blockchain or cryptocurrency. In essence, spot Bitcoin ETFs democratize access to Bitcoin investment, making it more approachable, secure, and convenient for a wider range of investors. BlackRock’s investment is a testament to the growing recognition of these benefits within the institutional investment community. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Crypto Investment While the news of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF investment is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective and acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with crypto investment . The cryptocurrency market, while promising, is still relatively nascent and comes with its own set of uncertainties: Challenge/Risk Description Volatility The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility. Bitcoin prices can experience significant swings in short periods, which can lead to substantial gains but also losses. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations can significantly impact the market and the value of crypto assets. Market Manipulation Compared to traditional markets, the crypto market can be more susceptible to manipulation due to its relatively smaller size and fragmented nature. Security Risks While ETFs mitigate some security risks related to direct Bitcoin ownership, the underlying Bitcoin held by the ETF is still subject to security threats, although managed by professional custodians. Technological Risks The technology underlying cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Potential technological disruptions or vulnerabilities could impact the value and stability of Bitcoin. Investors considering Bitcoin ETFs or any crypto investment must conduct thorough research, understand their risk tolerance, and ideally consult with a financial advisor. Diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risks in the volatile crypto market. While spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a more regulated and accessible route to Bitcoin exposure, they are not risk-free investments. How to Leverage Spot Bitcoin ETFs for Portfolio Diversification For investors intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin but seeking a more traditional and regulated investment avenue, spot Bitcoin ETFs can be a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. Here’s how you can consider leveraging them: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before investing in Bitcoin ETFs , honestly evaluate your risk tolerance. Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, and you should be comfortable with the possibility of price fluctuations. Determine Allocation Size: Decide what percentage of your portfolio you want to allocate to Bitcoin ETFs . Financial advisors often recommend starting with a small allocation, especially when venturing into new asset classes like crypto. Integrate with Existing Portfolio: Consider how Bitcoin ETFs fit within your existing investment portfolio. Given Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets, it can be used to potentially enhance portfolio diversification and reduce overall risk. Long-Term Perspective: Approach Bitcoin ETFs with a long-term investment horizon. Cryptocurrency markets can be unpredictable in the short term, but many investors believe in the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as needed. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , backed by institutional interest like BlackRock’s, offer a compelling way to incorporate Bitcoin into a diversified investment strategy. However, prudent investing always requires due diligence, risk management, and a clear understanding of your investment goals. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investment BlackRock’s $47.4 million investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a resounding declaration of confidence in Bitcoin and the future of digital assets. This move by the world’s largest asset manager signifies a maturing crypto market, attracting serious institutional investment and moving closer to mainstream financial integration. For investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a more accessible, regulated, and convenient pathway to participate in the potential growth of Bitcoin, albeit with a clear understanding of the inherent risks involved. As institutional adoption continues to gain momentum, we are likely witnessing the dawn of a new chapter in the evolution of crypto investment , where digital assets become increasingly intertwined with the traditional financial world.

He said this forecast stands regardless of whether or not there is more clarity on US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and potential recession concerns.

Coutts based his rosy rebound prediction on easing financial conditions, a weakening US dollar and the People’s Bank of China ramping up liquidity since early 2025. “Financial conditions have eased dramatically this month, highlighted by the US dollar’s third-largest three-day decline since 2015 and significant drops in rates and Treasury bond volatility,” he said. “Liquidity remains central to investing in all asset classes,” he added. Bitcoin is down 3.16% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $85,880, down 3.16% over the past month, as per CoinMarketCap data. Coutts referred to his March 7 X post, where he said that based on the US Dollar Index (DXY) recent moves through a “historical lens,” it makes it hard to be “anything but bullish” about Bitcoin. Based on historical DXY performance, Coutts said that by June 1, Bitcoin's 90-day forecast ranges from a worst-case price of $102,000 to a best-case scenario of $123,000. Source: Jamie Coutts The upper target would represent a 13% gain over its current all-time high of $109,000 , which it reached on Jan. 20. BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick , recently said that Bitcoin will most likely thrive in a recessionary macro environment. “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin,” Mitchnick said in a March 19 interview with Yahoo Finance. Related: $16.5B in Bitcoin options expire on Friday — Will BTC price soar above $90K? It comes at the same time that Bitcoin continues to experience its “least bullish conditions” since January 2023, according to CryptoQuant. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is at 20, its lowest since January 2023, signaling a weak Bitcoin market with low chances of a strong rally soon. Based on historical performance, if the score remains below 40 for an extended period, it could signal continued bearish market conditions, similar to previous bear market phases.

This move promises to reshape how investors interact with global markets, offering a level of flexibility previously unseen in traditional finance. By leveraging blockchain technology, D-ETF aims to dismantle geographical and temporal barriers, opening up new avenues for both retail and institutional investors. Breaking the Time Barrier with Blockchain The conventional stock market operates within rigid schedules, often leaving investors vulnerable to overnight market fluctuations. This limitation has historically disadvantaged those unable to react promptly to breaking news or global events. D-ETF’s solution lies in its integration of blockchain technology, allowing for decentralized and continuous trading. This infrastructure facilitates constant market access, empowering investors to execute trades at their convenience, regardless of time zones or traditional market hours. The benefits of this approach are manifold. Firstly, investors gain the ability to react instantly to market-moving events. For example, if a significant economic announcement occurs outside of standard trading hours, investors can capitalize on the information immediately, rather than waiting for the next trading day. This capability is particularly crucial in today’s fast-paced, interconnected global economy, where news travels rapidly and market reactions can be swift. Secondly, the platform fosters borderless trading, enabling global participation without regional market hour restrictions. This democratization of access is facilitated by the inherent nature of blockchain technology, which transcends geographical boundaries. Furthermore, the 24/7 trading environment enhances market liquidity, as continuous trading opportunities contribute to improved price efficiency. The decentralized infrastructure also provides enhanced security and transparency, ensuring that transactions are tamper-proof and easily verifiable. Empowering Investors with Enhanced Control and Accessibility D-ETF’s mission extends beyond simply offering continuous trading. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance. By providing an all-in-one platform, D-ETF eliminates the need for users to navigate multiple brokerage accounts and cryptocurrency exchanges, streamlining the investment process. This consolidation is designed to simplify investing for both novice and experienced traders, making it more accessible and manageable. The platform’s commitment to innovation is evident in its continuous expansion of offerings, including real-world asset tokenization. This initiative reflects a broader trend in the financial sector, where traditional assets are being represented on blockchain networks to enhance liquidity and accessibility. By tokenizing real-world assets, D-ETF is opening up new investment opportunities and democratizing access to previously exclusive markets. Joel Felice Kuck, CEO of D-ETF, highlights the platform’s transformative potential, emphasizing its role in “reshaping how investors interact with traditional financial markets.” This vision of empowering global investors with greater flexibility and control is central to D-ETF’s operations. The platform’s focus on security, efficiency, and innovation positions it as a key player in the evolving financial landscape.",Information,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 06:51:54

Top Analyst Hints at Massive Rally!,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-gearing-up-for-a-surge-top-analyst-hints-at-massive-rally/,"The post Altcoin Season Gearing Up for a Surge? Top Analyst Hints at Massive Rally! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is still recovering from its March crash, but a major Altcoin rally could be on the horizon. Crypto analyst Crypto Rover has spotted a key pattern hinting at a massive breakout. While the fear & greed index is in fear zone, many believe an explosive altcoin season could be next. Altcoins Poised for Massive Surge? According to Crypto Rover’s analysis , altcoins are currently moving between Fibonacci levels 1 and 1.272, just like they did before the big rally in 2021. Back then, once altcoins broke above the 1.618 Fibonacci level, the total market cap soared from $240 billion to $1.8 trillion. The Fibonacci retracement tool is often used by traders to find important price levels. When prices move between these levels for some time and then break out, it can lead to a strong rally. Now, in 2025, a similar pattern is forming. Crypto Rover’s chart highlights a key resistance level that altcoins are struggling to break. If they manage to push past it, it could trigger another massive rally. If history repeats itself, altcoins could see a huge surge, and the total market cap might even explode to nearly $9 trillion. Altcoin Season Index Stands At 18 The Altcoin Season Index tracks the price movements of the top 50 altcoins to determine if an altcoin season has begun. Usually, when the index reaches 75% or higher, it signals the start of an altcoin season. Right now, Blockchain Center reports the Altcoin season index is at 18 , meaning altcoins are not in control. At the same time, Bitcoin’s market dominance has risen to 62% , showing that investors prefer Bitcoin over altcoins. This suggests the market is in a Bitcoin season, where altcoins find it hard to match Bitcoin’s performance.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 06:56:05

Notably, the dip comes as market watchers eagerly await the upcoming US PCE inflation data, which might provide clarity on the Fed’s future stance with their rate cut plans. However, with the ongoing gloomy sentiment in the market, veteran trader Peter Brandt hints at a possible BTC crash to $70K ahead. Bitcoin Price Slips: What Lies Ahead? BTC price today was down more than 1.4% during writing and slipped below the $86,000 mark. Its trading volume from yesterday also recorded a slump of 2.4% to $25.8 billion. Notably, Bitcoin price has touched a 24-hour high and low of $85,837.93 and $87,702.17. However, a BTC price prediction showed that the crypto might end this month with a recovery to the $88K level. Despite that, Bitcoin Futures Open Interest was down over 1.5%, indicating a waning risk-bet appetite of the traders. Peter Brandt Hints At Bitcoin Price Crash Amid the ongoing gloomy momentum recorded in the broader crypto market, veteran trader and market expert Peter Brandt hints towards a potential BTC price crash ahead. For context, in a recent analysis on X, expert HTL-NL showed a chart that indicates BTC’s potential crash to $76,700 or even to around $70,000. Source: HTL-NL Sharing the analysis, Brandt said , “This is not an unreasonable expectation.” It indicates that the expert also believes that BTC might face strong selling pressure, which could send it to around the $70K level. Will The Bulls Dominate After US PCE Inflation Release? The current dip appears to be due to the investors staying on the sideline ahead of the crucial US PCE inflation release, scheduled for later today. Having said that, if the US PCE inflation comes in tandem with the market expectations, it could significantly boost the market sentiment. Notably, the declining inflationary pressure could help the US Fed to move with a dovish policy rate plan. Usually, the lower rates help boost the traders’ confidence, which in turn could drive the Bitcoin price higher. Meanwhile, analyst Javon Marks also shared a bullish forecast recently. In a recent X post, Marks highlighted BTC’s previous surge from $19K to $67,543. Comparing that with the current level, the expert predicted that BTC could hit between $116,600 and $118,800 if the history repeats. Besides, a flurry of other experts also anticipates a potential BTC breakout to a new ATH ahead. For context, Michael van de Poppe in a recent X post said that Bitcoin’s “Drops getting absorbed quickly and buying pressure is building up.” Source: Michael van de Poppe, X Considering that, he hinted towards a strong run for the flagship crypto in Q2. However, some have argued that for the bullish momentum to continue, the Bitcoin price must breach the crucial $90K support ahead.

The analyst outlined a potential Elliott Wave structure, suggesting that XRP is amid a third wave, targeting a price range between $5.85 and $8.076. A fifth wave is projected to push XRP’s price between $18.22 and $23.20. Dark Defender made it clear that this analysis is not financial advice. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Resistance Breakout and Fibonacci Extensions The accompanying chart illustrates the breakout of a long-term resistance trendline, suggesting that XRP has surpassed a key level that previously hindered its price growth. The chart also aligns with Fibonacci extension levels, which are commonly used in technical analysis to predict price targets based on past movements. A 161.8% Fibonacci extension aligns with a price level of approximately $1.88, while the 261.8% extension coincides with the $5.85 target, and the 361.8% extension points toward the $18.22-$23.20 range. Higher Time Frames Indicating Long-Term Strength Dark Defender’s analysis reinforces the significance of higher time frames in determining market trends. While lower time frames may exhibit volatility, the broader trend can provide a clearer picture of potential price movements. The tweet suggests that the coming months could be pivotal for XRP’s long-term trajectory , especially if it follows the projected Elliott Wave pattern. Awaiting the Three-Month Candle Closure on March 31 The analyst concluded the tweet by stating, “Well, time will tell!”—acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in market predictions. The closing of the current three-month candle on March 31 will be a key moment for traders monitoring XRP’s price action . Whether the asset continues its upward momentum or faces resistance remains to be seen, but Dark Defender’s analysis suggests a strong bullish case based on technical indicators.

In the civil lawsuit filed against the former kickboxer, the model alleges that Tate physically assaulted her at the Beverly Hills Hotel on March 11. Stern’s allegations have sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency industry. Interestingly, in the last seven days, the SISTER meme coin has experienced a growth of 5.4%. Here is everything you should know. Key Allegations: What Stern Claims Happened at the Beverly Hills Hotel Through her social media handles, Stern states that she met Tate as part of a modelling project. She claims that Tate casted her as a model for his meme coin, DADDY. She also notes that he promised her to support her meme coin, SISTER. While explaining the horrific experience she had to go through in the Beverly Hills Hotel, she reveals that what started as a consensual physical relation turned violent when Tate began physically, verbally and mentally assaulting her. This is not the first time that Tate has faced a serious allegation of this nature. He, along with his brother Tristan, is facing serious criminal cases in Romania. Stern was admitted to a New York hospital after the horrific incident. As per an image published by an acclaimed media outlet, she was diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome, which is a set of symptoms that may continue for weeks, months or years after a concussion. This suggests that Stern may have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury during the incident. The lawsuit, which has the accurate details of the severity and nature of the injuries she suffered during the incident, has not yet been published by authorities. Tate’s Response: Legal Team Calls It a ‘Blatant Cash Grab’ Tate has not yet publicly responded to Stern’s allegations. A legal team, appointed by Tate, has dismissed the allegations as a ‘desperate attempt’ to exploit their client. Crypto Market Reaction: SISTER Meme Coin Surges In the 14 days, the SISTER meme coin market has experienced a surge of over 12%. In the last seven days alone, the market has grown by around 5.4%.

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 82,800 YouTube subscribers that technical analysis indicators are signaling that Bitcoin could break out from the long-term downtrend that started in December of 2024. Svenson says that on both the four-hour and the daily time frame, a downtrend line is converging with an uptrend line, a phenomenon that is also being replicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that’s used to determine oversold and overbought conditions. “…so we’re getting a break above horizontal resistance on the daily RSI and the long-term downward sloping resistance. So there is a breakout now confirmed on the daily RSI. And this may be a leading indicator, a leading signal that Bitcoin may also create a breakout in the near term.” According to Svenson, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a momentum-based technical indicator that is used to determine trends and pinpoint potential buy and sell points, is also flashing a bullish signal for Bitcoin. “On the daily MACD, the bulls have the momentum as we’re resting right upon resistance. This could give us a reason to believe that we may see a breakout…” The crypto analyst also says that Bitcoin has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern on the three-day time frame and could go up by around 13% from the current level. “To get your target for the measured move, you go from the high to the low of the [ascending triangle] pattern and then extrapolate that onto the potential breakout zone… which is actually giving us a pretty stunning number. I mean $98,000… I guess it’s not too crazy to believe because we had this huge dump. We would basically just be regaining that lost ground from that big week down that we saw. So right now we may just create a U-shaped recovery that seems to be what we’re setting up for now.” Bitcoin is trading at $86,551 at time of writing.

A popular analyst on X outlined what needs to happen for the asset to kickstart its bull run, but XRP is not very close to it now. $2 or $3 Next? The price movements from XRP in the past several weeks have been quite underwhelming aside from a few brief spikes after Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement in mid March as well as when Trump mentioned it to be potentially included in the States’ strategic crypto reserve. As of now, XRP struggles at $2.25 after a 4% daily decline. This is far off the $3.4 local peak reached in mid January, ahead of Trump’s inauguration, when the cryptocurrency came just 1% away from breaking its 2018 all-time high. Despite the hype , the regulatory changes, the SEC lawsuit conclusion , and everything in between, XRP has not only failed to remain above $3 but it has lost its position as the third-largest digital asset to Tether’s USDT. With its price now sitting 33% lower than this cycle’s high, Ali Martinez outlined what needs to happen for XRP to restart its bull run. To invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, Ripple’s cross-border token needs to surge past $3, which seems like a distant target now. If $XRP can break above $3, it would invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially flipping the outlook bullish. pic.twitter.com/B6mrtXm1TS — Ali (@ali_charts) March 28, 2025 In contrast, Martinez highlighted $2 as a critical support level that needs to hold; otherwise XRP risks dumping toward $1.25. What’s Holding XRP Back? As CryptoPotato recently reported , everything seems to be going Ripple’s way. It’s not just the SEC lawsuit ending, or the hype around a potential US-based spot XRP ETF, or the friendlier administration. There’s more as the company considers an IPO while it also racks up new partnerships. However, XRP has failed to feel the positive impact in terms of price actions. It is closer now to the $2 support than the $3 resistance. Trading volumes have declined as even whales seem to be sitting on the sidelines , unlike what happened after the US elections. This could all be attributed to the overall market stagnation and the global economic uncertainty prompted by Trump’s controversial actions ever since he took office. Or, there could be more to the story that is yet to be unveiled to the public.

The overall demand for stablecoins has gradually increased in the past few weeks, as short-term holders find themselves under increasing financial pressure. The wider altcoin market has followed Bitcoin (BTC) price in correction mode after the flagship coin was rejected above $88k in the past few days. Chainlink, a large-cap altcoin with a fully diluted valuation of about $14.7 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $451 million, dropped nearly 6 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $14.75 on Friday, March 28, during the early trading session for the Western financial markets. Chainlink Price Expectations in Coming Weeks Since the beginning of 2025, Chainlink price has been trapped in a falling logarithmic trend, coupled with lower highs and lower lows in the daily timeframe. As a result, the LINK price is likely to retest the lower border of a rising channel, around $13, in the coming weeks. However, if the LINK price consistently closes above the resistance level of around $16, the bearish sentiment will be invalidated. Chainlink buyers must, however, flip the 100 and 200 Simple Moving Averages (SMA) into bullish sentiment to invalidate further downside risk. Closer Look at LINK Fundamentals Chainlink has seen a jump in social dominance across crypto social media following its hosting of a private meetup with key US government leaders.

According to on-chain data analysis from Santiment, long-term holders of Chainlink, with an account balance of between 10k and 10 million LINK, now have an all-time high balance of about 438.33 million coins.

According to data from crypto.news, Tutorial ( TUT ) rose from $0.0167 to an intraday high of $0.0564 before pulling back to $0.0396 by Friday afternoon in Asia. The rally extended its weekly gains to an impressive 2,600%, making it one of the top-performing altcoins over the period. The surge was backed by high trading activity, with on-chain data showing a 600% increase in daily volume, which crossed $189 million. TUT’s market cap stood at $38.5 million. Interest from derivatives traders also spiked, with CoinGlass reporting a 400% jump in open interest for TUT futures, reaching $73.59 million at the time of writing. Today’s gains were mostly fueled by community hype after TUT secured a listing on Binance. It was picked in the first round of the exchange’s “Vote to List” campaign , alongside other memecoins like Mubarak (MUBARAK), CZ’s Dog (BROCCOLI714), and Banana For Scale (BANANAS31). According to the platform’s official announcement, the memecoins, exempt from a listing fee, can now be traded against USDT and USDC pairs, with withdrawals opening on March 28 at 21:00 UTC. A seed tag has been applied to them. You might also like: Coinbase cleared in South Carolina as state drops staking lawsuit Traders are currently divided on what’s next. Some think a sell-off might be coming, which isn’t unusual after a major exchange listing, especially since the hype is often baked into the price before the listing even goes live. As reported by crypto.news, after getting listed on KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bitget on March 20, TUT rallied over 330% to hit a record high of $0.057. But the rally was short-lived as within 24 hours, the token lost nearly half its value as early buyers took profits. Still, not everyone is bearish. Technical analysts like gemxbt_agent are pointing to a bullish structure on the charts. According to their March 27 X post , TUT recently broke out of a consolidation pattern and formed a possible double-bottom reversal. Key support was noted around $0.03, with potential upside targets between $0.06 and $0.065. TUT price analysis On the 4-hour chart (TUT/USDT), the price recently formed a God candle followed by a few red candles, which usually hints at some selling pressure kicking in after the pump. TUT price, Supertrend and MACD chart — March 28 | Source: crypto.news Still, the Supertrend indicator just flipped green and is sitting above the price, which usually means the bullish momentum is still in play. That could open the door for another leg up. The MACD is also looking strong, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. On top of that, the Chaikin Money Flow is showing a positive reading, suggesting that fresh capital is still flowing into TUT. TUT CMF and RSI chart — March 28 | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, the RSI has cooled off a bit, dropping back to around 60 after hitting overbought levels. This means selling pressure might be fading, giving bulls more room to take control again. If momentum continues, TUT could make another push toward the $0.06 resistance level, the same spot it struggled to break on March 20. That said, there could be another round of selling before it gets there. Per CoinGlass, TUT’s weighted funding rate was negative at press time, meaning the majority of derivative traders were betting on a price correction.

The move follows the company’s court-approved bankruptcy wind-down plan and a $4.47 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Terraform’s portal, claims.terra.money, will be live from 31 March 2025 through 30 April 2025 at 11:59 pm ET, giving affected users a one-month window to submit claims. Terra 🌍 Powered by LUNA 🌕 @terra_money · Follow Terraform Labs Creditors: The Crypto Loss Claims Portal is scheduled to open for submission of Crypto Loss Claims on March 31, 2025. Creditors may file Eligible Crypto Loss Claims at claims.terra.money . The deadline to file is April 30, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. (prevailing Eastern 10:11 am · 28 Mar 2025 109 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The recovery process is part of broader efforts to compensate investors after the 2022 collapse of TerraUSD and Luna triggered an estimated $40 billion in losses across global markets. TerraUSD claims process The Crypto Loss Claims Portal will allow creditors to submit claims by registering and verifying their ownership of impacted assets. Users with holdings in the Terra ecosystem, including supported networks, must complete a free on-chain transaction as verification. For other networks, Terraform recommends providing a read-only API key, though manual alternatives such as transaction logs or account statements will be accepted with longer review times. Claims will be evaluated by the Plan Administrator based on the user’s verified holdings. Assets under $100 in on-chain liquidity, and certain excluded tokens like Luna 2.0 on Terra 2.0, are ineligible for reimbursement. Review and payouts Once a claim is submitted, it will be reviewed by the Wind Down Trust, the entity overseeing Terraform’s bankruptcy process. Creditors can expect an update or final claim amount within 90 days of the 30 April deadline. Those who receive a final decision can either accept or dispute the amount via the same online portal. Claims that are accepted without dispute will qualify for pro rata payments. Distribution will begin as soon as funds become available, although exact payment dates have not been disclosed. Terraform has clarified that any payments to the SEC under its legal settlement will only occur after approved creditor claims are addressed. Bankruptcy and SEC settlement In September 2024, Terraform Labs was granted court approval to begin its formal liquidation process. This followed a significant fraud verdict in April that led to a $4.47 billion settlement with the SEC. The agreement came after Terraform and co-founder Do Kwon were found responsible for misleading investors and triggering the Terra ecosystem’s implosion. The settlement amount will be partially covered by Kwon’s assets, which include PYTH tokens and other holdings, though regulatory fines will only be paid after creditor obligations are fulfilled. The bankruptcy plan’s primary goal is to recover and redistribute funds to victims, prioritising those who suffered financial losses in the 2022 crash.

The intense competition in the Ethereum (ETH) layer two (L2) ecosystem, following the introduction of newer scaling solutions led by Optimistic rollup and zk Rollups, has increased the overall challenge for the OMG Network.

This groundbreaking move combines traditional finance with blockchain technology, enhancing transparency, security and liquidity. ETFs Set To Launch In April Powered by HashKey Chain, this project is set to revolutionize the future of asset management and digital finance. Notably, the Bosera HKD Money Market ETF and Bosera USD Money Market ETF, approved by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), will officially launch in April. The Bosera HKD and USD Money Market ETFs are part of Hong Kong’s Project Ensemble Sandbox, which explores the tokenization of real-world assets. As a member of this initiative, HashKey Group will continue working with the HKMA and SFC to advance Hong Kong’s tokenized ecosystem. These money market ETFs, known for low risk and high liquidity, combine traditional stability with the flexibility of blockchain technology, offering an innovative investment product for efficient cash management. Low-Risk Blockchain-Based Investment Options Bosera’s tokenized money market fund uses blockchain to offer greater transparency and efficiency, giving investors direct access to high-quality money market assets. Ideal for DeFi and virtual asset investors, it acts as a “yield stabilizer.” HashKey Group provides full tokenization support, with the product deployed on HashKey Chain for secure asset management. It will be distributed through HashKey Exchange, Hong Kong’s largest licensed platform, with additional custody services via the Earn Channel. “Bringing money market ETFs on-chain through blockchain technology is a crucial step for traditional finance to embrace Web3,” remarked Dr. Xiao Feng, Chairman and CEO of HashKey Group.

Crypto majors tracked by the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) showed a 4.5% slide on average, led by DOGE at 7%. Toncoin’s TON was the only token in the top-20 by market capitalization in the green with a 5% rise in the past 24 hours. Gold surged to fresh highs Friday with a jump above $3,109 in Asian morning hours, continuing a stellar rise since early March. The MSCI World Index had its longest losing streak in a month, per Bloomberg, while a regional gauge of Asian equities was poised for its biggest drop since Feb. 28. Over $12.2 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) options will expire with max pain at $85,000 later Friday. “Spot is trading sideways and OI continues to bleed lower, signalling a broad lack of near-term optimism in the market,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast. “With the PCE Index data due tomorrow, we believe any short-term upside remains capped as markets wait for clarity from Trump's next move in this escalating trade war.” The PCE index captures inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflects changes in consumer behavior. Released monthly, the PCE is said to influence Fed interest rate decisions. High PCE readings signal rising inflation, potentially prompting rate hikes to cool the economy, which can reduce risk appetite and pressure bitcoin prices downward as investors favor safer assets. Conversely, low PCE data suggests tame inflation, possibly leading to rate cuts or steady policy, boosting liquidity and supporting Bitcoin’s price as a speculative asset or inflation hedge. The next release is on March 28 and could sway market sentiment, with bitcoin’s reaction tied to how the data shapes Fed expectations — volatility often follows as traders adjust positions. Markets have been heavy since Thursday as President Donald Trump warned of deeper tariffs on Canada and the European Union in case the two collude and policies impact U.S. economic activity. In turn, Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada said late Thursday the country would move rapidly to trade more with other countries as the U.S. was “no longer a reliable partner.” “The global market is highly sensitive to monetary policies set by major economies, particularly the United States,” Innokenty Isers, Chief Executive Officer at Paybis, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “﻿With its relatively higher volatility, risk-averse investors may favor alternative inflation hedges instead of Bitcoin.” “Considering the longer stretch of the trade war and the potential inflation that will emerge, capital allocation to BTC as a hedge against economic instability might be reduced,” Isers warned.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-28 07:20:53

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told CoinDesk in an interview that the ""impending gateway regime"" that is earmarked for 2026 will in fact be a new authorization regime for crypto companies. ""We will have a gateway which will allow authorization. But obviously we've got to go through those consultations, create those rules and get the legislation for that to take place,"" Long said. This regime will be a leap from the current anti-money laundering (AML) one. Firms like crypto exchanges Coinbase , Gemini and Bitpanda will move away from just needing to register with the country to comply with anti-money laundering rules to an authorization regime with rules for a suite of offerings. This will require them to go through a fresh process to secure approval from the FCA. The FCA intends to release papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and more this year. The regime is expected to go live after final policy papers are published in 2026, Long said. Since its anti-money laundering register for firms opened in 2020, the FCA received 368 applications from firms wishing to comply, but only 50 firms — 14% of applicants — have been approved so far. Many firms may have to start again. Read more: U.K. Financial Regulator Aims for Crypto Regime by 2026 Regulated activities Upcoming legislation will define what counts as a regulated activity, the FCA's Long said. Companies that engage in those activities will need to seek authorization. In 2023 the former U.K. government released papers that said regulated activities would likely include crypto and fiat-referenced stablecoins issuance as well as payment, exchange and lending activities . Stablecoins will no longer be brought under the U.K. payments regulations as set out in previous work, former Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq said in November . The FCA plans to consult on draft rules for stablecoins early this year. ""What we're doing in terms of the stablecoins is we're making sure that we take the best from the current regulation that exists in TradFi, but stablecoins are ultimately unique,"" Long said. ""There isn't anything that is exactly the same. We've got to adapt the regulation that we've currently got."" Read more: UK to Draft a Regulatory Framework for Crypto, Stablecoins Early Next Year Transition The FCA is still deciding on the process crypto companies will need to go through to get authorized, Long said. Long added that it was undecided what steps those who are already registered in the money laundering regime will need to take but the new regime will come with wider permissions,"" so we'd expect that if you wanted the further permissions, you'd apply for them."" Therefore companies may need to go through a lengthy registration process — even if they've already secured an existing license. ""We'll be communicating with firms about what the gateway will look like before it goes live, our intention is to bring it live as soon as humanly possible,"" Long said referring to the authorization regime. In formulating how it intends to move forward, the regulator plans to also look at Europe which has launched bespoke legislation for the crypto sector and the International Organization of Securities Commissions' 18 recommendations . IOSCO will soon be publishing a piece on how countries are progressing with its standards, someone familiar with the matter said. ""It's a case of understanding and looking for best practice,"" Long said.

More than 7400 holders have captured tokens during the ongoing third phase, which makes the project a serious contender for both established rivals, such as Cardano, as well as recent meme-based movers like Pepe Coin (PEPE). Currently at $0.025 in Phase 4 — a phase that is filling out quickly — the token will see a 20% jump to $0.03 at the trade of Phase 5. For early supporters this equates a 140% launch gain, with MUTM’s initial trade price fixed at $0.06. Post-launch rallies are seen pushing the price to $3.50 due to the coin’s lending infrastructure and undiluted buy pressure, analysts forecast. Rapid Demand as Presale Momentum Builds With each presale phase locking in higher entry points, Mutuum Finance investors are scrambling get in on the ground floor of this ascending presale opportunity. Having increased 66% from its debut, the current price of $0.025 is still below its listing target of $0.06. Those who buy today will lock in a 2.4x return at launch and post-listing predictions could see a jaw-dropping 2,400% profit if prices reach $3.50. This trajectory is as much as 10x faster than speculative tokens like PEPE that derive value solely from meme virality with no underlying utility. In contrast, Cardano’s slow development cycle is a far cry from MUTM’s nimble presale campaign, which has already harnessed a community that rivals PEPE in size and activity. Innovative Mechanics Create Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance differs in approach with a dual-feature lending model which combines decentralized loans and yield farming. Users can deposit assets like ETH or DAI into the vault, where they receive interest-bearing mtTokens (mtETH, mtDAI) that appreciate over time. A section of those wBTC tokens can then be traded or staked across multiple DeFi platforms, adding liquidity without liquidating assets. Loans are accessed by locking and overcollateralizing reserves, this design reduces the risk of default and naturally stabilizes the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer feature facilitates direct negotiations for specialized assets (e.g., DOGE or SHIB) that would otherwise be impossible or impractical in traditional lending pools. Cash flows from Platform fees activate buy-and-distribute strategy with stable demand channel directed at acquiring MUTM. Then, these tokens are distributed to stakers, which incentivize holding long term, while putting a brake on selling. Such mechanics stand in stark contrast with PEPE’s volatility or Cardano’s increased sluggishness with protocol upgrades — balancing aggressive growth with structural safeguards for investors. Mutuum Finance merges speculative attraction with practical utility, in contrast to PEPE Coin’s meme-based approach and Cardano’s academic focus. The giveaways ($100,000 for early testers) and presale success highlight a community that believes in its roadmap. The team is in the final stages of a Certik audit of its smart contracts, results of which will come shortly through official channels. Such transparency builds trust, which calms fears often found in newer projects. Final Call for Early Entry Mutuum Finance’s Phase 4 window is starting to close, presenting one of the final chances to acquire tokens below $0.03. As Phase 5’s 20% price increase nears and exchange listings are on the horizon, the project’s unique blend of DeFi and strategic tokenomics ensures it is set for massive gains following these events. As the crypto market pivots towards utility-driven assets, MUTM’s combination of lending utility, buy pressure, and community momentum may set new expectations for altcoins in 2025. Be sure to lock in your place before this next round starts—any investors sitting on the fence now will lose out on the lowest entry point still left for this presale cycle. Stay tuned to Mutuum Finance social channels for audit updates and the final phase announcements.

Galaxy Digital , a crypto investment firm founded by Michael Novogratz , has agreed to a $200 million settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office over allegations it promoted the algorithmic cryptocurrency LUNA ( LUNA ) while quietly selling millions of tokens at a profit. The firm did not admit or deny the allegations. The settlement, outlined in a filing from the NYAG, claims Galaxy bought LUNA in 2020. At the same time, it promoted and sold its holdings without disclosing its intent to sell, thereby violating the Martin Act and New York Executive Law, according to the NYAG. In the settlement agreement, the regulator says Michael Novogratz was among LUNA’s most vocal supporters, admitting in a moment that Galaxy “helped ‘kickstart’ interest in Luna through its marketing efforts.” You might also like: Mike Novogratz: FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried ‘needs to be prosecuted’ While publicly expressing confidence in LUNA, Galaxy queitly sold “millions of tokens into the market at many multiples of its initial cost without disclosing that it was selling,” the filing reads. Galaxy reportedly bought 18.5 million LUNA tokens at a discount and sold most of them in tranches, making over $100 million by March 2022. By the time LUNA collapsed in May 2022, Galaxy had already exited almost its entire position. “Ultimately, Galaxy helped a little-known token increase its market price from $0.31 in October 2020 to $119.18 in April 2022, while profiting in the hundreds of millions of dollars,” the NYAG claims. Under the settlement, Galaxy will pay $200 million over three years, starting with $40 million in two weeks. The firm also agreed to implement policies to prevent conflicts of interest, including legal analysis of token investments and promotional statements.

These dashboards included insights into income sources, expense categories, an income statement, and a treasury runway projection. While some view the current losses as a natural phase of Arbitrum ’s growth strategy, Entropy Advisors stresses the importance of smart spending to secure sustainable expansion.

Among these, L2 surplus fee was the major revenue driver according to the data shared by Entropy Advisors.

According to Entropy Advisors, the gross revenue has decreased and the DAO’s profit has been relatively unchanged as a result of margin expansion. The DAO also plans to increase its spending by including Timeboost as a revenue stream in the near future, and currently, the DAO is voting on that decision. Timeboost and Nova Fee Sweep have been touted to be income streams for the Arbitrum DAO. Timeboost has been in existence since 2024 and enables auctions for the rights to an express lane on both Arbitrum One and Nova, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion. Incentives take the lead Incentives are the Arbitrum DAO’s biggest expense at $141M (85%). Source: Entropy Advisors The DAO’s expenses came in the form of blockchain-related costs such as Orbit developer guild payments; DAO operations such as DAO expansion programs, development and consulting services among others; incentive programs; financial management expenses such as treasury management and finance functions; grants such as event sponsorships, technology development, retroactive allocations and structured programs, among others. According to the data presented by Entropy Advisors, apart from blockchain costs, incentives were the largest expense source, taking up to $141 million (85%). This is followed by grants, which took up to $13 million. Despite running at a loss since 2023, 2025 is expected to be Arbitrum DAO’s most profitable year yet, driven largely by a reduction in incentive spending.

In a recent interview on FOX Business, shared by crypto analyst AllinCrypto, Garlinghouse emphasized that the current financial infrastructure is still heavily reliant on SWIFT , a system that has been in place for decades. He pointed out that the cross-border payments market involves trillions of dollars in transactions and that new technologies can enhance efficiency. Garlinghouse explained that despite the slow pace of change, the opportunity to modernize financial systems is significant. He stated that government resistance to innovation in the United States has historically hindered progress. However, he noted that this situation is shifting, which he attributed to what he called “the Trump effect.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says SWIFT architecture is outdated and is confident that $XRP will usher in a new era of finance across the globe: ""there's an opportunity to modernize"" ""The Trump effect is profound."" pic.twitter.com/v7msnhyCVN — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) March 25, 2025 The Impact of the Trump Administration on Crypto Adoption According to Garlinghouse, President Donald Trump’s reelection has substantially impacted the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector. He stated that market conditions have already reflected this shift and expects further advancements in the adoption of emerging financial technologies. He pointed out that Ripple has experienced a surge in business activity within the United States since Trump’s election. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Garlinghouse revealed that in the six weeks following Trump’s victory, Ripple secured more deals in the U.S. than in the prior six months. He described this as a significant shift and suggested that many people have underestimated the scale of change that is now underway. He predicted that blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies will play a long-term role in transforming financial infrastructure, not just in payments but also in real estate and securities transactions. The Future of Ripple and Financial Innovation Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple is already seeing increased domestic interest, marking a departure from when much of its growth came from international markets. He believes that this trend will continue as the U.S. regulatory environment evolves. Garlinghouse expects financial technology innovations to unfold over the next decade or more. He indicated that these advancements will fundamentally reshape how transactions are settled across multiple industries. While acknowledging that progress takes time, he remained confident that the U.S. financial system is now “unlocked” and on a path toward widespread modernization. His comments reflect a broader expectation that blockchain-based solutions, including those leveraging XRP, will gain traction as businesses and institutions seek more efficient alternatives to legacy financial systems.

Dogecoin’s recent double-digit pump and Shiba Inu’s massive uptick in active wallets have sparked renewed hype across crypto forums and TikTok threads. With altcoin season heating up and retail money pouring back into meme assets, all eyes are on the next wave of viral coins that could deliver massive returns. But one meme coin has flipped the script— Arctic Pablo Coin. It doesn’t just ride hype; it builds a story. Arctic Pablo isn’t a stage-based presale. It’s a full-blown mythical journey. Each presale phase is a new “location” Pablo travels to, unlocking mysteries, igniting the community, and burning tokens left behind like breadcrumbs in the frost. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Adventure Token Built for Massive Returns In a world dominated by static tokens and cookie-cutter memecoins, Arctic Pablo Coin is a mythical phenomenon with serious profit potential. With every move Pablo makes globally—through icy caverns, mystic beaches, and lost ruins—a new presale location opens, giving new investors a shot at riding this frosty wave early. Currently stationed at Crystal Cove—its 16th mysterious location— Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is priced at just $0.000083. Over $2 million has already been raised, and with a listing price of $0.008, early investors could be staring down a jaw-dropping 9552.41% ROI. That means a simple $100 investment today could morph into $9,638.55. If there was ever a time to get in, it’s now—because this location could close out any moment. With a total supply of 221.2 billion tokens, Arctic Pablo has allocated 50% to public presale and built out its ecosystem with crystal-clear intent. Marketing, development, staking, and community rewards are hardcoded into the tokenomics. And for diamond hands? A 66% APY staking program is ready to reward true believers. Stake those tokens and stack gains while the Pablo story unfolds—staking will be vested for two months post-launch. As the only meme coin combining mythical storytelling, deflationary mechanics, high APY, and location-based scarcity, Arctic Pablo Coin is rewriting what meme coins can be. Early believers are already stacking six-figure gains. And with each new location, that opportunity resets for the next wave of holders. This presale location won’t last forever. Arctic Pablo could advance to the next location at any moment, which means the current $0.000083 price is the last low point before the next jump. This is the ticket for anyone eyeing top new meme coins for massive return potential . Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin Still Has Gas in the Tank It’s wild to think that Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013 and now holds a market cap north of $24 billion. As of March 2025, DOGE has rallied yet again—up 38% month-over-month—thanks to Elon Musk’s continued love affair with it and integration whispers with X (formerly Twitter). When Dogecoin moves, the entire meme coin ecosystem wakes up. Dogecoin’s current price hovers around $0.17, a far cry from its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73, but this distance also signals upside room. Traders are eyeing a breakout to the $0.25-$0.30 range with enough momentum. And the best part? DOGE still has that crazy community drive behind it—meme armies, Reddit raids, and TikTok takeovers. While it lacks the deflationary elements or staking rewards that newer meme coins offer, Dogecoin survives purely on brand legacy and memetic power. It’s liquid, listed everywhere, and commands respect. Anyone looking for top new meme coins for massive return potential shouldn’t underestimate the OG—it’s still barking. Shiba Inu: From Meme to DeFi Powerhouse Shiba Inu has come a long way from being dubbed the “Dogecoin killer.” With the launch of Shibarium—its Layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum—the project has evolved into a serious DeFi contender. As of March 2025, SHIB sits around $0.000025 and is up nearly 45% YTD. That’s not just hype—that’s utility in motion. Shiba Inu’s diversified ecosystem makes it one of the top meme coins for massive return potential. It’s not just SHIB anymore—there’s LEASH, BONE, and now a complete NFT platform, staking dApps, and governance structure through Doggy DAO. This multi-pronged ecosystem attracts DeFi users, NFT collectors, and meme traders. Shibarium has helped solve the Ethereum gas fee issue for SHIB users while accelerating adoption across dApps. SHIB burns are also increasing, with deflationary effects similar to Arctic Pablo—though not as frequent or predictable. This keeps SHIB relevant in conversations about sustainable long-term value. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on This Meme Coin Gold Rush Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the top new meme coins for massive return potential. Its mythical storytelling, weekly token burns, 66% APY staking, and a presale model that travels through Earth’s mysteries make it not just a coin—but a movement. Dogecoin remains the legendary gatekeeper of the meme coin world, while Shiba Inu continues building its DeFi kingdom brick by brick. But Arctic Pablo Coin? That’s where the magic’s happening now. With over $2 million already raised, a price of just $0.000083, and a projected ROI of 9552.41%, this could be the final moment to jump in before the next presale location bumps the price. Join the Pablo meme coin presale now and become part of crypto’s most legendary expedition. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs: What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin uses a location-based presale journey, weekly token burns, and 66% APY staking—offering a mix of narrative and real ROI. How much can you earn by investing in Arctic Pablo Coin now? Investing $100 now could yield $9,638.55 by launch, based on the current price of $0.000083 and listing price of $0.008. Is Dogecoin still a good investment in 2025? Yes, Dogecoin remains highly liquid, community-driven, and continues to gain momentum with social media backing.

The firm also said that it will add up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari. The car company said it can withstand President Trump’s upcoming tariffs since its wealthy customer base is unlikely to be discouraged by higher prices. Ferrari’s stock prices surged slightly Thursday morning, reaching 391.50 euros at the time of publication, a 1.82% surge. Ferrari increases prices by 10% in response to U.S. auto tariffs We're screwed — Ferrari Plans to Raise US Prices Up to 10% After Tariffs Hit Ferrari NV plans to raise prices for some of its cars by as much as 10% to deal with US President Donald Trump’s latest auto tariffs. https://t.co/AITnUE5vAk — Jim Bianco (@biancoresearch) March 27, 2025 Italy-based sports car maker Ferrari revealed that it will hike the price of certain models by 10% to countermeasure Donald Trump’s auto tariffs. The car company disclosed that it will increase prices up to $50K for a typical Ferrari. The firm also maintained that prices will remain unchanged for all cars imported before April 3, the day Trump’s tariffs are expected to take effect. The Italian luxury sports car maker said that after that, the “commercial terms” for three of its model families, the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, will “remain unchanged.” “For the current remaining models, the new import conditions will be partially reflected on pricing, up to a maximum 10 per cent increase, in coordination with our dealer network.” – Ferrari The company said popular models, including the Purosangue SUV, the 12Cilindri and the F80, will get price increases of up to 10%. Ferrari’s Purosangue, which is priced around $430,000, will have a price hike of about $43,000. The firm’s limited edition F80, which starts above $3.5 million, will get a price increase of more than $350,000. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued 25% tariffs on all cars not made in the country. More than half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as well as 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the country. The Italian luxury sports car maker runs all its auto production at its Maranello factory in Italy, in the province of Modena. The car automaker revealed last year it produced 13,752 cars. The Italy-based firm also plans to launch its first all-electric Ferrari in October. Ferrari’s upcoming EV vehicle, which will be manufactured in Italy, is among six new models the firm plans to launch this year. Ferrari’s 2025 financial target remains unchanged The company did not provide more information on the effect the tariffs will have on its sales since most of its vehicles have already been on a waiting list for more than a year. Ferrari also highlighted on March 27 that its financial targets for 2025 will remain unchanged but added that there was a potential reduction of 50 basis points in profitability percentage margins. The Italian luxury sports car maker has also forecasted adjusted earnings of around 2.68 billion euros ($2.88 billion), a surge of at least 5%. The firm also forecast a net revenue of more than 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for the full year. Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said earlier this month that even though its buyers are wealthy, the firm has to be sensitive to passing on too much of the added cost of tariffs. The car company also reported a significant increase in 2024 net profit and cited a strong product mix and growing demand for personal touches to its vehicles. JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a Thursday note that they envision some Ferrari buyers will decide to delay taking delivery. Bernstein analyst Stephen Reitman argued that U.S. customers won’t be pushed away by higher prices. He believes that Ferrari’s customers tend to be wealthier individuals who will be less impacted by tariffs, which will put more pressure on poorer customers. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman also lowered the December price target for General Motors (GM) to $53 per share from $64 per share, for Ford Motors to $11 per share from $13 per share, and for Ferrari to $460 per share from $525 per share. Brinkman also suggested that the auto industry might take an annual hit of $82 billion, up from an initial estimate of $41 billion, assuming that automakers absorb the cost of the tariffs. The analyst also believes light-vehicle prices could surge by up to 11.4% if companies decide to pass the cost on to consumers. Ford CEO Jim Farley stated in February that “let’s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While Hayes has long stressed the crucial role of liquidity in driving the Bitcoin price, his latest remarks go even further, suggesting a new phase of expansion is imminent. Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle Is History Hayes believes that Bitcoin’s original four-year “halving cycle” framework has been overshadowed by the asset’s ascent into mainstream financial consciousness. According to him, early on, Bitcoin’s market dynamics were more closely tied to mining profitability cycles. However, those days appear largely gone: “Now that Bitcoin and crypto are a bona fide asset class…everyone’s responding to it,” Hayes said. “It has transitioned from this technological digital bearer asset into the best smoke alarm for fiat liquidity that we have globally.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Make Big Moves As Bullish Momentum Resurfaces Rather than focus on halving events, Hayes urges investors to track how many dollars, euros, yen, and yuan are actively being created—or destroyed—by the world’s major central banks. In his view, the Federal Reserve, the People’s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank drive the most significant flows: “All I care about is fiat liquidity. As long as we believe [Bitcoin] works, then it just comes down to how many fiat things are in the denominator, and then you just get to the price.” According to Hayes, markets are underestimating the US Federal Reserve’s willingness to revert to looser monetary policy far sooner than publicly stated. He calls recent Fed moves “stealth printing,” arguing that Chair Jerome Powell is quietly laying groundwork to keep credit conditions easy—even though official language still references inflation concerns. Hayes pointed to signs in the Fed’s communications that quantitative tightening (QT) will slow or even pause. One such indicator is Powell’s mention of offsetting any reduction in mortgage-backed securities with fresh purchases of US Treasuries: “They said they might taper QT to be flat That’s very positive for dollar liquidity.” He also noted Powell’s statements that any inflation arising from tariffs would be considered “transitory”—in effect granting the Fed cover to maintain accommodative policies: “Tariffs don’t matter anymore to Powell, and they shouldn’t matter anymore as crypto investors […] because we know that Powell’s going to continue to provide the monetary conditions […] that we need to have our portfolios go up in value in fiat dollar terms.” The Bottom Is (Probably) In In Hayes’s estimation, the worst of Bitcoin’s recent downturn may already be behind us. Although he concedes that the market could still retest lows, he contends that Bitcoin has likely established a key floor: “On balance, we probably hit a bottom of 76,000 […] Does that mean that we’re not going to retest it? No, of course not, but if I had to make a bet, I would bet that we go higher rather than lower.” For Hayes, this is a question of recognizing a turning point in monetary policy. Once the Federal Reserve and other central banks signal they are fully done tightening—“or never truly started,” in his phrasing—he expects Bitcoin to climb. Related Reading: One Of Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Buy Signals Just Flashed Hayes also dismissed the idea that looming crypto regulations in the United States or elsewhere could meaningfully stifle Bitcoin’s trajectory. He believes Bitcoin’s permissionless, decentralized design makes it effectively impervious to traditional regulatory blockades: “Crypto regulation doesn’t matter. Bitcoin doesn’t need anyone’s permission. It’s moving with or without them […] If Bitcoin trades on tradfi regulations, then I don’t want to own it. I want something immune to regulation.” In one of his most attention-grabbing statements, Hayes contemplated whether Bitcoin could achieve “a numerically interesting number”—including the possibility of $1 million—during the next wave of dollar-driven liquidity. Although he did not definitively lock in an exact price ceiling, he mentioned that it might be a psychologically resonant figure: “I put $1 million Bitcoin out there- I hope it will be $1 million dollars but you know maybe it’s just 666,000 or 500,000 or 250,000 what some round number that the human mind sees as significant, for some arbitrary reason.” For Hayes, it comes down to global monetary authorities deciding they have “gone too far” in trying to rein in spending and inflation. Once central banks resume large-scale liquidity injections, he argues, the stage is set for rapid upside in Bitcoin’s price. Arthur Hayes’s perspective centers on the idea that Bitcoin’s fate hinges almost exclusively on global liquidity conditions. He remains convinced that central bankers, especially at the Fed, are closer to providing a renewed wave of monetary stimulus than the market believes—paving the way for a dramatic Bitcoin rally. While volatility remains inherent, Hayes insists that the largest cryptocurrency is poised to move swiftly once the policy backdrop aligns. “If you know what to look for, the clues are everywhere. The bottom is in, liquidity is coming back, and Bitcoin… it’s already turning the corner.” Where that corner leads, according to Hayes, could be as high as $1 million—starting, he suggests, as soon as April. At press time, BTC traded at $85,765.

While it has currently stabilized at around $0.10, the latest price action has pushed its weekly gains to nearly 40%. This rise in CRO’s value comes on the heels of a major development involving Crypto.com, the parent company behind the cryptocurrency. SEC Ends Probe into Crypto.com The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially closed its investigation into the crypto exchange and has informed the company that no enforcement action would be taken against it. This marks a major moment after months of tension between the two entities. In October 2024, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC after receiving a Wells notice, which indicated the regulator’s intent to sue the platform for operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and securities clearing agency. The lawsuit argued that the SEC had unlawfully extended its jurisdiction and imposed an overreaching rule classifying nearly all crypto transactions as securities trades, regardless of how they were sold. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek publicly condemned the regulator’s actions and called for an end to its overreach. However, by December 2024, Crypto.com dropped its lawsuit, a month after the re-election of Donald Trump as US President. The SEC, under the Biden administration, had previously targeted various cryptocurrency companies, including Kraken, Coinbase, and Uniswap, with enforcement actions and lawsuits. However, after Trump returned to office, the legal landscape for crypto companies shifted dramatically, with many cases being shut down. Following the development, Nick Lundgren, Chief Legal Officer of Crypto.com, accused the SEC of weaponizing and attempting to expand its congressionally granted power to harm an industry that its former chair “disfavored.” The exec even went on to add, “It is unfortunate that we were forced to endure this years-long investigation and file our own suit against the SEC to protect the rule of law. Compliance and integrity are core to Crypto.com’s business and we are excited to work with soon-to-be-confirmed Chair Atkins and the rest of the Commission on our long-awaited desire for legislation and rulemaking.” Backlash Over Re-Issuance of 70 Billion CRO Tokens Crypto.com was recently under fire for the re-issuance of 70 billion CRO tokens, which sparked fierce criticism from the crypto community. For instance, ZachXBT, a prominent blockchain investigator, accused the company of betraying its users, and claimed the move was no different from a scam. This controversial decision resurrected tokens that had been burned in 2021 to decrease the total supply. Critics argue that it goes against the community’s wishes for decentralization and transparency, with reports indicating that Crypto.com’s validators control a large portion of the voting power. Despite this, Marszalek defended the decision, stating that it was necessary to support the company’s growth strategy.

Among the largest unsecured creditors are Alexander Svanevik of Standard Crypto and Ashley Swaren, a commercial lead at TokenTerminal. In January 2024, Terraform Labs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., reporting assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. By September 2024, a U.S. bankruptcy court approved the company’s plan to wind down its operations following a $4.47 billion settlement with the SEC over fraud allegations related to the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin. The SEC alleged that in 2021, Terraform Labs and Do Kwon misled investors about TerraUSD’s ability to maintain its $1 peg. Specifically, after TerraUSD dropped below $1 for the first time in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform secretly arranged for a third party to purchase large amounts of TerraUSD to restore its peg, while publicly misrepresenting the recovery as a result of the algorithm’s effectiveness. The agency also claimed that Kwon and the company falsely stated that Terraform’s blockchain was integrated into a widely used Korean mobile payment app Chai.

UST was an algorithmic stablecoin, meaning it wasn’t backed by reserves like cash or assets. Instead, it relied on a mint-and-burn mechanism with its sister token, LUNA. When UST demand increased, LUNA was burned to mint new UST. Conversely, when UST supply needed to shrink, UST was burned to mint LUNA. In early May 2022, large withdrawals from Anchor Protocol (a lending platform that offered 20% APY on UST deposits) created sell pressure on UST. UST started to depeg from $1, dropping to $0.98, then lower. Traders panicked and rushed to sell UST, causing even more instability. To restore UST’s peg, Terraform Labs minted massive amounts of LUNA to absorb the sell-off. But this flooded the market with LUNA, causing its price to plummet from $80+ to fractions of a cent. Even after Terraform Labs deployed $3 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserves to restore UST’s peg, it failed. Co-founder Do Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 and was extradited to the U.S. in late 2024, facing fraud and money laundering charges.

The problem resulted from a rogue trader who self-traded a sizable JELLY position, which caused a price spike, setting off a liquidation process that led to Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) market-making vault absorbing the loss. In a Mar. 27 post on X, the platform outlined several steps it has taken to improve its risk management. Stricter limits on the liquidator vault, which serves as an emergency fund to cover losses from failed trades, is one of the key updates. By reducing the cap, Hyperliquid hopes to keep the vault from assuming undue risks that could compromise the platform’s overall stability. Vault rebalancing has also been decreased. In the past, risk was harder to predict because frequent rebalancing led to sudden changes in exposure. Slowing down this process should create a more stable risk management system. Another major improvement is how liquidation vault triggers work. Before, if the liquidator vault took a loss, it would automatically pull funds from other vaults. Now, if losses reach a certain level, automatic liquidation will kick in. Instead of distributing risks to other vaults, this update helps to contain them. You might also like: Bitget CEO says Hyperliquid could become FTX 2.0 amid JELLY incident Hyperliquid is also improving its open interest caps, which set the maximum amount that traders can bet on a single asset. Now, these caps will dynamically adjust according to market conditions, lowering the chance that the system will be disrupted by sharp price swings. Furthermore, validators will be able to decide when to remove risky assets through a new voting system. To avoid further issues, a token may be delisted if it drops below safety thresholds. Hyperliquid continues to face difficulties despite these updates. According to DeFi Llama data , the total value locked in its liquidity vault has dropped from a peak of $540 million in February to $180 million as of Mar. 28. USDC outflows, which surpassed $340 million just hours after the hack, are continuing, with 61.7 million USDC leaving the platform in the last 24 hours, as per Parsec data . HYPE is struggling to recover as well. The token was trading at around $16 before the incident. It has now fallen to $13.98 as at the time of press, a 3% decrease over the past 24 hours and 59.83% below its peak of $34.96. Additionally, there has been a significant drop in HYPE trading activity, with volume dropping 79.8% to $94.3 million over the past day.

This decision aligns with many companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and others. Interestingly, the investors initially took it as positive news, but later, the GME stock price plunged. What’s happening, and will it recover? Why Did the GME Stock Price Crash 25% Today? In contrast to the GME stock price’s 16% rally on March 26, it has crashed by 25% today. The earlier boost came right after the announcement as investors considered it a highly bullish opportunity. Interestingly, along with this, the GameStop-inspired GME memecoin price surged 30%. At that time, the Gamestop short sale volume surged to $30.85M on March 27 after a massive 234% volume surge. Interestingly, this level was closer to the 2021 short squeeze. Additionally, the GameStop stock trading volume peaked amid the price surge. However, this all came falling with Gamtesop’s plan to raise $1.3M to buy Bitcoin for its treasury. The investor’s sentiments were impacted as the company is issuing debt to buy as they intended to offer $1.3M aggregated principal convertible senior notes due in 2030. The same reaction was noticed during MicroStrategy’s note issues. Experts co-relate these events before predicting a massive GME stock price uptrend. In 2021, MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes, the stock dipped after the announcement due to hedging shorts, but later exploded when Bitcoin ripped and the arbitrage unspooled. What’s Experts Take on GameStop Bitcoin Buying? Although there are mixed sentiments around this GameStop Bitcoin buying news, experts have appreciated this approach. Margia Smith has called it “a zero-risk, likely zero-dilution move that puts cash reserves > $6B.” However, other fears that GameStop could lose money if the price of Bitcoin drops. This is because Ryan Cohen, the chairman, took the interest-free loan, but he still owes the money until 2030, and anything can happen between this. Experts also believe that this strategy could impact the GameStop stock price’s short squeeze. They claim that if the price increased, the bondholders would prefer to convert their bonds. As a result, the share supply will increase and impact the squeeze in a limiting manner. Additionally, the institutions can convert their bonds to hedge their losses. This empowers them to control the stock uptrend. Besides, the biggest question is whether the downtrend will continue. Will GME Stock Price Recover? Considering the MSTR stock’s bullish rally with Bitcoin buying, it is anticipated that GameStop stock’s long-term trajectory will be bullish. For now, the $1.3M loan has affected investors’ sentiments, resulting in bearish liquidity. However, this downtrend will continue for some time, as several technical factors highlight the possibility of a crash to $16.83. This is because if the selling pressure continues, this is key support carrying liquidity. Additionally, Nasdaq has implemented the Short Sale Restriction (SSR), which will expire soon. As an impact, the short seller would re-enter the market aggressively, which could result in a further GME stock price crash. After a quick bounce-test on $GME sees continued bearish liquidity. With LDPM-L7 (brown line) failing to support, the next step is LDPM-L1 (pink line) at ~$16 Not to mention, bond conversion poses risks due to conversions, dilution, and continuously pressuring market sentiments. If all the factors align, the price may crash, but the increased buyer pressure may bring different results The post Why GME Stock Price Plunged 25% After Bitcoin Treasury News & Will It Recover? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|GameStop Stock|gme stock,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-28 08:14:05

This audacious bid, first reported by CoinDesk, isn’t just about rescuing a company facing Chapter 11 bankruptcy; it’s a bold vision to revolutionize decentralized science (DeSci) and place individuals firmly in control of their most sensitive information: their genetic data. Why is the Sei Foundation Eyeing a 23andMe Acquisition? The Sei Foundation’s interest in 23andMe stems from a desire to propel the burgeoning field of decentralized science (DeSci) into the mainstream. DeSci aims to leverage blockchain technology to create more transparent, accessible, and equitable scientific research ecosystems. Acquiring 23andMe, a company holding genetic information of approximately 15 million individuals, presents a unique opportunity to apply blockchain’s capabilities to a vast and valuable dataset. This isn’t simply about mergers and acquisitions; it’s about fundamentally reshaping how scientific data is managed and utilized. Here’s a breakdown of the potential motivations: Democratizing Access to Genomics Data: Currently, access to large-scale genomic datasets is often restricted to large institutions and corporations. Blockchain technology could enable secure and privacy-preserving data sharing, potentially accelerating research and innovation in personalized medicine and beyond. Empowering Individuals with Data Ownership: A core tenet of blockchain is user empowerment. Acquiring 23andMe would allow the Sei Foundation to explore mechanisms for individuals to have greater control over their genomics data , deciding who can access it and for what purposes. This contrasts sharply with the current centralized model where individuals often have limited agency over their personal data. Advancing Decentralized Science (DeSci) Initiatives: The acquisition would serve as a powerful catalyst for DeSci. By integrating a massive real-world dataset with blockchain infrastructure, the Sei Foundation could pioneer new models for scientific collaboration, funding, and data management within a decentralized framework. Strategic Asset Acquisition: 23andMe, despite its bankruptcy filing, remains a valuable asset. Its vast genomics data repository and established brand recognition are significant. Acquiring it at a potentially reduced price due to its financial situation could be a strategic move for the Sei Foundation. The Enormous Potential of Genomics Data on Blockchain Imagine a future where your genetic information isn’t locked away in corporate silos but is securely stored and controlled by you, potentially on a blockchain. This vision, while still in its early stages, is what the Sei Foundation seems to be pursuing. The convergence of genomics data blockchain technology holds immense promise across various sectors: Area Potential Benefits of Blockchain Integration Personalized Medicine Tailored treatments and preventative measures based on individual genetic profiles, shared securely with healthcare providers. Drug Discovery Accelerated research through secure and efficient sharing of anonymized genomic data among researchers and pharmaceutical companies. Agricultural Advancements Improved crop yields and disease resistance through genomic analysis of plants and animals, facilitated by blockchain-based data sharing. Scientific Research Faster and more transparent scientific discoveries through open and verifiable access to research data and findings. However, this ambitious endeavor is not without its challenges. Navigating the Complexities and Challenges Integrating genomics data blockchain technology and acquiring a company like 23andMe presents a complex web of challenges that the Sei Foundation must address: Data Privacy and Security: Genetic information is incredibly sensitive. Ensuring robust data security and privacy is paramount. Blockchain offers cryptographic security, but careful design and implementation are crucial to prevent breaches and misuse. The recent data breaches at 23andMe highlight the critical importance of this aspect. Regulatory Hurdles: The regulatory landscape surrounding genetic data and blockchain is still evolving. Navigating HIPAA, GDPR, and other data privacy regulations across different jurisdictions will be a significant undertaking. Scalability and Performance: Handling and processing massive genomics data sets on a blockchain requires a scalable and high-performance infrastructure. Ensuring the blockchain network can handle the demands of genomic data analysis and storage is crucial. Public Perception and Trust: Building public trust in the security and ethical use of genomic data on blockchain is essential. Addressing concerns about data misuse and ensuring transparency will be key to widespread adoption. Financial Viability: Acquiring and restructuring 23andMe, while investing in blockchain infrastructure, is a significant financial undertaking. The Sei Foundation needs to demonstrate a clear path to financial sustainability and return on investment. Is This a Gamble Worth Taking? The Sei Foundation itself acknowledges that acquiring 23andMe is a “gamble.” It’s a high-stakes bet on the future of decentralized science (DeSci) and the transformative potential of combining blockchain with genomics data . The potential rewards are immense – a future where individuals control their genetic information, scientific discovery accelerates, and personalized medicine becomes a reality. However, the risks are equally significant. Successfully navigating the technical, regulatory, ethical, and financial challenges is a monumental task. The security of data security is not just a technical issue; it’s a matter of national security, as the Sei Foundation rightly points out. The implications of mishandling such sensitive information are profound. Ultimately, the Sei Foundation’s audacious move could be a pivotal moment for both the blockchain and biotech industries. It’s a bold step towards realizing the promise of DeSci and empowering individuals in the age of genomic information. Whether this gamble pays off remains to be seen, but the very consideration of such an acquisition signals a paradigm shift in how we think about data ownership and the future of scientific research. This potential acquisition is more than just a business deal; it’s a statement about the future of data, science, and individual empowerment. It’s a development that crypto enthusiasts, scientists, and anyone concerned about data privacy should be watching closely.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 466,000 followers on the social media platform X that Curve DAO ( CRV ) may increase more than 240% from its current value if it can break through a key resistance area. “For those looking to buy a dip on CRV, on lower timeframes, we are approaching a key level of resistance on both USD and BTC pairings. Identify this level (it’s easy enough to do on the four-hour chart) and understand that this region is the most likely place for this rally to the upside to end if the bottom isn’t already in. If we clear this region, it’s clear skies to $2+. As we push into this resistance zone, you want to be watching for a potential rejection.” The trader says CRV needs to reclaim $0.67 in its USD pair (CRV/USD) to rally toward new local highs, while its key resistance level to break through against Bitcoin (CRV/ BTC ) is 0.00000633 BTC ($0.55). “These are the aforementioned levels of interest on low timeframe for CRV. A clean re-claim of the red zone and we should quickly accelerate to new local highs. Lots of untapped local highs above us that are a draw to the upside. We just need to clear local resistance and have some favorable developments on BTC (aka avoid a BTC nuke back down to low $80,000s). We successfully clear this zone and that is our confirmation that the bottom is in.” Source: Credible Crypto/X CRV is trading for $0.58 at time of writing, up 10.2% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, he warns that payments token XRP may be on the verge of a correction. “I am calling for a drop on XRP and a pump on ETH and CRV. Not everything must move in the same direction at all times.” XRP is trading for $2.33 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours.

This comes as a fresh relief rally after Pi Coin faced a steep 20% drop over the past week. Moreover, it seems that investors are looking beyond PI token unlocks along with slowing down exchange deposits. Why Is Pi Network Coin Price Up Today? As stated, the Pi Coin deposits to exchanges have dropped significantly, hinting at a potential shift in market activity. Over the past 24 hours, only 1 million PI tokens were deposited across exchanges, against the tens of millions of deposits in the previous week, PiScan data showed. The most significant transaction during this period was a transfer between exchanges, with tokens moving from Bitget to Gate.io. This drop in deposits can lead to upward price pressure for the Pi Network Coin. As shown in the image below, the total PI balance on centralized exchanges is upwards of 352 million, with OKX exchange alone having 160 million in PI balance and Bitget exchange having over 81 million in PI balance. Source: Moon Jeff Over the past month, the Pi Coin price has crashed all the way from the peak of $3 to now $0.82, eroding more than 75% of investors’ wealth. However, market analysts are still hopeful of its recovery to $3 if three main factors align. Mainnet Progress: The launch of a fully open Pi Mainnet could significantly boost demand for PI tokens. Exchange Listings: Expanded listings across major exchanges would enhance accessibility and liquidity. After much discussion in social media and despite high expectations, crypto exchange Binance has excluded Pi Network from its listing plan. Ecosystem Growth: The development of real-world use cases and strategic partnerships could further drive adoption and utility. Eyeing Complete Decentralization Pi Network could be eyeing complete decentralization while embracing crypto and Web3. This has been the latest buzz in the town, keeping investors curious. π △ — diange (@Pi_diange) March 28, 2025 It appears to be hinting at a significant partnership that could reshape the crypto or financial landscape. The cryptic message above has sparked speculation about a collaboration between Pi and Web3 (symbolized by the triangle), potentially signaling a step toward a fully decentralized future. As of press time, the Pi Coin price is trading at $0.831 with a market cap of $5.62 billion. With the current bounce back, the altcoin has broken out of the trendline formation over the past 14 days. If the PI price stays above $0.8340, it could stage a quick recovery to $1.

US President Trump is the largest shareholder of SAVVY MINING, with a shareholding value of about US$3 billion. SAVVY MINING is also the first choice for cloud mining in the world. SAVVY MINING issued a statement on Tuesday (March 25) that it will sell cloud mining products and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to other US financial products on the Trump Company platform. Once approved by regulators, these products will be listed in the United States, Europe and Asia this year. SAVVY MINING will provide the latest cloud mining services and technical support to create future wealth with everyone. It is worth mentioning that SAVVY MINING has been in court with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In October last year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission publicly stated that it planned to sue SAVVY MINING for “unregistered”. The latter also fought back with a lawsuit, saying that the regulator exceeded their authority. However, SAVVY MINING withdrew the lawsuit in December last year after Trump won the presidential election. At that time, a SAVVY MINING spokesperson also said: We look forward to working with the new government to jointly develop and promote a clear regulatory framework for the cloud mining industry. Mr. Paul Holmes, CEO of SAVVY MINING, also met with Trump in the United States to discuss political appointments related to the cloud mining industry.

Ripple’s technology is being explored but remains separate from these financial systems. While some reports claim FedNow integrates XRP for faster payments, no confirmed connection between the two. Claims persist within the crypto community that Ripple’s XRP is deeply integrated into major financial systems like the US Federal Reserve’s FedNow service, the SWIFT global banking network, and emerging Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). These narratives often shoot at XRP set for dominance, with also the positive news around latest regulatory developments and XRP ETF approval. However, a closer examination reveals Ripple’s specific technologies and the XRP asset generally remain distinct from these established or developing infrastructures. FedNow and XRP: Setting the Record Straight The Federal Reserve launched the FedNow instant payment service on July 20, 2023 , as an instant payment service for U.S. banks and credit unions to settle transactions in real-time, which eliminates traditional delays.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-sooner-or-later-people-will-fully-accept-xrp-is-the-one-heres-why/,"Dark Defender (@DefendDark), a well-known crypto analyst, recently reiterated his belief that XRP can become the leading digital asset in the cryptocurrency market. In a post on X, he emphasized its unique regulatory position, institutional adoption, and potential to integrate with major financial systems. “Sooner or later, people will fully accept that XRP is the ‘One,'” he stated, pointing to recent developments that strengthen his argument that XRP can dominate the crypto space. Sooner or later, People will fully accept that $XRP is the ""One"". Only coin with regulatory clarity Strategic crypto asset reserve for the US ETF approvals are imminent FedNow, SWIFT, IMF, EU, CBDCs are incoming. It was not BTC; it has never been ETH. — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) March 27, 2025 Regulatory Clarity and ETFs Unlike most cryptocurrencies, XRP benefits from regulatory clarity that sets it apart. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, which lasted for years, concluded with the agency dropping its appeal. Instead of the initial $125 million penalty, Ripple will pay only $50 million to settle the case. This outcome reinforces XRP’s legal standing and removes a major source of uncertainty for investors. Furthermore, multiple filings for an XRP ETF have been acknowledged by the SEC, as 11 applications are currently pending. If approved, an XRP ETF would mark a significant milestone, increasing institutional adoption and strengthening its role in the financial sector. Institutional Use and Global Integration XRP’s utility extends beyond regulatory clarity. Ripple has positioned itself as a key asset for financial institutions, facilitating efficient cross-border transactions. The asset has long been recognized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its ability to revolutionize cross-border payments, and it is gaining traction in Europe, where Ripple is expanding its operations. XRP’s potential to integrate with SWIFT, the dominant global payment network, is another factor contributing to its growing relevance. Many experts believe XRP could either replace SWIFT or integrate with it to enhance international settlements, offering a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Stablecoins and the Future of Payments Ripple is also making significant strides in the stablecoin sector. While Dark Defender initially drew attention to CBDCs, Donald Trump’s refusal to pursue CBDC projects may have put those plans on hold for the XRP community. The analyst highlighted Ripple’s progress with stablecoins as another important factor. The launch of RLUSD in December 2024, along with plans for other stablecoins in other currencies, showcases Ripple’s commitment to digital payments and financial innovation. These stablecoins further position XRP at the center of global finance, reinforcing its utility and adoption. Additionally, XRP is aligned with FedNow , the U.S. Federal Reserve’s instant payment system, which could accelerate its use in domestic and international transactions. XRP continues to solidify its position as a leading digital asset, and as Dark Defender stated, “It was not BTC; it has never been ETH,” suggesting XRP is on its way to the top.

42522025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144150,1743153658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Dramatic US Government ETH Transfer: $1.77M Seized in Sae-Heng Case Unveiled,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-government-eth-transfer/,"In a fascinating turn of events in the crypto world, the U.S. government has made a significant move involving a substantial amount of seized Ethereum (ETH). Are you curious about what this dramatic US government crypto transaction entails and why it matters? Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing story. What’s Happening with the Seized Ethereum? Data from Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics platform, reveals that a wallet identified as belonging to the U.S. government has transferred a considerable sum of 884.33 ETH. This amount, valued at approximately $1.77 million, was sent to an external cryptocurrency address starting with 0xBf7. But where did this seized Ethereum come from, and what’s the story behind it? According to reports, these funds are directly linked to assets seized in connection with the Sae-Heng case. The Sae-Heng case, while not explicitly detailed in the provided content, likely refers to a legal or criminal investigation where assets, including cryptocurrencies like ETH, were confiscated by the U.S. government. The movement of these funds now raises several questions: Why is the US government moving this ETH now? Is it a routine procedure, or does it signal something more significant? Where is the ETH going? The transfer to an external address suggests it’s not simply moving between government-controlled wallets. What does this mean for the future of seized crypto assets? Does this set a precedent for how the U.S. government handles digital assets in legal cases? Decoding the ETH Transfer: Sae-Heng Case Context To understand the significance of this ETH transfer , it’s crucial to consider the Sae-Heng case. While specific details about the case aren’t provided, we can infer that it likely involves illicit activities where cryptocurrency was used, leading to asset seizure by law enforcement. Such cases are becoming increasingly common as cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the global financial system – and sometimes, unfortunately, into illegal operations. Here’s what we can deduce about the Sae-Heng case and its relation to this crypto movement: Aspect Possible Implication Asset Seizure The U.S. government likely seized the 884.33 ETH as part of legal proceedings against individuals or entities involved in the Sae-Heng case. External Wallet Transfer (0xBf7…) This could indicate several possibilities: Sale of Assets: The government might be preparing to sell the seized ETH. Transferring to an external wallet could be a step towards moving it to an exchange. Custodial Transfer: It could be a transfer to a different custodian or platform for management or storage. Return of Assets: In less likely scenarios, it could be related to a legal outcome where assets are being returned, though this is less probable given the ‘seized’ context. Arkham Intelligence Tracking The fact that blockchain analytics firms like Arkham are tracking these movements highlights the transparency of blockchain technology. Every transaction is recorded and publicly viewable, allowing for scrutiny of government actions in the crypto space. Why is this Crypto Seizure News Important? The movement of crypto seizure assets by governments is a topic of considerable interest within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. It touches upon several key areas: Government Regulation and Oversight: It showcases the increasing involvement of governments in the cryptocurrency space, not just in terms of regulation but also in asset control and management. Transparency and Blockchain Analytics: The ability to track these transactions underscores the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. Tools like Arkham Intelligence empower the public to monitor government activities in the digital asset realm. Market Impact: Large movements of ETH, especially from government wallets, can sometimes influence market sentiment, although in this case, $1.77 million is unlikely to have a major price impact on ETH. However, larger, more frequent sales could potentially exert downward pressure. Legal and Procedural Frameworks: These events highlight the developing legal frameworks around cryptocurrency seizures and forfeitures. How governments handle seized crypto assets is still evolving, and each case provides more insight into these processes. Actionable Insights and Future Implications What can we learn from this US government crypto activity, and what might it mean for the future? Increased Government Activity in Crypto: Expect to see more government agencies worldwide becoming involved in cryptocurrency, both in regulatory and operational capacities. This includes seizing, managing, and potentially selling digital assets. Importance of Blockchain Analytics: Tools for tracking and analyzing blockchain transactions will become even more critical for transparency and accountability, especially concerning government and large institutional movements of crypto. Evolving Legal Landscape: The legal and procedural frameworks surrounding digital asset seizures and forfeitures will continue to develop and become more refined as governments gain more experience in this area. Potential Market Liquidity: Governments holding and periodically selling seized crypto could become a factor in market liquidity, although the impact will depend on the scale and frequency of these sales. In Conclusion: A Glimpse into Government Crypto Operations The U.S. government’s movement of $1.77 million in seized ETH, linked to the Sae-Heng case, provides a fascinating glimpse into the intersection of cryptocurrency, law enforcement, and government operations. It underscores the growing importance of digital assets in legal and financial landscapes and highlights the transparency afforded by blockchain technology. As governments continue to grapple with the implications of cryptocurrencies, events like these will become increasingly common, shaping the future of digital asset regulation and management.

Peter Brandt quoted a post by an analyst with the nickname HTL-NL via the X account. The analyst, HTL-NL, pointed to an impending correction for BTC by applying the Wyckoff Method, which helps identify market cycles through supply and demand. Based on this analysis, the analyst shared a chart showing BTC’s possible collapse to $76,700 or even around $70,000. Citing this chart and analysis, Peter Brandt noted that this estimate seems reasonable. This is not an unreasonable expectation https://t.co/8LRVBjBv2A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) March 28, 2025 According to Brandt, while a bearish prediction for Bitcoin would not be an unreasonable expectation considering the current market conditions, Brandt had recently said in an analysis that the Bitcoin chart was in a downward trend following the formation of the double top pattern. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s What Analyst Says,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-new-ath-by-q2-despite-volatile-macroeconomics-heres-what-analyst-says/,"Bitcoin recent dip below the $100,000 mark may have rattled some investors, but market experts remain optimistic. According to Jamie Coutts, Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst, Bitcoin is on track to break past its all-time high of $109,000 sooner than anticipated. Coutts believes the flagship cryptocurrency could hit new records before the end of Q2 2025, regardless of the current US economic uncertainties. In a recent interview , Coutts highlighted that Trump’s new tariffs and concerns over a potential recession have weighed on BTC price. However, he argues that the market is underestimating the impact of improving financial conditions. The recent easing of liquidity by the People’s Bank of China and the sharp drop in US Treasury bond volatility are setting the stage for a rapid Bitcoin recovery, according to the analyst. Liquidity Easing Fuels Bullish Predictions Coutts pointed to dramatically eased financial conditions in recent weeks as a bullish signal for Bitcoin. He noted that the US Dollar Index (DXY) recently experienced its third-largest three-day drop since 2015, suggesting a weakening dollar that could benefit BTC. Referencing a March 7 post on X, Coutts shared that, based on historical DXY patterns, Bitcoin’s price could range from $102,000 (worst-case) to $123,000 (best-case) by June 1, 2025. The latter would mark a 13% surge above its current all-time high, reached on January 20. Despite the bullish outlook, Bitcoin is currently facing weak market sentiment. As per CryptoQuant, the Bull Score Index sits at 20, its lowest level since January 2023, indicating lackluster market momentum. Historically, when the index remains below 40 for an extended period, it signals prolonged bearish phases. Bitcoin Resilience in Recessionary Conditions Interestingly, even if the US economy slides into a recession, Bitcoin could still thrive. BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick , recently stated that a recession would likely act as a catalyst for BTC, as investors seek alternative stores of value. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $85,680, marking a 1.3% drop over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. However, with liquidity improving and macroeconomic pressures potentially fueling demand, analysts remain confident that Bitcoin’s next all-time high could arrive faster than expected.

Currently at $0.025, the token is inched to a 20% breakthrough in Phase 5 — which will exceed $0.03. Those able to secure MUTM from the start now have the potential to bask in a 140% gain on the $0.06 exchange listing, a figure itself hardwired into its tokenomics. Analysts expect even sharper increases after its launch, with expectations as high as $3.50 by late 2025. This momentum beats beyond high-yield prospects with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) even threatening established players like Chainlink (LINK), which recently broke out of a bearish channel but is now met with skepticism over the sustainability of its rally. Chainlink (LINK) rose 2.25% to $15.40, broke a descending channel. If it remains above $15.15, a 25% up shoot to $19.30 is anticipated according to technical indicators. But trading volume has fallen 20%, suggesting flimsy market engagement. Building Demand for Mutuum Finance’s Presale The fourth phase of the presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is filling up fast as early investors look to buy for just $0.025 before the price jump. This has already caused three phases to sell out. While the project’s tokenomics ensure a 140% return at launch, post-listing targets are much higher: conservative estimates have MUTM near $1.80 in the coming months, while more bullish scenarios eye $3.50. This path comes from Mutuum Finance’s double engine of growth strategy. MUTM has, first, its lending protocol which creates consistent demand through mtTokens — interest-bearing deposit certificates that are transferable between DeFi protocols. Second, 15% of platform fees are continuously used to purchase MUTM from open markets, redistributing tokens to stakers and alleviating sell-side pressure. Certik smart contract audits are in progress and will be completed before going onto the exchange. Once finalized, the audit results will be released via Mutuum Finance’s social channels, further bolstering investor confidence in its security architecture. Whereas hype cycle projects rely on big narratives to drive speculation, MUTM has structural value proposition: each loan issued and mtToken minted diverges away from the total supply, increasing token scarcity on a fundamental level. A Token Designed to Soar in the Long Run Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — An innovative protocol providing users with liquidity access without liquidation of assets. Loans are overcollateralized by borrowers which helps stabilize the ecosystem, and lenders earn a dynamic yield tied to the utilization of the pool. This balance draws in both conservative players and yield optimizers, forming a perpetual motion machine. The speed of the presale — $5.7 million in just weeks — suggests institutional-grade interest not often seen in early-stage projects. After launch, the buy-and-distribute model will tighten supply even further, sending the token upwards of speculative competitors. Chainlink (LINK) may experience brief escapes from bearish tapes, but factors like dependency on external partnerships and volatile developer activity render it exposed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, has growth built right into the protocol itself, unifying DeFi innovation with unrelenting demand for the token. With subsequent phases of the presale passing, the question isn’t if MUTM is hitting 30x growth, but how quickly it will surpass outdated legacy tokens fading into obsolescence. Position Up Before New Highs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are rewriting the defy playbook by combining utility and investor rewards. Pending approval of the Certik audit, adds even more credibility, and the tiered structure of the presale also ensures that early backers get maximum gains. As a result, Procrastination may mean you miss your last chance to end the sub-$0.03 pricing. Head to Mutuum Finance’s official site and get in the game before the next pump — and set up for a post-launch world in which MUTM doesn’t just compete, it dominates.

Tether’s Crosschain Stablecoin USDT0 Expands to Optimism’s Superchain, Boosting Ethereum L2 Adoption Tether’s crosschain US-dollar stablecoin, USDT0, has been deployed to Optimism’s Superchain, a move poised to significantly increase access to the world’s most widely used stable asset across Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem. The deployment was officially announced by Optimism on March 27, marking a pivotal step in enhancing liquidity, DeFi participation, and crosschain interoperability for USDT0 holders. USDT0 is a bridged, crosschain version of Tether’s flagship USDt stablecoin, specifically engineered to extend the stablecoin’s dominance beyond Ethereum’s mainnet to a broader range of Layer-2 (L2) and DeFi-focused blockchains. The asset made its debut in January 2025 on Ink Network, a Layer-2 protocol developed by crypto exchange giant Kraken, before making its way to the Superchain. Optimism’s Superchain is an interconnected network of Ethereum Layer-2 chains built using Optimism’s OP Stack technology. It aims to address Ethereum’s scalability challenges by offering faster, cheaper, and interoperable blockspace. According to Superchain Health Dashboard data, the Superchain currently accounts for 52% of all Ethereum Layer-2 transactions, up from 36.6% in September 2024 — a sharp rise that reflects the growing confidence and utility of the network. The inclusion of USDT0 is expected to further accelerate this growth, adding liquidity and seamless dollar-denominated trading to Optimism’s ecosystem. The arrival of USDT0 on Superchain is more than just another stablecoin deployment; it is a strategic play in the broader Layer-2 adoption war. Ryan Wyatt, Optimism’s Chief Growth Officer, previously stated that he expects Superchain to account for 80% of Ethereum L2 transactions by the end of 2025. At the time of his statement in February, the Superchain ecosystem had locked in $4 billion in total value — a number that has since grown to $4.2 billion. Stablecoins like USDT0 are often seen as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based payments, serving as the bridge between traditional finance and crypto-native ecosystems. Optimism noted that this deployment is expected to attract “more top-tier assets, applications, and partners” to its network, solidifying the Superchain’s position as a leading hub for DeFi innovation. The timing of USDT0’s Superchain launch coincides with a broader surge in stablecoin adoption across the crypto landscape. According to data from RWA.xyz, the total value of stablecoins in circulation has ballooned to nearly $228 billion, marking a 3.3% increase over the past month. Stablecoins now boast a global user base of over 155 million holders, with Ethereum accounting for a dominant 58% share of the total stablecoin supply. Tether’s USDt remains the undisputed market leader in the stablecoin sector, benefiting from its first-mover advantage and robust treasury reserves. In recent years, Tether has quietly become one of the largest holders of US Treasury securities, helping it generate record-breaking profits and cementing its dominance as the most trusted stable asset in the crypto economy. The USDT0 deployment also comes at a time when stablecoins are increasingly at the center of US digital asset policy discussions. The return of Donald Trump to the US presidency has reignited efforts to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Recently, Bo Hines, the head of Trump’s Council on Digital Assets, revealed at a New York fintech conference that a stablecoin regulation bill could land on the president’s desk within the next two months. The legislation, if passed, is expected to provide clear legal parameters for stablecoins like USDt and USDT0, possibly accelerating institutional adoption and further integrating them into the US financial system. The Future of USDT0 and Crosschain DeFi USDT0’s expansion to Optimism’s Superchain signals a broader trend toward a multi-chain stablecoin economy, where users can access liquidity and dollar stability without being constrained by Ethereum’s mainnet fees or congestion. The move signals the increasingly interoperable, scalable, and user-friendly future of decentralized finance, where stable assets like USDT0 can seamlessly power transactions, lending, trading, and yield-generating opportunities across diverse blockchain networks. As the Superchain continues to solidify its position as Ethereum’s leading Layer-2 collective, and with stablecoin adoption showing no signs of slowing, Tether’s USDT0 may well become the cornerstone asset that bridges traditional financial value to the rapidly evolving decentralized economy. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino Declares Start of 'Stablecoin Multiverse' as Industry Enters New Growth Phase In related news, the stablecoin sector is entering a new phase of rapid expansion, according to Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. In a recent social media post, Ardoino described the current market as the beginning of the ”Stablecoin Multiverse” era, signaling a shift toward increased diversification and widespread adoption of stablecoins by both private companies and sovereign governments. In an X thread published on March 27, Ardoino emphasized that global demand for stable digital currencies is surging, and the industry is responding with a proliferation of new stablecoin solutions. The Tether CEO’s comments arrive at a time when both governments and corporations around the world are exploring or actively developing their own fiat-pegged digital currencies. Ardoino believes this trend marks the start of a new chapter for the cryptocurrency industry, one where stablecoins become the primary tool for cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and crypto-native transactions. Tether itself has been at the forefront of this movement. Its flagship product, USDt, is the world’s most widely used stablecoin, with a current market capitalization of over $100 billion and more than 400 million users globally, according to Ardoino. He also expressed confidence that this user base could soon surpass one billion, as demand accelerates in underbanked regions and emerging markets. While Ardoino’s declaration of a new stablecoin era has generated significant buzz, not everyone in the crypto space agrees with his assessment. Slava Demchuk, CEO of crypto compliance firm AMLBot, said that Ardoino’s comments exaggerate the current state of the market. Demchuk pointed out that launching a compliant, regulated stablecoin is far more difficult than it may appear. He argued that while stablecoin innovation is growing, the idea of a ”multiverse” crowded with hundreds of new stablecoins is not yet reality. Demchuk also warned that regulatory fragmentation is creating uncertainty in the sector. While MiCA provides clear guidelines in the European Union, the United States is still struggling to implement comprehensive stablecoin regulations. This regulatory patchwork could drive some stablecoin issuers to operate in less regulated jurisdictions, potentially undermining consumer protections and increasing risks related to illicit finance. Challenges in Europe and the US Tether’s USDt has recently faced challenges in major markets. In particular, several major crypto exchanges — including Binance, Crypto.com, Kraken, and Coinbase — delisted USDt for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) in response to MiCA compliance requirements. Vasily Vidmanov, Chief Operating Officer of decentralized finance compliance protocol PureFi, said that Ardoino’s projection of one billion users is ”interesting but not entirely realistic” in the current environment. He pointed to Tether's delisting in Europe as a major obstacle. Data tracked by Dune Analytics also reveals an increase in USDT-to-USDC swaps following the delisting, suggesting that users in Europe are shifting toward Circle’s USDC, which has taken a more regulatory-friendly approach in global markets. Adding to Tether’s challenges are ongoing investigations in the US related to compliance with sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. US authorities have reportedly been probing the use of Tether’s stablecoins in illicit activities through third-party platforms. While Ardoino previously dismissed these reports as ”old noise,” reputational risks remain a concern for the firm.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,USDT|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 09:30:00
42522318,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144204,1743154203,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Regulation: EU Authority Demands 100% Capital for Insurance Crypto Holdings,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eu-crypto-capital-requirements/,"Is the era of freewheeling crypto investments for insurance companies drawing to a close in Europe? The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) has dropped a bombshell proposal that could fundamentally reshape how insurance firms handle crypto assets. They’re suggesting a staggering 100% capital requirement for insurance firms venturing into crypto holdings. What does this mean for policyholders, insurance companies, and the broader crypto landscape? Let’s dive deep into this crucial development. Understanding the Proposed Crypto Capital Requirements Imagine you’re an insurance company in the EU, and you’ve decided to dip your toes into the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. According to EIOPA’s new proposal, for every euro’s worth of Bitcoin or Ethereum you hold, you’d need to set aside another euro in reserve capital. Yes, you read that right – a full 100% capital requirement! This isn’t a minor adjustment; it’s a seismic shift in how regulators are approaching insurance crypto holdings . But why such a drastic measure? EIOPA isn’t pulling this number out of thin air. They cite the inherent volatility and risk associated with crypto assets. In their official statement, EIOPA emphasized that: “Crypto-assets are currently considered to be highly volatile, speculative and not yet subject to adequate investor protection in the Union, and pose risks for financial stability.” This statement underscores the core concern: protecting policyholders. Insurance companies manage funds that are crucial for people’s financial security, covering everything from health emergencies to retirement plans. If these funds are exposed to the wild swings of the crypto market without sufficient safeguards, the potential fallout could be significant. Hence, the crypto capital requirements are designed as a robust buffer against potential losses. Why 100%? Is it Really Necessary? The question on everyone’s mind is likely: why 100%? Isn’t that excessive? To understand EIOPA’s rationale, let’s break down the key factors at play: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their price swings. Bitcoin, for instance, can experience double-digit percentage drops in a single day. This volatility makes it difficult for insurance companies to reliably value and manage these assets within their traditional risk frameworks. Market Immaturity: The crypto market is still relatively young and unregulated compared to traditional financial markets. This immaturity translates to higher risks related to market manipulation, fraud, and lack of established oversight. Investor Protection Concerns: EIOPA’s primary mandate is to protect policyholders. A 100% capital charge is seen as a precautionary measure to ensure that insurance companies can meet their obligations to policyholders even if their crypto investments plummet in value. Prudence and Precaution: Regulatory bodies often err on the side of caution when dealing with new and potentially disruptive asset classes. The 100% requirement reflects a highly prudent approach, especially in the initial stages of regulating insurance crypto involvement. The Potential Impact of EIOPA’s Crypto Rules What are the ripple effects of these proposed EIOPA crypto rules ? Let’s consider the potential consequences for various stakeholders: Insurance Companies: Reduced Crypto Investment: A 100% capital requirement makes holding crypto assets significantly less attractive for insurance firms. It essentially doubles the cost of investing in crypto, potentially deterring many from entering or expanding their crypto portfolios. Focus on Lower-Risk Assets: Insurance companies may pivot back to more traditional, lower-risk asset classes to avoid the hefty capital burden associated with crypto. Competitive Disadvantage (Potentially): Insurers in regions with less stringent crypto regulations might gain a competitive edge if they can tap into crypto’s potential returns without such high capital costs. However, this is balanced against the increased risk. Policyholders: Increased Security: The primary benefit for policyholders is enhanced security. The 100% capital requirement acts as a strong safety net, minimizing the risk that insurance companies will be unable to pay out claims due to crypto-related losses. Potentially Slower Innovation (Indirectly): While security is paramount, overly strict regulations could stifle innovation within the insurance sector, potentially leading to slower adoption of new technologies and investment strategies in the long run. Crypto Market: Reduced Institutional Investment from EU Insurers: The proposal could lead to a decrease in institutional investment from EU insurance companies into the crypto market, potentially dampening demand and market liquidity, especially in the short term. Precedent for Global Regulations: EIOPA’s stance could set a precedent for other regulatory bodies worldwide. If the EU adopts such a stringent approach, other regions might follow suit, leading to a more globally coordinated regulatory framework for crypto in the insurance sector. Focus on Risk Management: The regulation underscores the importance of robust risk management in the crypto space. It may push crypto firms and exchanges to adopt stricter compliance measures and risk mitigation strategies to appeal to institutional investors operating under such regulatory scrutiny. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of EU Crypto Regulation EIOPA’s proposal is a significant step in the ongoing development of EU crypto regulation . It reflects a broader trend among global regulators to grapple with the risks and opportunities presented by digital assets. While the 100% capital requirement might seem extreme, it’s crucial to view it within the context of: Protecting Financial Stability: Regulators are tasked with maintaining the stability of the financial system. Given crypto’s volatility and interconnectedness with traditional finance, cautious regulation is seen as necessary to prevent systemic risks. Balancing Innovation and Risk: The regulatory challenge lies in striking a balance between fostering innovation in the digital asset space and mitigating potential risks to consumers and the financial system. EIOPA’s proposal leans heavily towards risk mitigation at this stage. Global Regulatory Coordination: As crypto is a global phenomenon, international cooperation and coordination among regulators are essential. EIOPA’s approach contributes to the ongoing global dialogue on crypto regulation. For insurance firms, the message is clear: crypto investments will be under intense regulatory scrutiny in the EU. Those considering venturing into this space will need to carefully weigh the potential benefits against the significantly increased capital costs and compliance burdens. Robust risk management frameworks and a deep understanding of the evolving regulatory landscape will be paramount for navigating this new era of crypto risk mitigation . Actionable Insights for Stakeholders So, what should insurance companies, policyholders, and crypto market participants take away from this development? For Insurance Companies: Reassess Crypto Strategies: Evaluate the viability of crypto investments under a 100% capital requirement. Consider whether the potential returns justify the increased capital burden. Focus on Compliance: Prioritize building robust compliance frameworks to meet evolving regulatory expectations for digital assets. Engage with Regulators: Actively participate in industry consultations and dialogues with EIOPA and other regulatory bodies to shape future crypto regulations. For Policyholders: Increased Confidence: Take comfort in the fact that regulators are prioritizing the safety and security of your insurance funds. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in crypto regulation and how they might indirectly affect the insurance sector. For Crypto Market Participants: Expect Increased Regulation: Recognize that stricter regulation of crypto assets is becoming increasingly likely, especially in institutional contexts. Focus on Institutional Compliance: Crypto firms seeking institutional investment should prioritize building compliance infrastructure and risk management capabilities to meet the demands of regulated investors. Global Perspective: Monitor regulatory developments globally, as EIOPA’s proposal could signal a broader trend towards stricter crypto oversight. Conclusion: A Bold Move or Overly Cautious? EIOPA’s proposal for a 100% capital requirement on insurance firms’ crypto holdings is undoubtedly a bold move. Whether it’s overly cautious or a necessary step to protect policyholders and financial stability remains to be seen. However, it undeniably signals a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for crypto assets in the EU and potentially beyond. As the crypto market matures and regulators worldwide grapple with its complexities, we can expect continued evolution and refinement of rules governing the intersection of crypto and traditional finance. One thing is certain: the era of unregulated crypto exposure for institutional investors is rapidly fading, replaced by a new paradigm of heightened scrutiny and stringent capital safeguards.

With 2025 seeing wild market volatility, investors are watchfully eyeing Cardano, Remittix, Sui, and Shiba Inu for their potential to bring in phenomenal returns. However, hype-chasing is not sufficient to navigate the crypto universe. While meme coins and spec-project tokens oscillate wildly, tokens that solve real-world issues are finding their ground more and more. Among this bunch of rivals, Remittix is particularly drawing the attention of investors, especially those seeking secure, fast, and affordable cross-border payments. Cardano (ADA): Rising, but Facing Resistance Cardano has made positive headlines recently, gaining more than 4% this week alone. Its stablecoin market cap reaching an all-time high of $30.77 million suggests increasing DeFi activity, fueling investor optimism. Traders’ bullish bets on ADA are also peaking, reflecting rising confidence. However, ADA is currently wrestling against strong resistance near $0.77. Even if it surpasses this level, a significant rally remains uncertain given ADA’s recent volatility. Dormant wallet activity has spiked lately, suggesting whales might sell soon, potentially dragging ADA back down. While Cardano holds promise, the likelihood of achieving a 100x return by 2025 remains slim. Investors seeking more reliable gains might look elsewhere, particularly toward tokens offering immediate practical uses, like Remittix. Source: Tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Power, But Volatility Remains High Shiba Inu continues to ride a strong meme-fueled rally, recently surging 16% in just one week. Expanding volumes of trade and the positive market disposition have helped SHIB overcome its meme reputation, especially with the likes of Shibarium fueling adoption. But SHIB’s biggest hurdle remains its intense volatility. Technicals can be bullish for now, but SHIB is highly reliant on speculative traders. This reliance on whimsical meme hype guarantees that deep price plunges are always on the cards. Doubling $100 to $10,000 would require SHIB growing exponentially—something that would need sustained, mass adoption. Probable but not without investors risking a gigantic amount. Source: Tradingview Sui: Rebounding from Deep Losses but Still Risky Despite recent optimism, Sui priced at $2.74 remains down nearly 60% from its earlier highs this year. Canary Capital ETF updates and recent news like the SUI Overflow Hackathon have re-ignited short-term interest, temporarily stabilizing the SUI price. Technically, the short term for SUI is optimistically cautious. Nevertheless, long term resistance at approximately $3.20 is a formidable barrier. Its comeback in the market hinges on speculative conditions, hence Sui’s general outlook is questionable. With its wild history and speculative gains, a 100x bet on Sui by 2025 is too optimistic. Those that need something more stable and seemingly pragmatic are better off with utilitarian solutions like Remittix. Source: Tradingview Remittix: Payments Utility Drives Potential Massive Gains Competing head-to-head with Shiba Inu, Cardano, and Sui volatility, Remittix is gaining investor momentum at a very fast pace with real-world payment solutions. Facilitating global crypto-to-fiat payments, Remittix is offering real-world, real-world applications—a central use case driving its meteoric growth. Remittix’s solution simplifies cross-border financial transactions, making life much simpler for people and businesses. Think of a worldwide charity that receives crypto donations; Remittix enables real-time conversion into local currencies without banking delays or outrageous fees. With more than 522 million tokens sold and more than $14.1 million raised, Remittix continues to surpass speculative cryptos by meeting an actual market need. Remittix has been compared by analysts to the potential of XRP and XLM in their infancy, both of which exploded in value due to their payment utilities. With Remittix’s real-world value and exemplary investor backing, it has far more potential to yield massive returns than its counterparts. Why Remittix Stands Out for 2025 Investors While Cardano’s DeFi expansion, Shiba Inu’s meme-driven growth, and Sui’s speculative rebound offer intrigue, none provide Remittix’s blend of stability and clear use-case utility. Crypto investments in 2025 favor projects solving real-world problems, especially payments-related tokens, as seen with XRP and XLM. By streamlining global crypto payments, Remittix addresses widespread financial challenges. Its rapid adoption and growing investor interest make it the top candidate for achieving massive gains in 2025. Investors seeking to potentially turn $100 into $10,000 should closely examine Remittix as their best option. Ready to explore the token poised to reshape global payments?

Legal Issues Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. SEC has officially dropped its appeal in the ongoing legal case with Ripple, bringing an end to a four-year legal battle. However, the SEC has yet to confirm the latest developments. There’s been a lot of talk about what will happen to XRP once the SEC clears the legal issues.. Some experts think that when the SEC removes the injunction, Ripple will be able to sell XRP to institutional investors without any problems. However, Marc Fagel, a former SEC lawyer, explained why that’s not exactly true. What Fagel Says About XRP Sales Fagel pointed out that even if the SEC clears the injunction, the court’s original ruling still stands. The court had previously ruled that Ripple’s sales of XRP to institutional investors were against the law. This means that selling XRP in the same way as before would still be illegal, regardless of the injunction. He explained that the issue is not just about specific contracts or agreements, but about how Ripple sold XRP to institutional investors. The court found that the way these sales were made made XRP an unregistered security, meaning any future sales made in a similar way could still be illegal. Room for Legal Flexibility Despite the legal concerns, Fagel mentioned that not all sales to institutional investors would require registration. Some sales might be allowed under special exemptions. It all depends on the details of the transactions and whether they are similar to the ones that were previously found illegal. However, Fagel also pointed out that the SEC has been less focused on regulating the crypto market recently. This means that Ripple might not face strict consequences for its future sales of XRP, even if they are similar to previous ones. What’s Next for Ripple and XRP? As for Ripple, Fagel said the company’s legal team will need to carefully consider any future sales. If they follow the same pattern as the past sales, they could face legal issues. But since the SEC is less involved in crypto regulation now, Ripple may be able to move forward with fewer legal concerns. Will Judge Torres Clarify the Ruling? Some people asked if Judge Torres would provide more clarity on the past XRP sales to institutional investors. Fagel believes she probably won’t. The judge has already made her decision, and Ripple is likely to request that she remove the injunction entirely. The attorney thinks there’s little chance that the judge will change her ruling, as she was previously reluctant to make it more specific.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 09:32:30

Binance denied any system breach, and attributed the leak to phishing attacks. Some of the other major security incidents that happened over the past few days include the US Department of Justice seizing over $200,000 in crypto tied to Hamas' fundraising efforts. Meanwhile, the DeFi ecosystem faced yet another blow after a crypto whale exploited the meme coin Jelly my Jelly (JELLY) on Hyperliquid. The exploit ended up profiting more than $6 million and exposed some serious vulnerabilities in decentralized platforms. Gemini and Binance User Records Allegedly Leaked Dark web threat actors are reportedly selling sensitive user data that belongs to Gemini and Binance customers. According to cyber news outlet Dark Web Informer , a threat actor operating under the alias AKM69 put up for sale a database that allegedly contains 100,000 records of Gemini users. The leaked data reportedly includes full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and location information, primarily from people in the United States, with some entries from Singapore and the UK. The threat actor categorized the data as part of a broader campaign aimed at selling consumer information for crypto-related marketing, fraud, or recovery schemes. (Source: Dark Web Informer ) Meanwhile, another threat actor using the handle kiki88888 claimed to possess and sell data that belongs to Binance users. This listing allegedly contained more than 132,000 records, including email addresses and passwords. Binance, however, denied that the data originated from a breach of their systems. In a statement, the exchange explained that the leaked data was likely obtained through phishing attacks, with hackers compromising browser sessions using malware rather than through a direct data leak. Dark Web Informer also confirmed this explanation, and urged users to be cautious online and avoid clicking suspicious links. This is not the first time that Binance was targeted by hackers. In September of last year, a hacker known as FireBear claimed to have stolen a database containing 12.8 million records of Binance users, which reportedly included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information. Binance dismissed the claims after an internal security investigation, and stated that the allegations were completely false. The crypto community is facing a wave of cyber threats. Earlier this month, Australian federal police alerted 130 people about a message scam that impersonated major crypto exchanges like Binance. Similarly, on March 14, several X users reported receiving f ake messages imitating Coinbase and Gemini. These messages tried to deceive users into creating new wallets using pre-generated recovery phrases that were controlled by scammers. DOJ Seizes Crypto Funds Tied to Hamas Leaked data is not the only trouble the crypto space is facing. The United States Justice Department recently seized more than $200,000 in cryptocurrency that was allegedly intended to support the militant group Hamas. In a statement that was released on March 27, the DOJ revealed that the $201,400 in funds was linked to fundraising addresses believed to be controlled by Hamas. These addresses were reportedly used to launder more than $1.5 million in digital assets since October of 2024. The laundering process involved a network of virtual currency exchanges, suspected financiers, and over-the-counter brokers. The funds were then dispersed across at least 17 cryptocurrency wallets. (Source: DOJ ) The seizure happened during the broader efforts by US authorities to crack down on the use of cryptocurrency for illicit activities. In January 2024, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, alongside counterparts in the United Kingdom and Australia, imposed sanctions on networks and people facilitating crypto transactions for Hamas. These actions followed earlier sanctions that were introduced in October 2023 targeting the group’s financial networks. Three families of victims of the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel also filed a lawsuit against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao in January of 2024. The lawsuit alleged that the crypto exchange provided necessary assistance to terrorist activities. Binance denied the claims, and its legal representatives stated that the company had no special relationship with Hamas. Binance previously faced some intense regulatory scrutiny in the US over its anti-money laundering controls. This scrutiny ended up culminating in a $4.3 billion settlement with the DOJ in November of 2023. The broader use of cryptocurrency by terrorist organizations like Hamas caused growing concern among US authorities. A December 2024 report by the Congressional Research Service pointed out that Hamas has been looking for crypto donations since at least 2019, although the extent of its success in this area is still unclear. Despite these incidents, a 2023 report from Chainalysis indicated that terrorism financing accounts for only a small fraction of cryptocurrency usage, with most illicit financial activity still taking place through traditional fiat channels. JELLY Token Exploit Exposes DeFi Vulnerabilities Exploits are also still wreaking havoc on the crypto industry. A crypto whale is accused of manipulating the price of the meme coin Jelly my Jelly (JELLY) on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, reportedly earning over $6.26 million in profits from the exploit . According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, the unidentified whale strategically opened three large trading positions within minutes. The whale opened two long positions worth $2.15 million and $1.9 million, alongside a $4.1 million short position intended to offset the longs. When the price of JELLY surged by 400%, the large short position wasn’t immediately liquidated due to its size. Instead, the risk was transferred to Hyperliquid’s Liquidity Provider Vault (HLP), which handles large liquidations. Further investigations by blockchain analyst ZachXBT revealed that the entity behind the manipulation still holds close to $2 million worth of JELLY tokens, controlling around 10% of the token’s supply. The tokens were bought after March 22, 2025, and the whale reportedly continued selling them even after Hyperliquid froze and delisted the meme coin because of evidence of suspicious market activity. The JELLY exploit is the latest in a growing list of meme coin schemes that are designed to capitalize on investor hype. Just weeks earlier, another meme coin inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street suffered a similar fate, and crashed by over 99% after being launched with very large insider holdings. Alvin Kan , the chief operating officer of Bitget Wallet, said the JELLY debacle sheds some light on the dangers of meme coins that are built solely on speculation and hype without any real fundamentals. He warned that projects lacking utility are bound to collapse in a fast-moving and unforgiving market. While Hyperliquid’s intervention helped reduce immediate losses, it also led to debate over whether such actions really compromise the decentralized principles of the platform.",News|Security,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 09:32:50

On March 28, the price of XRP nosedived along with the broader market, with the token seeing one of the steepest drops in value across the board. Data retrieved by Finbold from cryptocurrency statistics platform CoinMarketCap found that XRP’s market cap plummeted by $7.19 billion, falling from around $137 billion to $129.81 billion, dipping under the critical $130 billion threshold and wiping out all weekly gains in one go. XRP market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Weekly and daily losses are pretty much the same, so any progress XRP had made this week has been wiped out. The token fell from a daily high of $2.37 to its current price on Friday of $2.22—over 6% down and a drop of 15 cents from its dollar value. XRP news and price analysis $2.30 had been the support level and the token tested that overnight, but once it gave way, further losses to $2.22 followed within two hours. Now, immediate support sits at $2.20, and bulls will be hoping to hold this level and work back toward the previous support at $2.30. If $2.20 doesn’t hold, things could get ugly. XRP could head toward the $2 mark fast, and psychologically, that would be a tough level for investors to watch fall. There’s some potential support around $2.05, but even that might not stop the bleeding if sentiment keeps sliding. XRP price prediction In terms of XRP’s price prediction, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez pointed out: “If XRP can break above $3, it would invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially flipping the outlook bullish.” If $XRP can break above $3, it would invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially flipping the outlook bullish. pic.twitter.com/B6mrtXm1TS — Ali (@ali_charts) March 28, 2025 At that time, XRP was trading at $2.34—so while the pattern isn’t invalid yet, it’s looking more like a longer-term setup now, especially after this drop. For now, it’s all about whether XRP can hold above $2.20. If not, Friday could close red and push the token closer to a full breakdown toward $2 flat.

However, despite this, he has faced immense backlash from the community due to his past comments on the Ripple Vs SEC case. XRP News: Gemini Pushes For Ripple’s Coin The discussions on the current development started when Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, conducted an X poll asking users if they would use a card that offers cashback in XRP. Out of over 5,000 participants voting, an overwhelming 94.1% responded positively. Following the poll, Gemini’s growth marketing lead, Ethan Kimmel, highlighted the company’s existing credit card program. He shared an image showcasing a Gemini card offering “4% back in XRP” on purchases at charging stations. “5,000 people should be signing up today for the Gemini Credit Card,” Kimmel stated. Meanwhile, Winklevoss further amplified the message, calling on Ripple Army to use Gemini’s card. He stated, “Earn XRP back with the Gemini Credit Card every time you swipe.” However, his statement wasn’t received well by everyone in the XRP community. XRP Community Reacts Over Past Comments Despite Gemini’s new push for XRP, many community members remain skeptical due to Winklevoss’ past remarks. In 2020, he dismissed XRP supporters, stating, “The XRP army has really dumb trolls. By tagging the SEC Enforcement, you are taking the position that Ripple is a security.” Source: Dom Kwok, X Dom Kwok, who initiated the poll, resurfaced Winklevoss’ old statement, cautioning XRP holders not to forget past criticisms. “They wanna kick you when you’re down, but kick it when you’re up. Never forget,” he posted, reigniting the debate. Meanwhile, Gemini refrained from listing XRP for years, citing regulatory uncertainties. However, in 2023, following Ripple’s court victory against the SEC, the exchange finally added the token. While this was seen as a win for XRP, some community members remain wary of Gemini’s true intentions. One critic pointed out the irony of Winklevoss’ latest marketing push, stating, “Calling XRP holders dumb trolls and then trying to get them to use your credit card is as ironic as it gets.” What’s More? The backlash doesn’t end there. The XRP community has also highlighted that Winklevoss opposed the inclusion of XRP in the proposed US crypto reserve recently. It further sparked discussions and many have reacted amid the ongoing BTC Vs XRP war . In addition, as Ripple executives hint towards a potential end in the Ripple vs SEC case , many deem this development behind Winklevoss and Gemini’s latest push. However, despite the positive announcement, XRP price was down nearly 6% today amid a broader crypto market selloff.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $13.78, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $22.84 or beyond. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is of cautious optimism, with stakeholders closely monitoring its progress and evolution. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects. Overview Cryptocurrency NEAR Protocol Ticker NEAR Price $2.81 Market Cap $3,372,156,205.9 Trading Volume 24-h $178,168,811.07 Circulating Supply 1,197,821,504 NEAR All-time High $20.42 Jan 17, 2022 All-time Low $0.526, Nov 04, 2020 24-h High $3.04 24-h Low $2.81 NEAR Protocol price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Neutral 50-Day SMA $3.02 200-Day SMA $4.67 Price Prediction $6.08 (115.79%) F & G Index 20.33 (extreme fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 14-Day RSI 71.18 NEAR Protocol price analysis: Near rejected at $3.00 TL;DR Breakdown: NEAR Protocol price analysis shows a fall to the $2.85 mark NEAR price fell by over 3.2% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.50 and $3.00, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for March 28 shows that the price rose to the $3.00 mark as bulls found support at $2.50. However, the selling pressure remains high making it difficult to cross the key level and has caused the price to fall back to $2.80. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR rises to the $3.00 mark The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the NEAR price trades in a bearish market since failing to climb past the $8.00 mark. The price fell to the $5.00 level but the bulls managed to recover to the $6.00 level. The recovery was short-lived as after a couple of ups and downs, the bears came out on top and the price dropped to the $2.50 level where it traded in recent days before attempting the $3.00 price level. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart The Indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment as all three major technical indicators signal rising bearish price sentiments. The MACD is bullish at 0.064 units and suggests steady bullish momentum. Moreover, the EMAs are around the mean position, and the indicator shows declining bullish momentum. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 48.65 from above the 50.00 index level. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest decreasing volatility, indicating that the $2.80 support may hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR has been trading inside a steady upward channel since mid-March as the bulls controlled the market. While the bulls did attempt to break out of the channel on March 25th, the lack of momentum caused the asset’s price to break down further, leading to a drop to the $2.80 price level. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The RSI is at 66.45, suggesting that the asset is near the overbought zone, which indicates that it has less room for further upward movement. However, the horizontal slope suggests decreasing selling pressure on the asset, suggesting further consolidation. The MACD is bullish, with the MACD line at 0.019 showing bullish dominance across the 4-hour charts. This dominance has been increasing in recent candles as NEAR rose to $3.00. These indicators collectively issue a steady bullish trend that suggests a return towards $3.30. NEAR Protocol technical indicators: Levels and actions Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 3.75 SELL SMA 5 $ 3.43 SELL SMA 10 $ 3.23 SELL SMA 21 $ 2.88 SELL SMA 50 $ 3.12 SELL SMA 100 $ 4.03 SELL SMA 200 $ 4.73 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 2.92 SELL EMA 5 $ 3.16 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.70 SELL EMA 21 $ 4.39 SELL EMA 50 $ 5.07 SELL EMA 100 $ 5.26 SELL EMA 200 $ 5.21 SELL What to expect from NEAR Protocol price analysis? NEAR Protocol price analysis NEAR ended its bearish rally at the $2.30 mark, a key support to the asset that has been tested many times. The strong trade volume suggests decreasing trade activity suggesting that the sell-off may be over. Currently, the bulls are trying to defend the $2.80 support level as traders seek stability. Traders should expect NEAR to break through from around the $2.85 level for the next few days as the bulls generate momentum. However, the bulls must defend key levels to prevent a breakdown below $2.65. Currently, the closest support level is $2.80 and below at $2.65, while NEAR Protocol faces difficulty establishing a foothold above the $3.00 level. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR down? NEAR price rose rapidly to the $7.500 mark. However, the bulls failed to secure a foothold above $5.00, and the price has come crashing down in the last ten days. Now, the price hovers around $3.00 as either side struggles for a breakout. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the end of 2027. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next decade. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development. However, the project must keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|NEAR|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-28 09:40:00
42522738,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144245,1743154828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Galaxy Digital $200M Settlement: LUNA Interests Exposed!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galaxy-digital-luna-settlement/,"In a stunning turn of events that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency sphere, Galaxy Digital, a prominent crypto financial services firm led by Michael Novogratz, has agreed to a hefty $200 million settlement. This settlement, announced by the New York Attorney General’s office and first reported by Axios, shines a harsh light on the firm’s dealings with the now-infamous LUNA token. But what exactly went down, and what does this mean for the future of crypto regulation and investor trust? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking case. Decoding the Galaxy Digital Settlement and LUNA Token Allegations The core of the issue lies in allegations that Galaxy Digital violated the Martin Act and Executive Law. These laws are designed to protect investors by ensuring transparency and preventing fraudulent activities in financial markets. The Attorney General’s office accuses Galaxy Digital of promoting LUNA without properly disclosing its own significant financial interests in the token. This lack of transparency is a major point of contention, raising serious questions about ethical practices within the cryptocurrency industry. According to the legal filing, the accusations paint a picture of strategic maneuvering by Galaxy Digital. Here’s a breakdown of the key allegations: Undisclosed Financial Interest: Galaxy Digital allegedly failed to reveal that it held a substantial stake in LUNA tokens while actively promoting the cryptocurrency to investors. This is a critical violation as it creates a conflict of interest and potentially misleads investors. Inflating LUNA’s Price: The Attorney General claims that Galaxy Digital and its CEO, Michael Novogratz, engaged in activities aimed at artificially inflating the price of LUNA. This manipulation could have enticed unsuspecting investors to buy into LUNA at inflated prices. Secret Token Sales: While promoting LUNA, Galaxy Digital was allegedly selling off its own LUNA holdings. The filing states that Galaxy acquired 18.5 million LUNA tokens at a substantial 30% discount. From these sales, they reportedly profited over $100 million. These transactions were not disclosed to the public while the firm continued to advocate for LUNA. The implications of these actions are significant, not just for Galaxy Digital but for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The settlement underscores the growing scrutiny from regulatory bodies and the increasing pressure for crypto firms to operate with greater transparency and accountability. Michael Novogratz and Galaxy Digital’s Role: A Closer Look Michael Novogratz, the high-profile CEO of Galaxy Digital, is personally implicated in these allegations. As a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Novogratz’s endorsements carry considerable weight within the crypto community. The accusations suggest that his public promotion of LUNA may have been intertwined with Galaxy Digital’s undisclosed financial interests, raising questions about the objectivity and integrity of such endorsements. Let’s consider the timeline and potential impact: Event Details Potential Impact Galaxy Digital acquires 18.5M LUNA tokens at a discount. Secures tokens at 30% below market price. Positions Galaxy for significant profit if LUNA price increases. Galaxy Digital and Novogratz promote LUNA. Publicly advocate for LUNA as a promising investment. Attracts investors, potentially driving up demand and price. Undisclosed LUNA sales occur. Galaxy sells off its LUNA holdings while promoting it. Profits from sales while potentially contributing to price instability if done on a large scale without transparency. LUNA’s collapse and subsequent investigation. Terra ecosystem implodes, leading to massive investor losses and regulatory scrutiny. Triggers investigations into firms involved with LUNA, including Galaxy Digital. The settlement now requires Galaxy Digital to pay $200 million over three years, with an initial payment of $40 million due within two weeks. This financial penalty is a stark reminder of the potential consequences of regulatory violations in the crypto space. Cryptocurrency Regulation: Why This Settlement Matters This settlement is more than just a financial penalty for Galaxy Digital; it’s a significant milestone in the ongoing push for cryptocurrency regulation. The case highlights the complexities and challenges regulators face in overseeing the rapidly evolving crypto market. The use of the Martin Act, a powerful New York state law often used to combat securities fraud, demonstrates the seriousness with which authorities are now treating crypto-related misconduct. Key takeaways regarding cryptocurrency regulation from this case: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Crypto firms should expect heightened attention from regulatory bodies like the SEC and state attorneys general. Compliance is no longer optional; it’s a necessity. Transparency is Paramount: Disclosing financial interests, especially when promoting assets, is crucial. Lack of transparency can lead to severe legal and financial repercussions. Investor Protection Focus: Regulators are prioritizing investor protection in the crypto market. Actions that mislead or harm investors will be met with strong enforcement. Precedent Setting: This settlement could set a precedent for future cases involving crypto firms and regulatory violations. It signals that regulators are willing to take decisive action against misconduct. The Aftermath of Terra Luna Collapse: Lessons Learned The Terra Luna collapse was a catastrophic event that wiped out billions of dollars in investor wealth and shook confidence in the crypto market. The Galaxy Digital settlement is a direct consequence of the fallout from this collapse. It serves as a painful reminder of the risks associated with unregulated or under-regulated crypto assets and the importance of due diligence for investors. What can investors and the crypto industry learn from the Terra Luna collapse and the Galaxy Digital settlement? Risk Assessment is Crucial: Investors must thoroughly assess the risks associated with any cryptocurrency investment, understanding the underlying technology, tokenomics, and potential vulnerabilities. Beware of Hype: Be wary of celebrity endorsements and promotional campaigns, especially if they lack transparency about financial interests. Conduct independent research. Demand Transparency: Support and advocate for crypto projects and firms that prioritize transparency and ethical practices. Hold them accountable. Regulatory Clarity Needed: The crypto industry needs clearer and more comprehensive regulatory frameworks to protect investors and foster sustainable growth. Engage in constructive dialogue with regulators. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape The Galaxy Digital settlement is a wake-up call for the crypto industry. It underscores the need for greater maturity, responsibility, and adherence to ethical standards. For investors, it reinforces the importance of caution, research, and understanding the risks involved in crypto investments. For crypto firms, it’s a clear message that regulatory compliance and transparency are no longer optional but essential for long-term survival and success. Here are some actionable insights for stakeholders: For Crypto Investors: Diversify your portfolio, conduct thorough research before investing, understand the risks, and be skeptical of hype. Stay informed about regulatory developments. For Crypto Firms: Prioritize regulatory compliance, ensure transparency in all operations, disclose financial interests, and build trust with your community. Invest in robust compliance and legal frameworks. For Regulators: Continue to develop clear and balanced regulatory frameworks that protect investors without stifling innovation. Collaborate with the industry to foster responsible growth. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Crypto Accountability? The $200 million settlement between Galaxy Digital and the New York Attorney General marks a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies a growing trend of regulatory bodies taking a firmer stance on crypto misconduct and demanding accountability. While the Terra Luna collapse was a devastating event, the subsequent investigations and settlements, like this one, are crucial steps towards building a more mature, transparent, and trustworthy crypto ecosystem. The journey to full regulatory clarity and investor protection is ongoing, but this settlement sends a powerful message: the era of unchecked promotion and undisclosed interests in crypto is coming to an end.

Sign Is Up for Auction",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/28/iconic-mt-gox-where-is-our-money-sign-is-up-for-auction,"One cold February morning in 2014, Kolin Burges stood outside Mt. Gox's Tokyo office, clutching a handwritten cardboard sign and demanding answers from the bitcoin exchange's CEO, Mark Karpeles, about his missing tokens. Eleven years later, the iconic sign, emblematic of crypto's first major financial scanda l, is being auctioned on Scare.City with a reserve price of 4.5 BTC ($383,000). The sale starts later Friday and ends April 3. ""At the time, it didn't even cross my mind it could become valuable,"" Burges said in an interview with CoinDesk in Hong Kong. ""I thought maybe I'd write a book someday, but the sign itself never seemed important. It's remarkable how things have evolved."" Burges had flown from London to Tokyo after Mt. Gox, then the world's largest bitcoin exchange, mysteriously froze withdrawals. ""I woke up one morning and knew I had to go to Tokyo,"" Burges recalled. ""I didn't really have a detailed plan. I just knew I had to be there. ""When the withdrawal didn't arrive, I started feeling this growing sense of dread. At first, I wasn't 100% sure, but as time went on, it became increasingly clear something was very wrong."" His impromptu protest quickly gained international media attention, even attracting the notice of mainstream financial press like the Wall Street Journal. Burges recalled those initial days in Tokyo as dreamlike and almost otherworldly. ""The moment I confronted Karpeles was intense,"" he remembered. ""I demanded answers, but he just brushed me off, blaming technical issues. It felt surreal, standing there in the snow, knowing something major was unfolding."" As Burges protested outside Mt. Gox's offices, the exchange's attempts to mitigate the public fallout became increasingly evident. ""Mt. Gox kept dangling hope, but everyone could see the situation spiraling out of control,"" Burges said. ""They even invited us inside to protest privately. Anything to remove us from public view. It was ridiculous and desperate."" Burges recalls how over drinks, someone from Mt. Gox, whom he declined to name, privately pressured him to cut it out. ""At one point, Mt. Gox representatives met me secretly, warning that continued protests would cause the exchange to collapse and everyone would lose their bitcoins,"" he said. ""That conversation made it clear they knew more than they admitted, and the situation was far worse than publicly acknowledged."" Then, Burges recollects, one representative tried paying for their drinks with a Mt. Gox credit card — and it was declined. ""It was an ominous sign their banking relationships were unraveling,"" Burges said. Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, days after Burges started his protest. Seven years later, Karpeles was found innocent of embezzlement in a Tokyo court, while receiving a suspended sentence for manipulating data. Last September, Karpeles set up a new crypto exchange, EllipX . He also established a crypto ratings company called Ungox in 2022. In an interview with CoinDesk on the sidelines of Korea Blockchain Week in August 2024, Karples said that if he had modern blockchain analytical tools in 2014, and third-party custodians, Mt. Gox ""wouldn't have happened.""",Markets|Mt.

New Authorization Process For Crypto Companies Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), shared in an interview with CoinDesk that the “gateway regime” set for 2026 will introduce a new authorization process for crypto companies. “We will have a gateway which will allow authorization. But obviously we’ve got to go through those consultations, create those rules and get the legislation for that to take place,” Long noted. Notably, the new regime will go beyond the current anti-money laundering (AML) rules. Crypto companies like Coinbase, Gemini, and Bitpanda will need to undergo a new approval process with the FCA, instead of just registering to comply with AML rules. This will involve meeting stricter requirements for a wider range of services they provide. FCA to Finalize Crypto Rules by 2026 Besides, the FCA plans to release new papers this year on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, and more. The full new crypto regulations are expected to be finalized in 2026, once the final policy papers are published. Since opening its anti-money laundering (AML) register in 2020, the FCA has received 368 applications from firms looking to comply. However, only 50 of those firms, or 14%, have been approved. This means many companies may need to go through the process again under the new regime. The U.K. is preparing new rules that will define which crypto activities need FCA approval. This includes things like stablecoin issuance, crypto payments, exchanges, and lending services. FCA to Propose New Stablecoin Rules Stablecoins won’t be regulated under the same rules as payments, as originally planned. Instead, the FCA will consult on new stablecoin rules later this year. Matthew Long noted that they’re working to adapt existing financial regulations to fit the unique nature of stablecoins. The FCA is still finalizing the process for crypto companies to get authorized under the new regime. While it’s unclear what steps those already registered will need to take, the new rules will offer broader permissions. Companies may also need to reapply for approval. The FCA aims to launch the new regime as soon as possible, while also considering Europe’s regulations and IOSCO’s recommendations for best practices.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 09:49:02

Within just two days of its launch, the token has secured listings on major exchanges like Gate.io, BingX, and AscendEX, fueling its rapid rise in popularity. GHIBLI Rides the OpenAI AI Art Wave GHIBLI’s surge is closely linked to OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o model update , which introduced AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style artwork. The trend has captivated social media, with big names like Elon Musk and Michael Saylor joining in, further boosting GHIBLI’s exposure. As a result, the token’s value has shot up by 44.4% in just 24 hours, hitting a market cap of $27.5 million. This hype pushed GHIBLI, a Solana meme coin, to $28.3M before dropping to $18M. Another coin, GhibliCZ, also saw wild price swings. While fans love the nostalgic feel, critics say AI is copying Ghibli’s unique style, which its co-founder Miyazaki strongly opposes. Despite the buzz, Studio Ghibli hasn’t said a word about it yet. Even Shaw, the founder of a16z, joined the trend by changing his profile picture to a Ghibli-style cartoon. Exchange Listings Fuel GHIBLI’s Growth Gate.io was among the first to list GHIBLI, adding it to its Pilot Section—a platform for trending, early-stage crypto projects. Similarly, BingX placed it in its Innovation Zone but warned investors about the potential volatility of newly launched tokens. Meanwhile, OXFUN took things up a notch by offering leveraged trading, allowing traders to amplify their positions. The excitement around GHIBLI is evident, with trading volumes surpassing Ethereum on OXFUN. Other platforms, including HTX, AscendEX, and CoinEx, quickly followed suit, further increasing the token’s accessibility and liquidity. Elon Musk and Michael Saylor Join the Hype Memecoins react to hype and support from celebrities, influencers. Following the trend, Elon Musk humorously posted a Ghibli-style image of himself holding Dogecoin’s mascot, calling it the “theme of the day.” Michael Saylor, on the other hand, used the trend to show his pro-Bitcoin stance. Their support of the memecoin quickly gave fame to this low-cap asset. This shows how the market reacts to hype and craze. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CTO’s Ghibli Image Has Crypto Fans Wondering ‘XRP Price Pump When?’ , Crypto Reaction The #GhibliAI trend is blowing up on X and Instagram, with millions of people sharing posts.

Now picture relentless, unwelcome guests – AI crawlers – barging in, ignoring the ‘keep out’ signs, and potentially trampling everything underfoot. This isn’t a dystopian sci-fi scenario; it’s the reality many open source developers are facing today. Frustrated by web scraping bots that disregard the rules, these developers are deploying ingenious and often humorous tactics to protect their digital gardens. Let’s dive into this fascinating clash between human ingenuity and unchecked AI. The Uninvited Guests: Understanding the AI Web Crawlers Problem Why are AI crawlers causing such a stir in the open source community? It boils down to a few key factors: Resource Drain: Open source projects, often run on limited resources, are disproportionately affected by aggressive crawling. These bots can overload servers, leading to slow performance or even site outages. Ignoring the Rules: The internet has a long-standing tradition of polite bot behavior, governed by the robots.txt protocol. This file is meant to guide bots on what parts of a site should not be crawled. However, many modern AI web scraping bots simply ignore these directives. Lack of Transparency: Unlike search engine crawlers, which generally aim to index content for public benefit, the purpose of many AI crawlers is less clear and often feels exploitative to developers. DDoS-like Impact: The sheer volume of requests from misbehaving AI crawlers can mimic a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, unintentionally or intentionally disrupting services. As Niccolò Venerandi, a prominent open source developer, points out, the very nature of FOSS projects—open infrastructure and fewer resources—makes them particularly vulnerable. Xe Iaso, another developer, vividly described the onslaught of AmazonBot, which relentlessly attacked a Git server, causing significant disruptions. Iaso’s experience is a stark example of how AI crawlers can behave like digital pests, disregarding boundaries and causing havoc. Anubis Rises: A Clever Defense Against Web Scraping Bots Faced with this digital pest problem, Xe Iaso didn’t just lament; they innovated. The result? Anubis, a brilliantly named and effective tool. But what exactly is Anubis, and how does it fight back against these intrusive web scraping bots ? Anubis in Action: Reverse Proxy Proof-of-Work: Anubis acts as a gatekeeper, a reverse proxy that sits in front of a Git server. It presents a challenge – a proof-of-work – that human browsers can easily solve, but automated bots struggle with. Human vs. Bot Detection: This challenge effectively distinguishes between legitimate human users and automated AI crawlers . Only those who successfully pass the test are granted access. Egyptian Mythology Inspiration: The name “Anubis” is no accident. Just like the Egyptian god who judges souls, this tool judges web requests, deciding who gets access to the digital realm. Humorous Reward: For humans who pass the challenge, Anubis offers a playful reward – a cute anime picture, Iaso’s anthropomorphic take on the god himself. Bots, of course, are denied entry. The response to Anubis has been nothing short of phenomenal. Within days of being shared on GitHub, it garnered thousands of stars, demonstrating the widespread need for such solutions within the open source community. This rapid adoption highlights the collective frustration and the desire to reclaim control over their online spaces. Vengeance or Defense? Other Tactics in the AI Crawler Battle Anubis is just one approach. The open source community, known for its creativity and collaborative spirit, is exploring various ways to counter aggressive AI crawlers . Here are some other tactics emerging in this digital arms race: Tactic Description Pros Cons Country Blocking (e.g., Brazil, China): Blocking entire countries based on IP address ranges. Drastic measure to stop overwhelming traffic from specific regions. Overly broad, may block legitimate users, blunt instrument. Nepenthes (Poison Trap): Luring bots into an endless maze of fake content to waste their resources and potentially feed them misinformation. “Vengeance as defense,” actively harms misbehaving bots. Potentially aggressive, ethically questionable, resource intensive to maintain. Cloudflare AI Labyrinth: Similar to Nepenthes, feeds irrelevant content to misbehaving crawlers to slow them down and waste resources. Commercial-grade solution, potentially more robust and easier to deploy. Reliance on a third-party service. “Poisoned” robots.txt: Serving forbidden pages filled with negative or misleading content when bots ignore robots.txt , aiming to degrade the quality of their training data. Passive-aggressive defense, potentially impacts bot utility. Effectiveness is debatable, may not significantly deter determined crawlers. The experiences shared by prominent figures like Drew DeVault of SourceHut and Jonathan Corbet of LWN underscore the severity of the problem. DeVault described spending a significant portion of his time battling AI crawlers , while Corbet reported DDoS-level traffic impacting his news site. Kevin Fenzi, from the Fedora project, even resorted to blocking entire countries to mitigate the onslaught. The Bigger Picture: Respecting Digital Boundaries At its core, the fight against aggressive AI crawlers is about respect – respect for digital boundaries and the resources of open source projects. The robots.txt protocol, while not a technical barrier, represents a social contract on the internet. When web scraping bots ignore this contract, it erodes trust and necessitates defensive measures. Drew DeVault’s plea to “stop legitimizing LLMs…” reflects a deeper concern about the ethics and sustainability of AI development. While tools like Anubis and Nepenthes offer technical solutions, they also highlight the need for a broader conversation about responsible AI behavior and the importance of respecting the digital commons. Key Takeaways: Defending Against AI Web Scraping Bots The Challenge is Real: Aggressive AI crawlers pose a significant threat to open source infrastructure, causing resource drain and potential outages. robots.txt is Not Enough: Relying solely on robots.txt is no longer sufficient as many AI web scraping bots disregard it. Ingenuity is Key: Open source developers are demonstrating remarkable creativity in developing defensive tools like Anubis and Nepenthes. Community Response: The rapid adoption of Anubis highlights the collective nature of this problem and the power of community-driven solutions. Beyond Technical Fixes: The issue raises broader questions about ethical AI behavior and the need for respect in the digital ecosystem. The Fight Continues The battle against aggressive AI crawlers is likely to be ongoing. As AI technology evolves, so too will the tactics of both crawlers and defenders. The ingenuity and determination of the open source community, however, offer a beacon of hope. Their fight is not just about protecting their own projects; it’s about advocating for a more respectful and sustainable internet for everyone.

Management's expectations for the Yguazú facility in Paraguay are overly optimistic; HIVE's projected 3% network hashrate is unlikely due to rising competition. HIVE's perpetual share dilution and volatile stock price make it unattractive for long-term investors, despite potential short-term gains from Bitcoin price spikes. I recommend avoiding HIVE for long-term investments, as Bitcoin mining remains inconsistent and unprofitable, with HIVE's core business valued as essentially worthless. It's been a while since I last wrote about HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE ) . In my last article, I was quite skeptical about HIVE's pivot to AI, as the company was a minnow in the land of giants like Amazon ( AMZN ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Alphabet (GOOG) ( GOOGL ) when it comes to serving AI workloads. So far, it appears my skepticism was not misplaced, as HIVE's stock price has nearly halved since September 2023, while the rest of the market has soared (Figure 1). Figure 1 - HIVE has plunged while the markets have soared (Seeking Alpha) However, in recent weeks, HIVE has been hyping its acquisition of the Yguazú site in Paraguay, which the company believes will catapult it to be one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world (Figure 2). Figure 2 - Yguazu set to catapult HIVE to be one of the largest miners ( HIVE Presentation ) Is Yguazú truly transformational, and will it boost HIVE's stock price in the coming quarters? In my opinion, management's Yguazú projections are too optimistic. Even if fully built out, HIVE will unlikely command 3% of network hashrate, as the rest of the market will also add capacity. Furthermore, it will take tens of millions in capital to build out Yguazú and acquire the ASICs. This will mean tens of millions of shares will need to be issued, diluting shareholders. Overall, I continue to view Bitcoin mining as a mug's game that does not lead to consistent profits. While short-term traders may be able to profit from periodic squeezes on HIVE's stock, long-term investors should stay away. Brief Company Overview First, since it has been a while since I last analyzed the company, it may be worthwhile to refresh my understanding of HIVE's operations and capabilities. HIVE's core business remains its Bitcoin mining operations, which currently operate at 6 Exahash/s (""EH/s"") (Figure 3). Figure 3 - HIVE's footprint ( HIVE Investor Presentation ) HIVE also has a nascent high-performance compute (""HPC"") business that serves up AI workloads in 3rd tier datacenters using NVIDIA GPUs (Figure 4). Figure 4 - HIVE has a nascent HPC/AI business ( HIVE Investor Presentation ) Looking through HIVE's recent financial reports and presentations, there are 3 yellow flags that I want to caution readers about. HPC Still A Rounding Error First, readers may recall in my prior note that I was highly skeptical of HIVE's pivot to high-performance computing (""HPC"") since the company simply cannot compete with the AI giants like Amazon and Microsoft in their access to capital, NVIDIA chips, and client workloads. Sure enough, more than a year after the HPC business launched, HIVE has recorded a mere $7 million in HPC revenues, or $9.3 million annualized, for the 9-months ended December 31, 2024 (Figure 5). Figure 5 - HPC has been a dud so far (Company Reports) This is an insignificant rounding error compared to outsourced HPC leaders like CoreWeave ( CRWV ), which recorded $1.9 billion in 2024 revenues. In my opinion, the problem with HIVE's HPC business is its lack of scale and access to bleeding-edge chips. Of the company's fleet of 4,096 GPUs, HIVE only has 96 NVIDIA H100 GPUs in operation that are comparable to those from the market leaders. The rest are outdated legacy NVIDIA A-series GPUs (approximately 2,500 A40s, 250 A6000s, and 1,250 A5000s) that are not in demand. HIVE has a 'chicken-and-the-egg' problem. Without access to large amounts of capital, HIVE cannot buy enough chips to attract blue-chip clients like Microsoft (who leases capacity from HIVE competitors like CoreWeave). Is Paraguay The Future? Moving on, HIVE has been promoting its acquisition of Bitfarm's Yguazú facility in recent months. According to company reports, Yguazú will allow HIVE to leapfrog some of its peers to become one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world by September 2025 (Figure 6). Figure 6 - HIVE set to grow to 25 EH/s ( HIVE Investor Presentation ) In fact, HIVE posted a slide in its latest investor presentation that suggests the company can generate upwards of $330 million in annualized mining margin once the 25 EH/s in capacity is ramped up, assuming Bitcoin prices of $100k (Figure 7). Figure 7 - Illustrative Bitcoin mining margins ( HIVE Investor Presentation ) However, I believe these figures by HIVE may be too optimistic. For example, Figure 7 assumes HIVE mines 13.5 Bitcoins per day at 25 EH/s since HIVE controls 3% of the global network hashrate (~833 EH/s). Unfortunately, we know Bitcoin network hashrates are constantly rising. For example, just in the last twelve months, the Bitcoin network hashrate has increased from 586 EH to 839 EH, or an increase of 43% (Figure 8). In the past 3 years, network hashrates have increased at a 60% CAGR. Figure 8 - Bitcoin network hashrate is constantly rising (blockchain.com) Therefore, it is highly unlikely that network hashrates will stay constant at 833 EH/s until CQ3/25 while HIVE builds out the Yguazú facility. In fact, just looking at the public competitors in Figure 6, cumulative capacity is expected to increase by 95 EH by CQ3/25! Assuming capacity increases at a 45% annualized rate, the network hashrate would be ~1,000 EH/s by CQ3/25, which means HIVE's market share is likely going to end up at 2.5% and falling by the time Yguazú comes online. So the number of Bitcoins mined per day by HIVE should be ~20% lower, and its cost to produce a Bitcoin should be ~20% higher. Furthermore, even when the facility is built out, HIVE still needs to buy the ASICs to mine Bitcoins. With a depleted cash balance of only $9.8 million (excluding its digital assets that are HODL'ed), how will HIVE finance its acquisition of mining equipment (Figure 9)? Figure 9 - Abbreviated HIVE balance sheet (Company Reports) Perpetual Issuing Machine In my opinion, one of the main reasons HIVE's share price keeps plunging lower and lower is because the company, like many of its peers, is in perpetual fund-raising mode. In the past year alone, HIVE's share count has increased from 86 million to 119 million shares, or a 38% dilution (Figure 10). Figure 10 - Bitcoin miners are perpetual dilutors ( HIVE Investor Presentation ) With management constantly ""hitting the bid"" using at-the-market (""ATM"") issuances, it is hard for the stock to make any kind of positive moves. Who Trumpets Volatility? Finally, one slide from HIVE's presentation that I take particular issue with is Figure 11, which trumpets the stock volatility. Figure 11 - HIVE trumpets its volatility ( HIVE Investor Presentation ) Management seems to take pride in the fact that HIVE's shares have volatility (measured as the standard deviation of its price moves) more than twice that of Bitcoin. However, it is important to note that volatility is not the same as value . Bitcoin, for all its volatility, has generally delivered positive returns over the past 2 years, rising from a low of ~$18k to over $100k, before its recent pullback to $88k (Figure 12). Figure 12 - Bitcoin vs. HIVE (Author created using stockcharts.com) HIVE, on the other hand, is trading at roughly the same stock price from 2 years ago, despite Bitcoin more than quintupling, which should have theoretically boosted its margins. Risk To Being Cautious HIVE In my opinion, HIVE, and its Bitcoin mining peers, are perpetual money-losing enterprises that are best avoided. However, I would not short its shares either because of the short-squeeze risk. In particular, the company's valuation has dropped to low enough levels that it may rally strongly if Bitcoin prices were to rise suddenly. This is because HIVE holds on its balance sheet over 2,800 Bitcoins, which is worth close to $250 million at today's prices (Figure 13). Figure 13 - HIVE holds 2,800 Bitcoins in treasury ( HIVE Investor Presentation ) This is roughly the same as the company's Enterprise Value, which means the equity markets deem HIVE's operations as essentially worthless (Figure 14). Figure 14 - HIVE valuation (Seeking Alpha) Take the MSTR/GME Strategy Route In my opinion, what management should do is shut down its operations, fire all of its employees, and convert into a quasi-Bitcoin hedge fund like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy has been hugely successful in issuing zero-coupon bonds to buy Bitcoins, boosting its valuations in the process and creating a modern 'perpetual motion machine'. If HIVE announces such a conversion, I expect its share price will react very positively, similar to how GME shares got a large temporary boost when it announced a similar strategy change a few days ago. Conclusion Revisiting HIVE after more than a year, I find there is little to get excited about the company's shares. So far, the company's pivot to HPC/AI has been a dud, delivering less than $10 million in ARR in the red-hot AI market. In its core Bitcoin mining business, the much-hyped Yguazú acquisition may be less than it appears on paper. Building out Yguazú and bringing capacity to 25 EH/s will take tens of millions in capital, which will come from the issuance of tens of millions of shares. Even if HIVE boosts its hashrate to 25 EH/s, the company will unlikely command 3% of the Bitcoin network hashrate as management predicts, since its competitors are also busy adding capacity. Overall, I continue to believe Bitcoin mining is a mug's game that does not lead to consistent profits. In fact, equity investors are essentially valuing HIVE's core businesses as being worthless. In the short-term, HIVE's shares may squeeze higher if Bitcoin prices were to rise sharply. However, I continue to recommend long-term investors avoid HIVE.",HIVE|HIVE:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-28 09:52:12

Recent Fed announcements, including slowing Quantitative Tightening, are bullish for Bitcoin; historical trends suggest a potential rally starting in April. Technical analysis indicates Bitcoin could reach $120,000, supported by key EMAs and RSI reset; the current sell-off presents a buying opportunity. Risks include the unwinding of the yen carry trade, which could impact US assets and Bitcoin. Overall, I remain long-term bullish on Bitcoin. Thesis Summary In spite of numerous catalysts provided by the current administration, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is down over 20% from its all-time high and has been trading in a tight range for weeks. It seems like whenever President Trump mentions Bitcoin, markets tend to react by selling the news. While support and acceptance from the US government is no doubt a tailwind for Bitcoin, this asset trades according to global macro. Investors should ignore the noise made by the White House and instead focus on the guidance provided by the Federal Reserve and other Central Banks around the world. Bitcoin has been grinding higher since the last Fed meeting, and it’s no surprise once we actually analyze what was said. Buy The Rumour, Sell the News The Bitcoin price is pretty clear on this. Whenever Trump mentions Bitcoin, you buy the rumour and sell the news. Bitcoin Price And Trump Mentions (TV) On July 27th, 2024, President Trump was a speaker at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, and he announced his intention of introducing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Big run-up leading up to the event, followed by an even larger sell-off afterwards. On January 23rd, the White House issued an Executive Order announcing a Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which would be in charge of evaluating the potential for a crypto reserve. Again, we saw excitement leading up to the event and then a sell-off. And finally, on March 2nd, Trump announced online that the crypto reserve was a go and that it would also include some altcoins. In this case, we saw a big squeeze minutes after this was announced, but within hours, markets began to sell this news too. While many expected Bitcoin to explode higher with the White House on its side, Bitcoin has been struggling the last couple of months. For the time being, the talk has yet to materialize, and even if, for example, a strategic reserve is announced, it’s still unclear if this will have a significant effect on demand. Bitcoin Listens To The Fed Bitcoin has always been an asset that trades with liquidity, which is why Bitcoin listens to the Fed, not Trump. BTC Price and Fed Meeting (TV) Like the broader market, Bitcoin reacted quite positively to the last Fed meeting. Why? Although rates were left unchanged, the Committee announced that it would be slowing down the pace of Quantitative Tightening. Starting in April, QT will slow down from $25 billion to $5 billion in terms of monthly redemptions. This is great news for Bitcoin, and there have also been other catalysts. China, for example, looks to have shifted gears, and may be poised to carry out more fiscal and monetary stimulus. And Europe, led by Germany , is also pushing more in terms of fiscal stimulus. And this, in my opinion, is being partly facilitated by the weaker dollar, which is also very bullish for Bitcoin if we look at historical precedent. USD and BTC (Steno Research) The USD usually leads the Bitcoin price by a few months, and the chart above would suggest Bitcoin could begin to rally starting in April. Technical Analysis This still lines up well with our technical assessment of Bitcoin. BTC TA (Trendspider) Here we have the weekly chart on Bitcoin. I believe we have to make another high to complete a five-wave impulse from the 2022 lows. We’re still above key EMAs, and with the RSI now reset lower, this is a perfect set-up for a final push-up. Baked on fib extensions, this could get us towards $120,000, which is the 2 extensions of the bear market. Risks Bitcoin is a macro asset, in my opinion, and it trades according to macro conditions. In this regard, I believe Bitcoin’s bullish outlook could be derailed by another important macro phenomenon: the unwinding of the yen carry trade. I talked about this in-depth in my last macro article. In short, the Yen is strengthening as inflation becomes a threat in Japan, and if the BoJ raises rates, this could really hurt US assets and also Bitcoin. Final Thoughts In conclusion, when it comes to Bitcoin, it pays to follow the Fed and liquidity, not the news cycle.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) may stay in consolidation as analysts question whether liquidity growth alone can drive a rally, noting that while global liquidity often rises alongside BTC’s price, the connection might not be as strong as some traders think. 📃 #MatrixOnTarget Report – Mar 28, 2025 THIS Liquidity Indicator Nails Bitcoin Turns—Again? #Matrixport #BTC #Crypto #CryptoInvestors #Trump #Bitcoin #USDT #Trading #BTCETF #Global #Market pic.twitter.com/HHZ01Ibbvm — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) March 28, 2025 In an X post on Friday, March 28, Matrixport’s analysts noted that when central banks expand the money supply, some of that liquidity eventually flows into crypto markets. However, they cautioned that this doesn’t guarantee higher Bitcoin prices, as the relationship lacks a strong theoretical foundation. “While a lag between money supply growth and Bitcoin’s price action may exist, there is no strong theoretical basis for why this should consistently be 13 weeks — the timeframe that currently offers the best visual correlation.” Matrixport You might also like: Bitcoin faces 70% odds of another drop as April tariff fears shake markets, Nansen says The analysts also warned that comparing Bitcoin’s price with global liquidity could be misleading as both time series “are non-stationary — they trend over time — which can distort correlation analysis and lead to spurious results.” Now, without a clear catalyst, Bitcoin’s price could continue moving sideways, Matrixport suggested, adding that apart from events like last year’s U.S. presidential election, the cryptocurrency has mostly traded sideways. While some traders still see liquidity trends as a key indicator, the analysts argue that crypto-native factors or macroeconomic policies may still be more useful.

At this point, while creditors were still waiting for payment, there was a new development on the Terra front. Terraform Labs (TFL), the company behind the collapsed stablecoin TerraUSD, announced in a statement that it will open a portal for creditors to file damages claims. Accordingly, Terraform Labs announced that the Crypto Loss Claims Portal will open on Monday, March 31, 2025. Terraform Labs has notified its creditors that filings for crypto loss claims through X can be made until April 30, 2025, at 11:59 PM ET. “Claims submitted after this date will not be accepted and creditors who do not submit a claim before this date will lose their potential rights to compensation.” Creditors wishing to make a claim must register on the portal, provide proof of ownership such as a wallet address or API key for the query, and complete the claim form. Within 90 days of the claim deadline, creditors will receive feedback on the portal regarding the claim amount or the need for further review. Creditors may accept or object to the decision or notice sent to them. Uncontested claims will be eligible for pro rata payments as soon as possible. Terraform Labs has received court approval to begin liquidating under a bankruptcy plan after settling with the SEC last month.

42523452,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144244,1743156025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crucial Insights: CZ Argues Token Prices Should Focus on Development, Not Listings",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cz-token-prices-development-listings/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye, understanding the underlying factors that drive token prices is paramount. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the influential former CEO of crypto giant Binance, recently sparked a vital conversation. He suggests that the true and lasting value of a token shouldn’t hinge on exchange listings, but rather on the fundamental strength of its project’s development. Let’s dive deep into CZ’s perspective and unpack why this viewpoint holds significant weight for anyone navigating the crypto landscape. Why Project Development Should Be the True Driver of Token Prices CZ’s recent statement on X challenges a common perception in the crypto market: the immediate price surge often associated with a new exchange listing. While acknowledging the short-term excitement and increased liquidity that listings bring, CZ emphasizes a more fundamental approach to valuing crypto assets. He posits that genuine, sustainable token prices should be a reflection of the project’s progress, innovation, and real-world utility. Think of it like building a house. A fancy listing on a real estate website might attract initial interest, but the long-term value is determined by the quality of the construction, the materials used, and the location – the actual development of the property. Similarly, in crypto, a token’s price should ideally mirror the robustness of its underlying technology, the strength of its community, and its tangible applications. Here’s a breakdown of why focusing on project development is crucial for sustainable token valuation: Long-Term Value Creation: Projects that are actively developing, innovating, and expanding their use cases are more likely to generate long-term value for token holders. This value is built on tangible progress, not just hype. Reduced Volatility: Tokens driven by solid development are less susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes fueled by listing announcements. Their price is grounded in real progress, offering more stability. Investor Confidence: A project with consistent development activity signals commitment and vision, fostering greater investor confidence and attracting long-term holders. Ecosystem Growth: Development fuels the growth of the entire ecosystem around the token. New features, partnerships, and integrations enhance the token’s utility and appeal. The Role of Crypto Exchange Listings: Liquidity vs. Sustainable Growth Crypto exchange listings are undeniably vital for any token. They provide the essential gateway to liquidity, making it easier for users to buy, sell, and trade the token. A listing on a reputable exchange can indeed boost visibility and accessibility, which can lead to increased demand. However, CZ cautions against overemphasizing the listing itself as the primary price driver. While a listing can cause an immediate price surge due to increased exposure and trading volume, CZ argues that this price action should be viewed as temporary. He believes the market should eventually correct itself to reflect the actual developmental progress of the project. Relying solely on listings for price appreciation can create a speculative bubble, detached from the fundamental value. Let’s consider the benefits and potential drawbacks of focusing too heavily on exchange listings: Benefits of Crypto Exchange Listings Potential Drawbacks of Over-Reliance on Listings Increased Liquidity: Easier to buy and sell tokens. Temporary Price Surges: Price hikes may be unsustainable if not backed by development. Enhanced Visibility: Reaching a wider audience of potential investors. Speculative Bubbles: Listings can fuel hype and speculative trading, leading to price crashes. Simplified Trading: Easier access for traders and investors. Distraction from Fundamentals: Focus shifts from project development to listing announcements. CZ’s perspective urges us to look beyond the initial listing hype and assess the long-term prospects of a token based on its developmental roadmap and execution. Embracing Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): A Paradigm Shift? CZ’s endorsement of the decentralized exchange (DEX) model further reinforces his stance on token valuation. DEXs operate differently from centralized exchanges (CEXs). They generally allow for a much broader range of tokens to be listed, often without the rigorous vetting processes of CEXs. This means that virtually any token can find a trading venue on a DEX. CZ highlights that DEXs empower users by giving them the freedom to decide what to trade. In a DEX environment, the emphasis shifts even more towards the inherent qualities of a token, including its project development , community support, and utility, as opposed to the gatekeeping role of centralized listings. Here’s why CZ’s support for DEXs aligns with his view on token prices: Open Access: DEXs democratize token trading by reducing barriers to entry for new and emerging projects. User Empowerment: Users have more control and autonomy over their trading decisions, choosing tokens based on their own research and evaluation. Focus on Fundamentals: In a DEX environment, tokens must stand on their own merit, driving projects to prioritize development and community building to attract traders. Innovation and Experimentation: DEXs can foster innovation by allowing for the trading of a wider variety of tokens, including those that might not meet the listing criteria of centralized exchanges. However, it’s important to note that the DEX space also comes with its own set of challenges, including potential risks associated with unaudited projects and the complexities of decentralized trading for less experienced users. Actionable Insights: Evaluating Token Prices Beyond the Listing Buzz So, how can investors and crypto enthusiasts apply CZ’s insights to make more informed decisions about token prices ? Here are some actionable steps: Dive into the Whitepaper and Roadmap: Understand the project’s goals, technology, and development plan. Is there a clear vision and a realistic roadmap for achieving it? Assess the Development Team: Research the team behind the project. What is their experience and track record? Are they actively engaged in development and community interaction? Analyze the Community: A strong and active community is a positive sign. Is there genuine interest and engagement, or is it just hype-driven? Evaluate Real-World Utility: Does the token have a practical use case? Is it solving a real problem or providing tangible value? Track Development Activity: Monitor the project’s GitHub repository, blog, and social media for updates on development progress, partnerships, and milestones. Conclusion: A Call for Fundamental Value in Crypto CZ’s message is a powerful reminder that in the exciting and often volatile world of crypto, focusing on fundamental value is crucial for long-term success. While crypto exchange listings play a role in liquidity and accessibility, they shouldn’t be the sole determinant of a token’s worth. True and sustainable token prices are built on the bedrock of consistent project development , innovation, and real-world utility. By shifting our focus to these fundamentals, we can foster a more mature and robust crypto ecosystem, less driven by fleeting hype and more grounded in genuine progress. CZ’s perspective encourages a more discerning and development-focused approach to crypto investing and participation.

This expert take comes amid bullish news around Ripple including the end of the SEC case, and a high chance that regulators will approve a spot ETF soon. Expert Tip on How to Make $12,000% Profit If You Buy XRP at $2.40 Price In a recent post on X, Farina outlined that a trader that buys XRP when the price is at $2.40 can make a 12,000% profit on Ripple in ten years. He noted that if someone who earns an annual salary of $80,000 invests $44,000 into XRP at $2.40, they will receive 18,000 tokens. If this trader makes an informed decision to hold the 18,000 tokens for ten years and Ripple surges to $300 within this time, their investment will be worth a massive $5.4M. In this case, this trader will have made a 12,000% return on investment. “That means, with $3,600 per month for just a year, you secured nearly 69 years of your salary.” Farina’s analysis suggests that XRP may be one of the best altcoins that a trader can hold for substantial gains in the long term. However, can the price reach $300? Can Ripple Price Reach $300 in Ten Years? The $300 target in ten years is a bullish XRP price prediction . However, despite the ongoing turmoil in the market, several factors suggest that this target is easily attainable. The first factor is the newly-found regulatory clarity by Ripple after the SEC dismissed the lawsuit that lasted for five years. Coingape reported that a top analyst believes that the end of this case suggests XRP will dominate Bitcoin and Ethereum. If this happens, XRP price will likely reach $300 in the next decade. Secondly, Nate Geraci believes that with the lawsuit being closed, there is a higher chance that the SEC will approve filings for spot XRP ETFs. This is also poised to bode well for XRP price. Additionally, US President Trump recently launched a digital asset stockpile that includes XRP. This stockpile is also another factor that will likely propel Ripple to $300 in the next years. Lastly, Ripple is obtaining partnerships that may bolster investor confidence in XRP. It recently announced a collaboration with Chipper Cash to promote crypto payments across Africa. Such partnerships are bullish for XRP price. Can XRP Defend the $1.90 Support Level? XRP price trades at $2.23 at press time with a significant 6% dip in 24 hours. This decline is attributed to intense selling activity that has forced the RSI to drop to 24. Nevertheless, an oversold RSI may be good for Ripple. The last time that this indicator dropped to this extreme level, XRP price bounced by more than 50% within a short time from $1.98 to $2.99. If Ripple were to follow this pattern again. It could easily soar to $3.34. XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart However, XRP price is still at risk of falling further after a top analyst warned of a crash to $1. This analyst noted that XRP needs to continue trading above $1.90 to avoid a massive crash. However, if selling pressure surges in the near term and CRP breaches the $1.90 support level, traders should brace for more losses.

The statement, issued on March 28, followed media reports and social media coverage that suggested a partnership had been finalized between LY and Soneium. “These reports were based on an announcement made by Soneium on [March 12] that it plans to expand its business by using the LINE API and LINE Mini Apps on our platform, although no business partnership or the like has been established between Soneium and LY Corporation,” LY said . In response, a Soneium spokesperson told Cointelegraph: “Our March 12 announcement refers to a collaboration, which involves exploring the integration of onchain Mini Apps within the Line ecosystem. We stand by the accuracy of all content published in our official statement. “LY Corporation has also directed readers to our announcement for context and clarification. Additionally, Soneium received permission to reference Line in that announcement, and the Kaia Mini App is not exclusive to any single provider,” the spokesperson added.

Japanese tech titans and their blockchain ventures LY Corporation is a Japanese tech giant formed through the merger of several major entities, including Line — Japan’s largest messaging platform — and Yahoo Japan. The 2023 merger also brought Line’s Web3 arm, Line Next, under the LY umbrella. Line Next was established in late 2021 and raised $140 million in December 2023 from a consortium led by Crescendo Equity Partners. In January, it launched “Mini Dapps,” which offer games and social content within the LINE messenger — echoing the popularity of Telegram’s Mini Apps, which soared in popularity through tap-to-earn games and airdrops. Line’s Mini Dapps are powered by Kaia, a layer-1 blockchain formed by merging Line’s Finschia chain with Kakao’s Klaytn network. On March 6, Line announced that its Mini Dapps had surpassed 35 million users. The top Mini Dapp generated $773,000 during the launch month on Line.

Developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, Soneium launched its mainnet in January with features such as NFTs tied to Amazon Prime Video content. Soneium taps into the global power of Japanese anime On March 28, Soneium announced a separate partnership with Animoca Brands to promote anime culture in Web3. Through the partnership, Animoca’s digital identity platform, Moca Network, will create a decentralized identity layer on Soneium, starting with Anime ID, a reputation-based identifier for anime fans. The move comes amid surging global interest in anime content. In a 2024 media interview , Rahul Purini, president of anime streaming app Crunchyroll, said the platform’s research found 800 million people outside of China and Japan — where Crunchyroll’s library and access are limited — watch anime content.

42523879,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144218,1743156622,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Decoding Asia FX: Yen Surges on Tokyo CPI Triumph, Aussie Dollar Tumbles on RBA Rate Pause",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-yen-aussie-dollar-2/,"Navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency often requires a keen eye on broader economic trends, and the foreign exchange (Forex) market provides crucial insights. Recently, Asia FX markets have presented a mixed bag of signals, with the Japanese Yen (JPY) exhibiting surprising strength while the Australian Dollar (AUD) faced headwinds. What’s behind these divergent paths and what does it mean for crypto traders keeping a pulse on global finance? Let’s dive deep into the latest Forex developments in Asia and uncover the key factors at play. Why is the Japanese Yen (JPY) Surging? The Tokyo CPI Effect The Japanese Yen has emerged as a standout performer in Asia FX markets , buoyed by unexpectedly robust inflation data from Tokyo. But what exactly is the Tokyo CPI, and why does it matter so much? Understanding Tokyo CPI: The Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator of inflation in Japan’s capital city. It’s often seen as a leading indicator for nationwide inflation trends. A higher-than-expected Tokyo CPI suggests that inflationary pressures are building in Japan. Strong CPI Data: Recent Tokyo CPI figures have exceeded expectations, signaling a potential shift in Japan’s long-standing battle with deflation. This positive inflation surprise has boosted expectations that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) might consider adjusting its ultra-loose monetary policy sooner than anticipated. Impact on the Yen: Higher inflation and the prospect of a less dovish BOJ typically lead to a stronger Yen. Traders anticipate that the BOJ might reduce stimulus or even raise interest rates to combat inflation, making the Yen more attractive to investors seeking yield. Safe-Haven Appeal: Beyond inflation data, the Yen also benefits from its traditional safe-haven status. In times of global economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often flock to the Yen, driving up its value. In essence, the strong Tokyo CPI has acted as a powerful catalyst, reigniting interest in the Japanese Yen and positioning it as a leading currency within Asia FX markets . Australian Dollar (AUD) Under Pressure: RBA Rate Hold Bets While the Yen is riding high, the Australian Dollar (AUD) is facing downward pressure. The primary culprit? Growing expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will maintain its current interest rate policy, opting for a rate hold. Let’s break down the factors impacting the Aussie Dollar: RBA Rate Decision Speculation: Market participants are closely watching the RBA for signals about future interest rate moves. Recent economic data and commentary have led to increased bets that the RBA will hold rates steady in the near term. Global Economic Concerns: The Australian Dollar , being a commodity-linked currency, is sensitive to global economic sentiment. Concerns about slowing global growth, particularly in China (a major trading partner for Australia), can weigh on the AUD. Divergence with Yen: The contrasting monetary policy outlooks between the BOJ and RBA are creating a divergence in the Yen and Australian Dollar . As the Yen gains strength on BOJ expectations, the Aussie Dollar weakens on RBA rate hold predictions. Commodity Price Fluctuations: While Australia is a major commodity exporter, fluctuations in commodity prices can also impact the AUD. Uncertainty in commodity markets can add to the pressure on the Australian Dollar . Therefore, the anticipation of a steady RBA rate decision , coupled with global economic uncertainties, is contributing to the Australian Dollar’s softer performance in Asia FX markets . Asia FX Markets: A Mixed Landscape – What Does It Mean for You? The contrasting fortunes of the Yen and Australian Dollar highlight the mixed nature of Asia FX markets right now. But what are the broader implications, especially for those involved in the cryptocurrency space? Key Takeaways from Asia FX Market Movements Currency Driving Factor Market Sentiment Potential Crypto Impact Japanese Yen (JPY) Strong Tokyo CPI, BOJ Policy Expectations Bullish Yen strength can sometimes correlate with risk-off sentiment, potentially influencing crypto flows. Australian Dollar (AUD) RBA Rate Hold Bets, Global Growth Concerns Bearish A weaker Aussie Dollar reflects broader risk aversion, which can also impact crypto markets. Overall Asia FX Mixed Economic Signals, Divergent Central Bank Policies Cautious Increased volatility and uncertainty in traditional markets can sometimes drive interest towards alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders, monitoring Asia FX markets provides valuable context. Here’s how these Forex movements can be relevant: Risk Sentiment Gauge: Forex markets, particularly major pairs like USD/JPY and AUD/USD, can serve as a barometer for global risk sentiment. Yen strength often signals risk aversion, while Aussie Dollar weakness can also reflect similar concerns. This sentiment can spill over into crypto markets. Macroeconomic Backdrop: Understanding the macroeconomic factors driving Forex movements – such as inflation (Tokyo CPI) and central bank policies (RBA rate decision) – helps in assessing the broader economic environment that influences all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Trading Opportunities: Volatility in Asia FX markets can create trading opportunities, not just in Forex but also potentially in crypto markets. Correlations between Forex and crypto can sometimes emerge, offering avenues for informed trading strategies. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead in the Forex and Crypto Game So, how can you leverage this understanding of Asia FX markets to enhance your trading or investment decisions? Monitor Economic Data: Keep an eye on key economic releases like CPI data (especially Tokyo CPI for Yen) and employment figures. These data points can significantly influence Forex movements and indirectly impact crypto sentiment. Track Central Bank Policies: Stay informed about central bank announcements and policy statements, particularly from the BOJ and RBA. Rate decisions and forward guidance can be major catalysts for currency fluctuations. Analyze Forex Charts: Incorporate Forex charts (e.g., USD/JPY, AUD/USD) into your market analysis. Look for trends, patterns, and potential correlations with cryptocurrency price movements. Diversify Your Information Sources: Don’t rely solely on crypto-specific news. Broaden your horizons to include Forex market analysis and global economic news to gain a more holistic view of market dynamics. Conclusion: Navigating the Forex Currents to Understand Crypto Tides The Asia FX markets are currently presenting a fascinating picture of divergence and uncertainty. The Yen’s unexpected surge on strong Tokyo CPI data contrasts sharply with the Australian Dollar’s slip amid RBA rate decision anticipation. Understanding these Forex dynamics provides valuable context for navigating the cryptocurrency landscape. By keeping a close watch on global economic trends and inter-market relationships, you can enhance your market awareness and make more informed decisions in the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

ETH had a deeper crash than Bitcoin (BTC), which only took a step back to $86,000. Ethereum (ETH) crashed again, sinking under $2,000 after a general market downturn. The token has not achieved the promised breakout, and trades at 0.022 BTC. In fiat terms, ETH traded at $1,917.21, close to its three-month lower range. Ethereum (ETH) trades near a three-month low, though there are signs whales are accumulating at levels under $2,000. | Source: CoinGecko ETH sentiment remains neutral, and open interest has fallen to $9.9B. Derivative traders have built up liquidity at the $2,040 and $2,100 levels, but ETH may dip as low as the $1,800 range to liquidate long positions, before returning for a short squeeze. Whales accumulate ETH under $2,000 Despite the market drawdown, ETH is still inviting whales to buy the dip. The token is still required for DeFi, trading and other utility purposes, or as collateral in DeFi lending. ETH remains at a crossroads, with 45% of holders in the money, 51% holding unrealized losses, and a small neutral sub-section. Narratives for ETH are conflicting, with some talk of the token becoming obsolete or falling to a lower range. However, recent whale accumulation shows the token is at least considered capable of a relief rally. Individual whales are also taking ETH off exchanges, as in the case of one buyer acquiring $108M in ETH. An earlier example shows a whale buying up ETH from retail traders in multiple orders for the last quarter. While ETH is not immediately scarce, whales are accumulating easily accessible coins for trading and short-term profit-taking. Holding ETH in a self-controlled wallet still has utility, such as staking, lending, or providing liquidity. ETH also sees selling pressure from hackers ETH remains the token most widely used to park proceeds from hacks and exploits. Some of the ETH from the Bybit exploit may still be laundered through decentralized services. Recently, two addresses received 14,064 ETH from THORChain and CoinFlip. They quickly traded the tokens for over $27M in DAI, at a price of $1,956 per ETH. One of the addresses continues to receive ETH from THORChain, as the origin of funds remains unknown. Hacker traders are extremely aggressive, using decentralized liquidity pools with little regard for fees or price slippage. Unlike trader whales, hackers use the first suitable moment to sell and move funds. Ethereum fees remain near all-time lows Ethereum fees are still near all-time lows, signaling low demand for the network’s services. Average transactions are as low as $0.02, as only a few services are widely used. A big part of gas on Ethereum goes to stablecoin transfers, as well as the Uniswap Universal Router. General ETH transfers and USDT movements burn around 58 ETH per day from fees, and they are the two most significant activities on the network. Other types of swaps, bridging or NFTs minting have slowed down, as fewer projects organize airdrops with point farming. Decentralized swaps have fallen to a price of $0.28, DeFi borrowing fees are at $0.23, and bridging is down to $0.09. Despite this, network activity has slowed down significantly and retail users are not returning. The Ethereum network carries 310K daily active wallets, a level not seen since September 2024. At the same time, more addresses are receiving ETH , showing a spike to over 203K wallets. As a result of lowered activity, Ethereum inflation continues to rise, breaking out to 0.80% for the first time in months. Low but persistent inflation means the network now produces 948K additional ETH in a year, an inflow that may continue to depress the price and shift the token to a lower range.

Price Crash Below $6.7 Signals Bigger Problems,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/uniswap/uniswap-crash-below-6-7/,"Uniswap (UNI) has slipped below the crucial $6.7 support level, raising concerns about a potential extended downturn. This breakdown comes amid increasing selling pressure, signaling that the bulls may be losing their grip on the market. With volatility rising and market uncertainty growing, the next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether UNI can bounce back or if a prolonged downtrend is on the horizon. Will the bulls reclaim lost ground, or is UNI heading for even lower levels? Price Action and Technical Indicators Flash Warning Signs UNI’s price action is showing clear signs of weakness as the token struggles to regain momentum after breaking below the $6.7 support level. The recent downturn has intensified bearish sentiment, with sellers dominating the market and pushing UNI toward lower support levels. If buying pressure doesn’t return soon, further losses could be imminent. Related Reading: Uniswap Bleeds 20%—Is This Whale Behind The Drop? The asset has dropped below its 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key long-term support level. This breakdown suggests a potential shift toward a broader downtrend, especially if UNI fails to reclaim this level quickly. A prolonged stay below the 100-day SMA could reinforce seller dominance, increasing the risk of further declines. Meanwhile, the MACD has flipped bearish, with the signal line crossing below the MACD line, a classic indication that sellers are gaining strength. Additionally, Uniswap trading volume has declined, suggesting a lack of strong bullish participation to counteract the selloff. For Uniswap to regain strength, buyers must push the price back above $6.7 with strong volume, invalidating the breakdown. Until then, the risk of more downside toward $5.5 and $4.8 remains high. Can Uniswap Reclaim $6.7 and Reverse Course? Uniswap is at a critical inflection point after its recent breakdown below $6.70. As UNI struggles to regain momentum, traders and investors are left wondering whether this drop is just a temporary setback or the start of a deeper correction. Related Reading: Uniswap Stays On Course For More Gains – $12.3 Resistance In Sight While bears have dominated recent price action, the market questions whether UNI can fight its way back above this key level or if the resistance will hold. If UNI manages to break and hold above $6.7 with robust buying volume, it could indicate that bullish momentum is returning, invalidating recent bearish pressure and signaling a potential trend reversal. A decisive breakout above this level would restore investor confidence and also attract more buyers, leading to an extended rally. Should this scenario unfold, UNI might gain traction toward $8.7, with a sustained push driving the price to $10.3 and beyond in the coming weeks.

According to Dark Web Informer, a cyber-focused news outlet, hackers operating under the alias AKM69 are offering 100,000 Gemini user records for sale. The database reportedly contains full names, emails, phone numbers, and location data of individuals, primarily from the United States, with some entries linked to Singapore and the UK. The hacker claims the data is part of a broader campaign aimed at exploiting crypto users for fraud, marketing scams, or account recovery targeting. A day prior, another dark web seller, going by the handle kiki88888, listed a batch of Binance emails and passwords for sale. The compromised dataset allegedly contains 132,744 lines of sensitive information. Binance Denies Internal Data Breach In response to the reports, Binance clarified that the leaked data did not stem from a breach of the exchange itself. Instead, the company attributed the incident to malware-infected computers, where hackers gained access by compromising browser sessions. Dark Web Informer echoed this explanation , hinting that the data leak stemmed from user negligence rather than exchange vulnerabilities. The platform cheekily added, “Some of you really need to stop clicking random stuff.” This isn’t the first time Binance has been linked to a potential data leak. In September 2024, a hacker named FireBear claimed to have stolen a database containing 12.8 million Binance user records, including names, emails, phone numbers, and residential addresses. However, Binance dismissed the claim as false following an internal investigation. Crypto Users Increasingly Targeted by Scams The latest dark web listings underscore the rising cyber threats facing crypto users. Just last week, Australian federal police revealed they had warned 130 individuals about a phishing scam impersonating Binance . The scam, which used a spoofed sender ID, attempted to lure users into revealing their credentials. On March 14, several X users reported receiving fraudulent messages mimicking Coinbase and Gemini, urging them to create new wallets with pre-generated recovery phrases controlled by hackers. As hackers grow increasingly sophisticated, experts warn that even seemingly minor leaks can become entry points for large-scale fraud.

Despite this surge, the crypto asset quickly retraced, falling by 3% over the past 24 hours, as traders appear to have cashed in on the brief relief rally. However, BTC flows across all exchanges suggest that a strong rally may come to fruition soon. Bitcoin Withdrawals on the Rise CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , focusing on the total Bitcoin inflow and outflow from exchanges, indicates a massive upside potential for the largest crypto asset. If the total flow is positive, it generally signals a bearish trend due to increased selling pressure. On the other hand, negative flow suggests a bullish outlook, as more Bitcoin is withdrawn from exchanges, which implies investor confidence and expectations of a price increase. The analysis shows that since February 6 of this year, there has been a significant increase in Bitcoin withdrawals across exchanges. Historically, such outflows have been associated with rising asset prices, which, in turn, signal that investors are accumulating and transferring their holdings to cold wallets in anticipation of future gains. This trend indicates a growing sense of market confidence, which could mean that a price rally may be on the horizon. Additionally, the analysis highlights the relationship between Bitcoin inflows, outflows, and net flow. Higher inflows indicate increased selling pressure, while higher outflows reflect investor confidence and are typically bullish for the price. With recent data showing a large negative net flow, there is speculation that the asset’s price could experience upward volatility in the near future. If these trends continue, the market may see a major shift in favor of buyers, thereby resulting in a potential rally. Strong Intitutional Demand On the institutional side of things, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US extended their positive flow streak to 10 consecutive days on Thursday. This represented the longest inflow run since December. According to SoSoValue data , these investment vehicles saw a total daily net inflow of $89 million on that day. Fidelity’s FBTC dominated the figures, contributing $97.14 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT also saw nearly $4 million in inflows. However, Invesco’s BTCO experienced an outflow of nearly $7 million, and WisdomTree’s BTCW saw $5 million exit the fund.

According to Angry Crypto Show , Hoskinson revealed that discussions have been taking place with Ripple regarding the potential integration of RLUSD , Ripple’s stablecoin, onto the Cardano blockchain. This revelation has sparked excitement among both Cardano and XRP communities, as it hints at a possible collaboration between two major players in the cryptocurrency space. JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""we've been talking to Ripple about getting $RLUSD on Cardano."" pic.twitter.com/2hNCuFUgyW — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) March 27, 2025 A Potential Game-Changer for Cardano Hoskinson’s statement is significant because it suggests that Cardano is actively seeking to expand its ecosystem by incorporating new assets. RLUSD, which is expected to play a crucial role in Ripple’s growing financial infrastructure, could bring increased liquidity and adoption to the Cardano network. While no official confirmation has been made regarding a finalized agreement, the fact that discussions are taking place is a positive indication of cross-chain collaboration in the crypto industry. Cardano has long been regarded as a blockchain that prioritizes research-driven development and meticulous planning. The potential addition of RLUSD would mark an important milestone in the project’s evolution, particularly as Cardano continues to expand its DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem. Given Ripple’s vast experience in financial technology and its extensive network of institutional partners, this integration could help Cardano attract more developers, users, and liquidity providers. Why RLUSD on Cardano Matters Stablecoins play a vital role in modern blockchain economies by offering a bridge between traditional finance and crypto markets. RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, is designed to provide a reliable store of value and facilitate efficient transactions. If integrated into the Cardano ecosystem, it could bring several benefits: Increased Liquidity: RLUSD could enhance the depth of Cardano’s DeFi markets, making it easier for users to trade and engage in lending or borrowing activities. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cross-Chain Utility: A partnership with Ripple could open the door to further interoperability between Cardano and the XRP Ledger, allowing assets to move seamlessly between the two blockchains. Adoption and Institutional Interest: Ripple has established relationships with financial institutions worldwide. If RLUSD becomes a widely used asset on Cardano, it could increase institutional adoption of the platform. Ripple’s Expanding Influence in the Crypto Space Ripple has been actively working on expanding its ecosystem, with RLUSD being a key part of its broader strategy. The company has focused on improving payment infrastructure through blockchain technology, and stablecoins like RLUSD are expected to enhance the efficiency of global transactions. While Ripple has traditionally been associated with cross-border payments, its recent moves indicate a push into DeFi and stablecoin markets, making the prospect of integration with Cardano even more intriguing. What Comes Next? While Hoskinson’s statement suggests that discussions are ongoing, it remains to be seen whether RLUSD will officially launch on Cardano. If collaboration is finalized, it could mark a significant step toward bridging the XRP and Cardano ecosystems, further solidifying both projects’ relevance in the blockchain space. For now, investors and crypto enthusiasts will be watching closely for any official announcements from Ripple or Cardano. Whether this partnership materializes or not, it is clear that Cardano is positioning itself as a serious player in the evolving world of blockchain finance.

TON trades at a key zone of $4, with an inverse head & shoulders breakout hinting at continued rallies. Chart by CoinMarketCap The pattern surfaced in Feb 2025 after TON plummeted to the $2.30 low. The setup emerged with a neckline resistance around the $3.88 mark. TON trades above the obstacle, a breakout that coincided with increased 24-hour trading volumes. Bullish technical and on-chain data show that Toncoin will confirm the breakout. The inverse head & shoulders pattern targets $6.16, which would mean a 54% uptick from Toncoin’s current price. However, intensified selling activities in the broad crypto space could delay TON’s anticipated surge.

According to a report in the Khaleej Times, Central Bank of the UAE Governor Khaled Mohamed Balama reportedly said that the blockchain-based currency could improve financial stability and help combat financial crime. According to the report, the retail sector could expect the issuance of a digital dirham in the last quarter of 2025. “It [digital dirham] will further enable the development of innovative digital products, services, and new business models while reducing cost and increasing access to international markets,” Balama reportedly said. The report also stated that the digital dirham and its physical counterpart will be accepted as a payment method in all payment channels. The news comes as the digital dirham received a rebrand. The first letter of the dirham will be its international symbol, along with two horizontal lines representing the currency’s stability, inspired by the UAE flag. The new symbol for UAE dirhams. Source: Khaleej Times The road to digital dirhams in the UAE In June 2024, the CBUAE approved a licensing framework for regulating stablecoins. In a meeting with the CBUAE board of directors in Abu Dhabi, UAE officials discussed the government’s financial infrastructure program and approved the framework. The new rules clarified the issuance, licensing and supervision of payment tokens backed by the UAE dirham. Following the framework’s approval, stablecoin issuer Tether announced its plans to launch a dirham-backed stablecoin with local partners Phoenix Group and Green Acorn Investments. The collaboration aims to establish a fully-backed digital representation of the UAE dirham currency. After the framework approval, other players joined the race to create a dirham-backed stablecoin. On Oct. 18, 2024, a company called AED Stablecoin received in-principle approval for issuing a regulated dirham-pegged stablecoin in the UAE. On Nov. 1, The Open Network (TON) announced that Tether’s dirham-pegged stablecoin will be launched on its blockchain network . Related: Abu Dhabi’s financial free zone signs MoU with Chainlink for tokenization frameworks Stablecoins in the UAE Apart from dirham-backed stablecoins, US dollar and euro stablecoins have also gained traction in the country. On Feb. 24, the Dubai Financial Services Authority, the independent regulator for the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), recognized Circle’s USDC and EURC as the first stablecoins under its crypto token regime. Meanwhile, a Ripple spokesperson previously told Cointelegraph that the company is working to understand the country’s stablecoin requirements. The spokesperson said they are monitoring the developments closely and that their RLUSD stablecoin is available in the UAE.

Global commerce is expanding rapidly while the traditional payment systems remain outdated, expensive, and slow. Both companies and individuals struggle with high transaction fees and long settlements, and some even have very limited access to the banking systems. You might also like: Stablecoins are inevitable but can’t scale without a truly private digital dollar | Opinion People and businesses have been relying on outdated and inefficient systems for transferring money across borders for decades before the emergence of cryptocurrencies, specifically stablecoins. The main problems with traditional banking and financial service providers are payment delays, high fees, and liquidity shortages. Luckily, stablecoins and on-chain liquidity providers are addressing the issues by offering up-to-date, real-time, and low-cost transactions. Traditional payments are failing businesses From merchants in Africa to freelancers in Southeast Asia to businesses in Latin America, individuals and companies have been suffering from delays, high fees, and liquidity issues in cross-border payments. For example, using SWIFT, the global messaging network for financial transactions, has faced strong criticism for its inefficiency in global payments. While 66% of the SWIFT transactions arrive within 24 hours, it usually takes one to three business days for the funds that don’t need manual confirmation to be transferred in normal conditions—some transactions could take up to one month if they involve manual checks. Let’s not forget the transaction fees that come with using SWIFT—sending fees, receiving fees, intermediary bank fees, and sometimes, foreign exchange fees. Some of the main reasons behind the inefficiency of SWIFT transactions are compliance checks, incorrect payment details, and the involvement of multiple intermediary banks, to name a few. Traditional fintech isn’t enough The rise of digital payment platforms like Wise, PayPal, and Stripe has improved accessibility for many individuals and businesses in developed countries, but they still depend on traditional financial networks. The problems with traditional payment systems come as the demand has been constantly rising. The global cross-border settlements reached $190.1 trillion in value in 2023, and the number is expected to surpass $290 trillion by 2030, according to a Foley report last August. For every cross-border transaction to successfully reach its destination, it would have to go through multiple layers of processing and intermediaries—each layer adds fees and potential delays to the payments. A business in Nigeria that receives payments from Europe, for instance, would normally need to convert its funds multiple times—from euro to US dollar to naira—before cashing out from a local bank. This will cost the business with extra fees. This suggests a need for a payment system that eliminates these friction points. Both businesses and individuals need to access real-time transactions and liquidity. That’s why stablecoins, like Tether ( USDT ), and on-chain liquidity providers, like MANSA, have been seeing impressive growth over the last few years. Real solution: Stablecoins and on-chain liquidity Unlike the traditional banking system, stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat asset like the US dollar—operate 24/7 without any middlemen, all thanks to the characteristics of blockchain technology—decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Stablecoins have seen remarkable growth over the last five years. For instance, USDT’s market capitalization skyrocketed from $4.6 billion in March 2020 to over $142 billion so far—the total stablecoin market cap surpassed $230 billion. This development shows the strong utility of the asset class in facilitating efficient transactions. However, to facilitate transactions seamlessly, stablecoins need liquidity. Digital payment infrastructure builders like MANSA are developing solutions to allow fast and flawless transactions across the world by providing on-chain liquidity. The key to enabling instant and transparent transactions, without any third parties like banks or payment networks, is by leveraging stablecoins and on-chain liquidity. The Nigerian business example would look different with stablecoins. The supplier from Nigeria can receive USDT from the buyer in Europe and instantly convert the funds into the local naira using MANSA’s on-chain liquidity pools. This way, the business owner wouldn’t need to pay the multi-layer fees and reduce the transaction delays to a minimum. Stablecoins and on-chain liquidity providers are already eliminating delays and transaction costs—the main issues that traditional finance has failed to achieve. Underserved markets are the biggest winners The real winners of stablecoin adoption are the underserved regions like Africa and Latin America. The net crypto imports of Brazil reached $12.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024, showing a 60.7% increase from the year before, according to a Reuters report . Notably, stablecoins accounted for nearly 70% of all crypto transactions in the country in 2024. The growth of USDT remittances and crypto-to-fiat on-ramps in emerging markets is proof that users prefer stable, on-chain payments over traditional banking rails. Regulators and policymakers should view stablecoins and on-chain liquidity as the solution since they reduce the systemic friction in payments, bank the underserved, and are more efficient for remittances. Stablecoins and the future of global payments Despite their growing adoption, stablecoins and on-chain liquidity providers are not here to replace traditional financial institutions—they are here to improve them. The future of payments is about flexibility, speed, and accessibility. Financial institutions, payment services, and businesses are already integrating stablecoins into their payment flows. Last year, Wise became the first foreign company to gain access to Japan’s bank payment clearing network, Zengin. This allowed the company to significantly reduce cross-border transaction fees by eliminating the intermediary banks. The shift from traditional finance to stablecoins is not speculative—it’s happening now as the demand for transparent, low-cost, and seamless global transactions increases. The rise of on-chain liquidity would potentially decline the reliance on outdated banking systems.

Investors who've long relied on BTC as the gold widespread of digital assets are actually wondering about its short-term stability. Meanwhile, AI-driven cryptocurrencies like Ozak AI (OZ) are emerging as a compelling alternative, supplying high-boom capability, real-world utility, and advanced AI integration. With Bitcoin showing signs and weak momentum, may Ozak AI be the next investor favorite? Let’s explore why this AI-powered challenge is attracting interest while BTC struggles. Bitcoin’s Decline Raises Investor Concerns Bitcoin’s recent price drop is attributed to a mix of macro-economic pressures, regulatory concerns, and market-wide corrections. Some of the key elements affecting BTC encompass: Regulatory Uncertainty – Governments and financial institutions maintain strict guidelines and potential tax implications on Bitcoin, decreasing self assurance among retail and institutional buyers. FOMC and Interest Rates – The Federal Reserve’s financial guidelines and ability interest price hikes have slowed down risk-on asset investments, consisting of Bitcoin. Decreasing Market Dominance – While Bitcoin remains the biggest cryptocurrency, altcoins, AI tokens, and DeFi initiatives are capturing a bigger proportion of investor interest. With BTC’s price action looking susceptible within the short time period, many traders are diversifying into rising crypto tasks with greater upside ability—and Ozak AI is quickly turning into a top desire. Why Ozak AI Could Be the Next Big Crypto Play Unlike Bitcoin, which typically serves as a store of value, Ozak AI is a utility-driven AI blockchain project that mixes artificial intelligence, decentralized finance (DeFi), and predictive analytics to provide real-world solutions. Here’s why investors are taking notice: AI-Driven Innovation – Ozak AI leverages machine learning and AI algorithms to optimize crypto trading, automate DeFi techniques, and enhance blockchain analytics. Massive Growth Potential – Analysts expect AI-focused cryptocurrencies will outperform traditional digital belongings, with some projects seeing 300x–500x returns. Early Investment Advantage – Ozak AI is still in its presale phase, that means traders can buy in before major exchange listings drive up demand and price. Real-World Utility – Unlike meme coins or speculative tokens, Ozak AI offers realistic AI applications that provide it long-term sustainability and adoption potential. With Bitcoin’s increase slowing down, AI-powered blockchain solutions like Ozak AI offer a fresh, high-reward opportunity for investors in search of more potent gains. Moreover, the 3rd stage of the Ozak AI presale is currently occurring, and the task is already making waves within the crypto community. With an outstanding over $900K raised so far, Ozak AI tokens are currently priced at simply $0.003 each, with the next level price set at $0.005. This early-level opportunity is poised for sizable growth, with projections suggesting that the token ought to reach $1 by 2025. Bitcoin vs. AI Cryptos—Where Should Investors Focus? While Bitcoin remains the leading crypto asset, its price fluctuations and market saturation are making it much less appealing to risk-tolerant investors. AI-driven cryptos like Ozak AI offer a possibility to get in early on a game-changing innovation earlier than the wider market catches on. A $5,000 funding in Bitcoin might yield modest gains over the years, but the identical quantity invested in Ozak AI throughout its early stages may want to multiply exponentially if it reaches its projected valuation. For traders seeking out the following foremost crypto success tale, Ozak AI is rising as a top mission within the AI-powered blockchain revolution.

42526906,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144189,1743162053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Relief for Crypto.com: SEC Ends Probe in Favorable Turn for Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-ends-crypto-probe/,"In a significant win for the cryptocurrency industry, and particularly for the popular exchange Crypto.com, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly concluded its investigation into Crypto.com without pursuing any enforcement actions. This news, first reported by Eleanor Terrett of Crypto In America on X, citing sources familiar with the matter, marks a pivotal moment amidst ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. Let’s delve into what this means for Crypto.com, the broader implications for crypto regulation US , and what could be on the horizon. Crypto.com SEC Probe Ends: What Does This Mean? The news that the Crypto.com SEC probe has concluded without any charges is undoubtedly a positive development for the platform and its users. Here’s a breakdown of the key events leading up to this outcome: Wells Notice Received: Back in October, Crypto.com received a Wells notice from the SEC. A Wells notice is essentially a notification that the SEC is planning to recommend enforcement action against the recipient. This can be a worrying sign for any company, especially in the heavily regulated financial sector. Preemptive Lawsuit: In a bold move, Crypto.com decided to take the offensive. They preemptively sued the SEC, arguing that the regulator was overstepping its authority. This was an unusual step, signaling a strong stance against the SEC’s scrutiny. Lawsuit Dropped: Interestingly, Crypto.com dropped the lawsuit in December. This coincided with President Donald Trump’s announcement of Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, as his pick for SEC chair. This timing suggests a potential shift in strategy or perhaps a signal of behind-the-scenes developments. Investigation Concluded: Now, months later, the news breaks that the SEC has indeed ended its SEC investigation crypto without taking any enforcement action. This indicates that after their inquiry, the SEC did not find sufficient grounds to pursue charges against Crypto.com. This conclusion offers a sense of relief to Crypto.com and could be interpreted as a validation of their operational practices. It also raises questions about the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation and whether this could signal a change in their enforcement strategy. Why is SEC Crypto Regulation So Critical? The role of the SEC in regulating the cryptocurrency industry is a topic of intense debate and scrutiny. Understanding why SEC crypto regulation is considered so important is crucial to grasping the significance of this development. Here are some key reasons: Aspect Importance of SEC Regulation Investor Protection The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors. In the volatile crypto market, this is paramount. Regulation aims to prevent fraud, market manipulation, and ensure fair practices, safeguarding individuals and institutions investing in digital assets. Market Integrity Regulation fosters trust and integrity in the crypto market. Clear rules and oversight can help establish a level playing field, encourage institutional adoption, and reduce the risks associated with unregulated markets. Compliance and Legitimacy Regulatory frameworks provide guidelines for crypto businesses to operate legally and compliantly. This legitimacy is essential for the long-term growth and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Financial Stability As the crypto market becomes increasingly interconnected with traditional finance, regulators like the SEC are concerned about potential systemic risks. Regulation aims to mitigate these risks and maintain overall financial stability. However, the debate often revolves around finding the right balance between regulation and innovation. Overly strict or unclear regulations can stifle growth and push innovation overseas. The crypto industry often argues for clearer guidelines and a more collaborative approach from regulators. Crypto Compliance: A Victory and a Continuing Journey For Crypto.com, the end of the SEC probe without enforcement action can be seen as a significant win in their crypto compliance journey. It suggests that their efforts to adhere to regulatory standards, even amidst uncertainty, have been effective. But what are the broader takeaways regarding compliance in the crypto world? Proactive Compliance is Key: Crypto.com’s proactive approach, even considering the preemptive lawsuit (though later dropped), demonstrates the importance of taking compliance seriously from the outset. Engaging with regulators and demonstrating a commitment to legal frameworks is crucial. Navigating Regulatory Uncertainty: The crypto regulatory landscape is still evolving. Companies must be prepared to navigate ambiguity and adapt to changing rules. This requires robust legal and compliance teams, and a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue with regulatory bodies. Reputational Boost: Successfully navigating a regulatory investigation and emerging without enforcement action can significantly enhance a company’s reputation. It signals to users, investors, and partners that the platform is operating responsibly and transparently. Ongoing Scrutiny: While this particular probe has ended, it’s unlikely to be the end of regulatory scrutiny for Crypto.com or the crypto industry as a whole. Crypto compliance news is a constantly evolving space, and continuous vigilance and adaptation are essential. US Crypto Regulation Landscape: What’s Next? The conclusion of the Crypto.com probe occurs within a larger context of evolving US crypto regulation . The appointment of a crypto-friendly SEC chair, as suggested by the mention of Paul Atkins, could potentially signal a shift in the regulatory approach. What might we expect to see in the near future? Increased Clarity: The crypto industry has long called for clearer regulatory guidelines. A more crypto-friendly leadership at the SEC could lead to the development of more specific and practical rules for digital asset businesses. Balanced Approach: A shift could mean a move towards a more balanced approach, one that encourages innovation while still protecting investors and maintaining market integrity. This might involve more collaboration with the industry and a focus on fostering responsible growth. Continued Enforcement: It’s important to note that even with a potentially more favorable regulatory environment, enforcement will likely remain a key aspect of the SEC’s role. Areas like fraud, market manipulation, and unregistered securities offerings will continue to be targets of regulatory action. Global Harmonization: The US regulatory landscape is also influenced by global trends. Efforts towards international harmonization of crypto regulations could become more prominent, aiming to create a more consistent and predictable global market. Navigating Crypto Investigation: Key Insights For crypto companies, the Crypto.com situation offers valuable lessons on how to navigate potential regulatory investigations. While each case is unique, here are some actionable insights: Build a Strong Compliance Framework: Invest in robust compliance programs from the outset. This includes KYC/AML procedures, security measures, and legal expertise. Engage with Regulators: Maintain open communication with regulatory bodies. Seek clarification on rules and be proactive in addressing any concerns. Seek Expert Legal Counsel: Engage experienced legal counsel specializing in crypto regulation. They can provide guidance, navigate investigations, and represent your interests effectively. Transparency is Crucial: Operate with transparency and be prepared to provide information to regulators when requested. Be Prepared for Scrutiny: Regulatory scrutiny is a reality in the crypto space. Be prepared for potential investigations and develop a plan for how to respond. In conclusion, the SEC’s decision to end its probe into Crypto.com without enforcement is a welcome sign for the company and the broader crypto market. It underscores the ongoing evolution of crypto regulation and the importance of proactive compliance. While the regulatory landscape remains dynamic, this development offers a glimmer of optimism and suggests a potentially more balanced approach to overseeing the burgeoning digital asset industry. The journey of crypto investigation and compliance is far from over, but this episode provides valuable lessons and a sense of cautious optimism for the future.

Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 242,800 followers on the social media platform X that Sonic ( S ) may be on the verge of breaking out after bouncing off of the 25-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Traders look at the EMA to determine whether an asset’s price is in an uptrend or not. If the price remains above the EMA, then the asset is likely going to remain bullish. However, he warns that an S uptrend may depend on whether Bitcoin ( BTC ) stays trading around its current price level. Bitcoin is trading for $87,300 at time of writing. “I still think that S is a pretty good buy around these levels. I think this legs up as long as BTC is stable. Still a lot of activity on this chain and a bunch of things going for it.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Sonic is trading for $0.60 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the trader says that the artificial intelligence (AI)-based meme asset Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) may first decline to the Fibonacci retracement level at $0.47 before breaking out. However, he says Fartcoin may break out without retesting lower price targets. “Fartcoin is either consolidating for the next leg or going to be a great buy at $0.47 or something. I don’t know which it is. I’m still in it on a spot trade and will continue watching.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Fartcoin is trading for $0.55 at time of writing, down 1% in the last 24 hours.

Meme coins are staging their comeback tour with explosive momentum. With fresh U.S. economic data causing SERP volatility and retail-driven microcaps surging across the crypto landscape, it’s prime time to snag hidden gems before they go viral. This week, three meme coins capture all the buzz: Arctic Pablo Coin , SPX6900, and Act I: The AI Prophecy. Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the pack, a mythical meme adventure redefining the presale game with its location-based journey. Meanwhile, SPX6900 is flipping the script on S&P 500 fanboys with a troll-fueled mission straight from Wall Street’s basement. And then there’s Act I: The AI Prophecy, a surreal fusion of AI lore, cinematic vibes, and cutting-edge NFT tech that looks like it walked out of a Christopher Nolan multiverse. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Icebound Gateway to Unbelievable Returns In the heart of a frozen expanse where myths and magic blur into reality, Arctic Pablo is blazing a trail that few dare to follow. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s an odyssey through hidden locations, where every checkpoint reveals a new chance to cash in. But Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another token—it’s a movement.

Investors jumping in at the current price of $0.000083 are staring down a potential ROI of 9552.41%. Yup, that means a $100 investment could balloon to $9,638.55. Unsold tokens are burned each week, reducing supply and hiking up scarcity. This deflationary mechanic and a generous 66% APY staking program make Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) a rare combo of narrative firepower and real tokenomics. Those who stake APC will enjoy compounded growth, with coins vesting for just two months post-launch. Translation? Early birds don’t just get the worm—they get a fat stack of treasure. Arctic Pablo isn’t just walking; he’s racing through realms. The presale isn’t broken down into boring stages. Instead, it’s mapped out like a treasure hunt across mystical lands. Each location Pablo reaches, from the Frozen Fjords to the Lost Caverns, represents a new tier of opportunity. Crystal Cove could close any moment, and when it does, prices will rise. Blink, and that $100 ticket could turn into just $60 worth of APC in the next location. With over $2 million raised, Pablo’s legend is growing fast. The contract’s on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) and accepts almost every primary currency: BNB, ETH, BTC, USDT, SOLANA, XRP. Arctic Pablo isn’t just selling coins—he’s inviting the world to be part of a mythical adventure, bridging the gap between legend and real wealth. Don’t watch from the sidelines. Get in before Crystal Cove closes. It is one of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy This Week. SPX6900: Where Meme Chaos Meets Wall Street The stock bros thought they had it made.

Just raw, unfiltered hype with floor-busting liquidity and a growing list of degens stacking their bags for a potential parabolic breakout. The vibes?

42527031,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/understanding-the-volatility-of-cryptocurrency-markets,1743162384,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42527031.jpeg,Understanding the Volatility of Cryptocurrency Markets,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/understanding-the-volatility-of-cryptocurrency-markets,"Cryptocurrency markets are known for their sharp price swings. Prices can rise or fall dramatically within short periods. Some investors see this as an opportunity, while others view it as a risk. Knowing why these price movements happen will help cryptocurrency users make smarter moves regarding their investments in digital assets. What is Cryptocurrency Volatility? Volatility refers to how much an asset's price changes over time. In cryptocurrency, this means how quickly and by how much a coin’s value rises or falls. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies often experience large price swings due to speculation, liquidity, and global economic conditions. How Volatile Are Cryptocurrencies Compared to Traditional Assets? Cryptocurrencies are far more unpredictable than traditional assets like stocks or fiat currencies. For example, Bitcoin’s volatility often hits 60% to 100% on its Historical Volatility Index (BVOL), compared to the S&P 500’s steadier 15% to 20%. This was clear in 2021 when Bitcoin crashed from $64,000 to $30,000 in just a few weeks. What Causes Cryptocurrency Volatility? Cryptocurrency prices can change quickly due to various factors. Market speculation, government regulations, liquidity, technological updates, and economic conditions all play a role in these price swings. Market Sentiment and Speculation Public perception plays a big role in cryptocurrency prices. Positive news, such as companies investing in Bitcoin, often leads to price increases. Negative headlines, like government crackdowns, can cause prices to drop. Market Liquidity and Trading Volume Liquidity affects how easily an asset can be bought or sold without shifting its price. Bitcoin’s liquidity, for example, helps reduce extreme price swings compared to smaller cryptocurrencies. Technological Developments and Security Issues Blockchain upgrades, security breaches, and major hacks significantly affect cryptocurrency prices by shaping investor confidence. Positive developments, like faster or smarter blockchain technology, boost trust and demand. However, when a big hack or breach hits, it shakes faith in crypto’s safety and usually paves the way for panic sales that crash prices fast. How to Manage Cryptocurrency Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can change quickly, but there are ways to manage the risk. Using different strategies can help reduce losses and make smarter investment decisions. Diversification Investing in multiple assets reduces exposure to extreme price movements in any single cryptocurrency. By spreading funds across various coins, investors can cushion the blow if one asset crashes unexpectedly. Holding Long-Term (HODLing) Some investors focus on long-term growth rather than reacting to short-term price changes. Bitcoin has gone through many boom-and-bust cycles but has continued to recover over time. Using Stablecoins Stablecoins like USDT (Tether) help reduce risk during market fluctuations. Their value is tied to traditional currencies which makes them less volatile. By offering a buffer against extreme price swings, stablecoins can increase confidence in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Avoiding Emotional Decisions Making impulsive trades based on fear or hype often leads to losses. Staying informed and relying on research helps avoid costly mistakes. For instance, panic-selling during a sudden price drop might lock in losses, while buying into a hyped-up coin at its peak could mean overpaying. Will Cryptocurrency Volatility Change in the Future? Factors such as growing institutional involvement, the establishment of regulatory frameworks, and advancements in blockchain technology could collectively contribute to greater price stability. While the future remains uncertain, these developments offer a plausible foundation for a less volatile market over time. Institutional Investment The increasing participation of large financial institutions in cryptocurrency markets could serve as a stabilizing force over the long term. Over time, a greater institutional presence may foster a more structured trading environment. Technology and Market Growth As blockchain technology improves, transactions could become more efficient and secure. Wider adoption of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions may also help stabilize prices over time. Cryptocurrencies such as Tron and Ripple have experienced increased adoption, particularly as they have gained traction in the online casino industry. Players who like playing online slots or betting on sports appreciate their fast transactions and low fees, which led to greater adoption of these cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Developments Governments are exploring policies such as anti-money laundering rules or exchange oversight that could provide a more secure and predictable landscape for investors. By establishing boundaries, such measures may encourage broader participation and reduce the sharp price drops tied to sudden legal or policy shocks. Final Thoughts Cryptocurrency volatility creates both risks and opportunities. Large price swings can happen quickly, often influenced by speculation, regulations , and global economic conditions. Investors who understand these factors can make better decisions and reduce unnecessary risk. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-cardano-ada-is-stuck-in-a-channel-heres-the-significance/,"Cardano (ADA) is currently trading within a defined price channel, with analysts closely monitoring for a decisive breakout or breakdown. Crypto analyst Ali recently highlighted this pattern in a post on X, noting that ADA’s next major move will be triggered by a breakout above $0.77 or a breakdown below $0.69. This range-bound movement has caught the attention of traders, as it signals a critical inflection point for the asset’s price trajectory. Cardano’s Price Channel: What It Means When an asset is “stuck in a channel,” it means that its price oscillates between two well-defined support and resistance levels without making a significant move in either direction. In this case, Cardano is currently bound between $0.69 and $0.77, with neither buyers nor sellers taking full control of the market. This period of consolidation typically precedes a larger movement, and traders are watching closely to determine which direction ADA will take next. #Cardano $ADA is stuck in a channel. The next major move will be triggered by a breakout above $0.77 or a breakdown below $0.69. pic.twitter.com/50GTW1fnGw — Ali (@ali_charts) March 27, 2025 Ali’s analysis underscores that a breakout above $0.77 could serve as a bullish catalyst, potentially leading to further upside momentum. On the other hand, a drop below $0.69 may trigger bearish sentiment, putting ADA at risk of further declines. This makes the coming days crucial for Cardano, as the resolution of this channel could define its short-term price trend. Market Sentiment and Technical Outlook Cardano’s recent price behavior aligns with broader market trends, where major cryptocurrencies have been experiencing consolidation phases before decisive moves. The current structure suggests that traders are waiting for confirmation before entering positions, making volume and momentum key factors to watch. A breakout above the resistance level could see ADA targeting higher levels , possibly testing psychological price zones such as $0.80 and beyond. If the price breaks below the support level, however, it could lead to increased selling pressure, bringing ADA closer to the $0.65 range or lower. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Factors to Watch Several factors could influence which direction Cardano moves: Bitcoin and Market Trends: Given the correlation between ADA and the broader crypto market, movements in Bitcoin (BTC) could impact ADA’s price action. A bullish trend in BTC could support an ADA breakout, while a downturn could reinforce bearish pressure. Development and Adoption: Cardano’s ecosystem continues to expand, with growing interest in its smart contract capabilities and partnerships. Any major announcements regarding network upgrades or institutional adoption could positively influence price action. Investor Sentiment: A surge in trading volume and on-chain activity could provide insight into whether market participants expect an upward breakout or a downward move. Cardano’s current position within this trading channel highlights the importance of technical levels in determining its next move. As Ali pointed out, a breakout above $0.77 or a breakdown below $0.69 will dictate ADA’s short-term direction. Traders and investors should keep a close eye on price action, volume trends, and broader market conditions to anticipate the next major move. With Cardano at a pivotal point, its next breakout could set the stage for either a strong rally or a deeper correction.

The world of tokenized assets just witnessed a monumental surge. Buckle up as we dive into the electrifying news: the tokenized gold market cap has just smashed through all previous records, reaching an astounding $1.4 billion in March! This landmark achievement signals a growing appetite for digital representations of precious metals and underscores the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency space. Let’s explore what’s driving this gold rush in the digital age. Tokenized Gold Market Cap Soars to Unprecedented Heights The numbers don’t lie – they scream success! According to CoinDesk’s latest monthly stablecoin report, the total tokenized gold market cap has officially peaked at a remarkable $1.4 billion. This milestone, achieved in March, highlights the burgeoning interest in digital assets backed by physical commodities. Leading the charge are two titans in the tokenized gold arena: Tether Gold (XAUT) and PAX Gold (PAXG). These two tokens alone account for the vast majority of the market, with XAUT commanding a hefty $749 million and PAXG following closely with $653 million. This dominance underscores their established reputation and investor confidence in these platforms. But the story doesn’t end with market capitalization. Trading activity is also reaching fever pitch. The report reveals that tokenized gold trading volume hit a year-high of $1.6 billion in the same month. This surge in trading volume further validates the increasing liquidity and acceptance of tokenized gold within the crypto market. It signifies that investors are not just holding these assets; they are actively trading them, indicating a healthy and dynamic market. Tokenized Gold Asset Market Cap (USD) Tether Gold (XAUT) $749 Million PAX Gold (PAXG) $653 Million Total Market Cap $1.4 Billion What’s Igniting the Tokenized Gold Price Rally? So, what’s the secret ingredient fueling this impressive growth in the tokenized gold sector? Experts point to a significant factor: the recent surge in the price of physical gold itself. As traditional gold prices reached all-time highs, investors naturally looked for ways to capitalize on this upward trend. Tokenized gold offers a compelling and efficient avenue to do just that. The CoinDesk report suggests a direct correlation between the physical gold rally and the increased interest in its tokenized counterparts. When traditional gold shines, so does its digital twin! Think about it: as economic uncertainties loom and inflationary pressures mount, gold has historically been considered a safe haven asset. This reputation extends to tokenized gold , which inherits the inherent value and stability associated with the precious metal. In times of market volatility, investors often flock to gold as a store of value, and tokenized gold provides a modern, accessible, and easily tradable way to gain exposure to this timeless asset. Why Choose Tokenized Gold? Unveiling the Benefits Why are investors increasingly turning to tokenized gold over traditional gold investments? The answer lies in a compelling mix of benefits that cater to the modern investor: Fractional Ownership: Forget about buying whole gold bars! Tokenized gold allows you to own fractions of gold, making it accessible to investors of all sizes. You can invest with as little as you want, democratizing access to gold ownership. Ease of Trading: Trading tokenized gold is as simple as trading any other cryptocurrency. It’s available 24/7 on crypto exchanges, offering unparalleled liquidity and flexibility compared to traditional gold markets with their limited trading hours. Lower Storage Costs: Say goodbye to expensive and cumbersome gold storage solutions! Tokenized gold eliminates the need for physical storage, reducing costs and simplifying the investment process. The gold backing the tokens is securely stored by the issuing company. Portfolio Diversification: Tokenized gold offers a fantastic way to diversify your crypto portfolio and even your broader investment portfolio. It provides a hedge against market volatility and inflation, adding a layer of stability to your holdings. Transparency and Auditability: Reputable tokenized gold providers ensure transparency by regularly auditing their gold reserves. This provides investors with confidence that each token is truly backed by physical gold. Navigating the Tokenized Gold Landscape: Key Considerations While the allure of tokenized gold is undeniable, it’s crucial to approach this market with informed awareness. Here are some key considerations for potential investors: Issuer Reputation: Not all tokenized gold is created equal. Thoroughly research the issuer of the token. Look for established and reputable companies with a proven track record of transparency and secure gold storage. XAUT and PAXG, for instance, are issued by well-known and regulated entities. Redemption Process: Understand the redemption process. Can you easily redeem your tokens for physical gold if desired? What are the fees and procedures involved? Clarity on redemption is vital. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving. Stay informed about any regulatory developments that could impact the tokenized gold market in your jurisdiction. Security: While tokenized gold eliminates physical storage concerns, digital security is paramount. Use secure wallets and follow best practices for cryptocurrency security to protect your holdings. Seize the Golden Opportunity in the Digital Age The surge in the tokenized gold market cap to a record $1.4 billion is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of the evolving financial landscape. It signifies the growing acceptance of digital assets, the enduring appeal of gold as a store of value, and the innovative ways in which technology is democratizing access to traditional investments. As the price of gold continues to be volatile and the crypto market matures, tokenized gold stands poised to play an increasingly significant role in the portfolios of savvy investors. This explosive growth story is just beginning, and the potential for tokenized gold to reshape the future of precious metal investment is undeniably golden.

While the BTC price is still unable to surpass the $88,000 resistance as it approaches the end of the first quarter, rally expectations continue for the rest of 2025. At this point, Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, one of the world's largest financial consultancy firms, said that Bitcoin will reach a big six-figure target of $150,000 by the end of the year. Green said that Bitcoin could rise and reach $150,000 with the support given by US President Donald Trump to cryptocurrencies. Green also noted that Trump's tariff policies could lead to macroeconomic uncertainties and push investors to move their assets to safe havens. According to the CEO, some investors will view BTC as digital gold and invest their assets in BTC, which will support its rise. “Bitcoin has the opportunity to perform incredibly well. Trump’s support for crypto will support BTC. But Trump's tariff uncertainty is creating some chaos, leaving many people worried about what will happen in emerging markets and other countries. Of course, when there is uncertainty, more and more people invest in gold. But at some point, gold investors also want an alternative, and Bitcoin offers that alternative. With Trump's support, my goal for Bitcoin by the end of the year is $150,000.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: According to Famous CEO, Bitcoin Bullishness Is Not Over!

Posting a chart on X, the analyst suggested that the digital asset could reach an astonishing $1,452.81. The chart highlights a bull flag pattern, a technical formation often associated with continued upward momentum after consolidation. #XRP TO $1,452.81 DO YOU BELIEVE ME? pic.twitter.com/U8Dzu52Cf2 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 26, 2025 The Bull Flag Formation and Its Implications The chart shared by Steph illustrates a prolonged consolidation phase following a strong upward price movement. This pattern, referred to as a bull flag, is characterized by a steep price surge (the flagpole) followed by a rectangular consolidation period (the flag). Technical analysts often interpret this formation as a sign of a potential breakout, leading to another significant price increase. The chart marks XRP’s price movement over the past several years, showing its rise in 2017 to its all-time high in early 2018. This remarkable rally formed the flagpole, and the asset experienced a multi-year consolidation after this, trading within a downward-sloping channel that formed the flag. According to the analyst, the breakout from this formation signals the start of an aggressive price surge. The digital asset’s recent price surge, which began in November after former SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation , caused its price to break out of this 7-year flag, beginning its journey to $1,452.81. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Lofty XRP Price Target Steph’s projection of $1,452.81 per XRP is significantly higher than its all-time high of around $3.84, recorded in early 2018. While some traders view the bull flag breakout as a bullish indicator, the magnitude of this price target raises skepticism. The digital asset is currently trading at $2.3, and a climb to Steph’s target would require a surge of over 63,000%. XRP’s market capitalization would need unprecedented levels to support such a valuation. While many in the community see this as a barrier, some experts have shown that the market cap problem is a myth and won’t hinder the digital asset’s growth. Market Factors and Expectations While technical analysis can provide insights into potential price movements, broader market factors help determine XRP’s trajectory. The recent dismissal of the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has excited the community, as many experts expect this move to give the asset a significant boost. While a four-digit target is ambitious, the digital asset is in a good position to experience this massive surge, and the end of the lawsuit makes it more realistic.

42528400,https://blockworks.co/news/wct-role-in-onchain-economy,1743163200,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,WCT’s Role in the Onchain Economy,https://blockworks.co/news/wct-role-in-onchain-economy,"Every interaction in the onchain ecosystem starts with a wallet. Whether signing transactions, managing assets, or accessing apps, wallets serve as the critical gateway to digital ownership. But a wallet alone isn’t enough. It needs a way to connect, communicate, and function without friction across an expanding ecosystem, from gaming, finance, marketplaces, social and payments. This is where WalletConnect comes in. More than just a communications network, WalletConnect is the foundation for onchain interactions, ensuring wallets can operate securely, reliably, and at scale. As onchain activity grows, so does the need for decentralized, efficient, and permissionless connectivity. If you have engaged with the onchain economy you have used the WalletConnect Network. Wallets and WalletConnect: The Invisible Infrastructure Since its inception, WalletConnect has served as the backbone of onchain connectivity. Originally an open-source protocol for connecting wallets to apps, it has evolved into an essential piece of infrastructure. Today, WalletConnect enables millions of wallet connections, supporting everything from finance and digital assets to gaming and enterprise applications. Wallets rely on WalletConnect to establish secure connections, enable multi-chain interactions, and improve UX with transaction signing and execution. The WalletConnect Network is taking this a step further by decentralizing how connections are made, ensuring that no single entity controls the flow of transactions between wallets and apps. This shift is necessary as onchain activity scales, relying on centralized relays is not a sustainable path forward. The Role of WCT: From Past to Future What It Was Since its inception, WalletConnect has played a critical role in the onchain economy but it lacked a mechanism to sustain itself independently. The WalletConnect Token (WCT) was introduced to make decentralization possible, moving beyond a centralized model to a network where incentives drive participation. What It Is Today, WCT powers the WalletConnect Network by enabling network participation, governance, and long-term sustainability. Node operators earn WCT for relaying messages, ensuring decentralized and censorship-resistant connections. Token holders shape the evolution of WalletConnect’s infrastructure, ensuring the network remains aligned with the needs of the ecosystem. WCT also establishes an economic model that incentivizes developers, wallets, and apps to contribute to the network’s growth. What It Will Become The vision for WCT extends beyond what exists today. Over time, it will expand participation, bringing more wallets, apps, and relayers into the ecosystem, beyond the already huge adoption WalletConnect has seen. It will enable additional use cases, such as staking, reputation systems, and service-level guarantees for network reliability. As the WalletConnect Network matures, WCT will be the foundation for ensuring that wallets and apps remain interoperable without reliance on centralized systems. Underlying Infrastructure of Onchain Connectivity Wallet infrastructure is often overlooked, but without it, the onchain ecosystem would not function. As the industry moves toward an onchain-first future, WalletConnect is cementing itself as the essential connectivity layer, ensuring wallets remain the entry point for billions of users. The WalletConnect Network, powered by WCT, is more than a network, it is the next phase of decentralized infrastructure, designed to meet the demands of the next era of onchain applications. Every wallet connection, every signed transaction, every seamless app interaction reinforces this vision. With WCT, the network moves beyond reliance on a single entity, ensuring it remains permissionless, scalable, and sustainable. This is the path forward: to become the underlying infrastructure of connectivity. This content is sponsored and does not serve as an endorsement by Blockworks.

Moreno’s remarks added to ongoing debates within the crypto space regarding Gensler’s tenure at the SEC, many of whom felt he was overly aggressive and misaligned with the needs of the growing digital asset market. Gensler’s departure symbolized the end of what the crypto community saw as an unnecessarily combative relationship between the SEC and the crypto industry. Moreno calls Gensler one of the stupidest people in government Today in the Senate hearing Senator Bernie Moreno says former SEC Chair Gary Gensler ""was one of the stupidest people in government."" pic.twitter.com/0W2BUWssZd — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) March 28, 2025 Senator Bernie Moreno, who gained attention for defeating Elizabeth Warren’s anti-crypto efforts in Ohio, said that former SEC Chair Gary Gensler was “one of the stupidest people in government.” Senator Moreno made the comment during a recent hearing, where he was addressing Paul Atkins. “Man, you just have to be able to breathe and not be a complete raging lunatic, and you’re going to be the greatest SEC (chair) compared to the last guy. Congratulations on coming after Gary Gensler who, objectively, probably, was one of the stupidest people in government.” -Bernie Moreno, The U.S. Senator of Ohio President Donald Trump said last year that he would fire Gensler on his first day in office once he was elected. Gensler decided to step down and announced his resignation in November after Trump won the elections. Atkins has now been considered to lead the SEC as Gensler’s replacement. The former SEC chair faced criticism for his stance on cryptocurrency regulations, with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse accusing the SEC of regulatory overreach. The price of Bitcoin also surged towards $100,000 after Gensler’s resignation, reflecting optimism about a potentially less stringent regulatory environment. The former SEC official expressed his pride in his accomplishment and noted, “The SEC’s mission to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets has never been more important.” Democrats question whether Atkins fits the SEC Chair position Paul Atkins appeared before lawmakers along with Jonathan Gould, nominee for Controller of the Currency; Luke Petit, nominee for assistant treasury secretary for financial institutions; and Marc Molinaro, a former House member nominated to lead the Federal Transit Administration. The Senate Banking Committee Democrats noted Atkins’ previous positions and questioned whether he was the right person to take over the Securities and Exchange Commission. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts criticized Atkins for his votes to “loosen the reins on big investment banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns” prior to the financial crisis in 2008. She asked Atkins about a vote he cast in 2004 to reduce capital buffers for both firms and his subsequent comments that the move had nothing to do with the market collapse. The SEC Chair nominee argued that many factors contributed to the financial crisis after Warren asked whether he was wrong. She said, “Mr. Atkins has an almost perfect track record,” referring to his SEC position from 2002 to 2008. Warren argued that “he got pretty much everything wrong in the run-up to the biggest financial crash since the Great Depression.” The politician stated that Atkin’s record didn’t deserve the SEC promotion. Senator from Georgia Raphael Warnock questioned whether Atkins believed overregulation contributed to the financial crash. The former SEC commissioner answered “I don’t know about overregulation, I think it was misregulation, frankly – wasted resources and not focused on the actual problems that were there.” He also acknowledged that regulation should be smart, effective and appropriately tailored within the confines of the regulator’s statutory authority. “In short, clear rules of the road benefit all market participants,” Atkins added. The SEC Chair nominee was also probed for potential conflicts of interest surrounding his post-SEC life. After leaving the SEC, Atkins established Patomak Global Partners, a company that specializes in financial strategy, risk management, and compliance. Senator Warren argued that if Atkins is confirmed, he will be in a prime spot to deliver for his clients, who have been paying him millions of dollars for years. The former SEC commissioner said that if confirmed, he would sell Patomak. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott believes that Atkins will roll back the Biden administration’s disastrous practices and promote capital formation and retail investment opportunities. The politician also said that the SEC Chair nominee will provide long-overdue clarity for digital assets, which will ensure American innovation does not fall further behind.

The S&P 500 dropped by 0.33% to close the day at 5,693.31 on March 27, while the Nasdaq composite index declined by 94 points (-0.53%).

Earlier in March, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all goods from Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. Canada and Mexico have announced intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on US goods, escalating trade tensions and raising concerns about the impacts of a full-blown trade war. “Markets are expecting Trump’s April 2nd reciprocal tariffs day to be the end of uncertainty,” said capital market commentator The Kobeissi Letter in a March 26 post on X.

This pullback is accompanied by the “sharpest equities sell-off since the Yen Carry Trade issues ,” he explained about BTC price action during the last range sweep in August 2024. According to Daan Crypto Trades, Bitcoin needs to reclaim $90,000 to confirm that the range sweep was “just a shakeout” since this area remains a key technical barrier. “Price will still be heavily influenced by headlines, and with the 2nd of April (Tariff/Liberation Day) approaching, volatility is a guarantee.

Pay close attention! South Korean crypto giants Upbit and Bithumb have just issued a critical warning, designating Hifi Finance (HIFI) as a closely monitored asset . This significant development has sent ripples of concern through the crypto community. What exactly does this mean for HIFI, and more importantly, what are the implications for investors like you? Why the Sudden HIFI Closely Monitored Asset Designation? Both Upbit and Bithumb, leading cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, released simultaneous announcements on their official platforms. The core reason behind the HIFI closely monitored asset label boils down to serious concerns regarding transparency and communication. Let’s break down the specific issues raised: Inadequate Disclosures: The exchanges cited a lack of sufficient information being shared by the Hifi Finance team. In the fast-paced world of crypto, consistent and clear communication is paramount for investor confidence. Lack of Transparency in Business Plan Changes: Cryptocurrency projects often evolve, but Upbit and Bithumb pointed to changes in Hifi Finance’s business plan that were not communicated transparently to the public. This opacity raises red flags about the project’s direction and stability. Uncertainties About Project Progress: Perhaps the most concerning point is the ambiguity surrounding the actual progress of the Hifi Finance project. Exchanges need to ensure that listed assets are actively developing and moving forward. Doubts about progress can erode investor trust. These factors collectively led Upbit and Bithumb to classify HIFI as a closely monitored asset , signaling a heightened level of risk associated with this cryptocurrency. What Does ‘Closely Monitored Asset’ Really Mean? Understanding Crypto Exchange Risks For those unfamiliar with exchange terminology, being labeled a ‘closely monitored asset’ is akin to receiving a yellow card in a soccer match. It’s a serious warning sign indicating that the exchange has concerns but hasn’t yet taken the drastic step of delisting. However, it’s crucial to understand the potential implications of such a designation, as it often precedes more severe actions. Here’s what the crypto exchange risks associated with a closely monitored asset status typically entail: Increased Volatility: News of a ‘closely monitored’ status often triggers market uncertainty. Investors may panic and sell off their holdings, leading to sharp price drops and increased price swings. Decreased Liquidity: As traders become wary, trading volume for the asset can decline. Reduced liquidity makes it harder to buy and sell HIFI at desired prices, potentially exacerbating losses. Potential Delisting: This is the ultimate risk. If the concerns raised by Upbit and Bithumb are not adequately addressed by Hifi Finance, or if new issues arise, delisting becomes a real possibility. Delisting from major exchanges significantly reduces accessibility and can severely impact the price of the asset. Think of it this way: exchanges are gatekeepers to the crypto market. When they raise alarms about an asset, it’s a signal investors shouldn’t ignore. The crypto exchange risks associated with closely monitored assets are substantial and demand careful consideration. Upbit and Bithumb’s Official HIFI Warning: A Closer Look To truly grasp the gravity of the situation, let’s examine excerpts from Upbit and Bithumb’s official announcements regarding the Upbit HIFI warning and Bithumb HIFI warning . Upbit’s Announcement Highlights: “We have designated Hifi Finance (HIFI) as an Investment Warning Coin… due to concerns about insufficient disclosure, changes in the business plan without prior notice, and uncertainty about project progress.” This statement clearly points to a lack of communication and transparency from the Hifi Finance team, raising doubts about the project’s operational integrity and future direction. Bithumb’s Announcement Echoes Similar Concerns: “Bithumb has designated Hifi Finance (HIFI) as an Investment Caution Item to protect investors… We have determined that there are circumstances that may cause investor caution due to issues such as lack of information disclosure and unclear project progress.” Bithumb’s emphasis on “protecting investors” underscores the seriousness of their concerns. Both exchanges are prioritizing user safety by flagging HIFI, urging investors to exercise extreme caution. South Korean Crypto Regulation and Exchange Scrutiny This situation unfolds within the context of increasingly stringent South Korean crypto regulation . South Korea has emerged as a major cryptocurrency market, and regulators are keen on ensuring investor protection and market stability. Exchanges in South Korea operate under close regulatory scrutiny and are expected to maintain high standards of due diligence when listing and monitoring digital assets. The proactive measures taken by Upbit and Bithumb to designate HIFI as a closely monitored asset reflect this regulatory environment. South Korean crypto regulation pushes exchanges to be vigilant and act swiftly when potential risks are identified. This incident serves as a reminder of the robust oversight in the South Korean crypto space and the importance of exchanges acting as responsible gatekeepers. What Should HIFI Holders Do Now? Actionable Steps & Investor Caution If you are currently holding HIFI tokens, it’s time to take this Upbit HIFI warning and Bithumb HIFI warning seriously. Here are some actionable steps you should consider: Stay Informed and Monitor Closely: Your first step should be to actively monitor official announcements from Upbit, Bithumb, and Hifi Finance itself. Pay attention to any statements, updates, or responses from the Hifi Finance team addressing the exchanges’ concerns. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Evaluate your personal risk tolerance. Are you comfortable holding an asset flagged with such serious concerns? Consider the potential for further price drops and even delisting. Consider Reducing Exposure: Based on your risk assessment, you might want to consider reducing your HIFI holdings. This could involve selling a portion or all of your tokens to mitigate potential losses if the situation worsens. Diversify Your Portfolio: This is a fundamental principle of investing. Avoid concentrating your crypto portfolio in a single asset, especially one facing heightened risks. Diversification can cushion the impact of negative events affecting individual cryptocurrencies. Seek Professional Advice (If Needed): If you are uncertain about the best course of action, consider consulting with a financial advisor who understands the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in the Crypto Market The designation of Hifi Finance (HIFI) as a closely monitored asset by Upbit and Bithumb is a stark reminder of the inherent risks within the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the critical importance of transparency, communication, and regulatory compliance for crypto projects. For investors, this situation serves as a valuable lesson in vigilance, risk management, and the need to stay informed about the assets they hold. The future of HIFI remains uncertain, but the warnings from these major exchanges should not be taken lightly. Always conduct thorough research and exercise caution when navigating the volatile world of crypto investments.

42527617,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144180,1743163237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Move: GameStop Plunges $1.3B into Bitcoin – Genius or Gamble?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gamestop-bitcoin-convertible-bonds/,"In a move that has sent ripples through both the gaming and cryptocurrency worlds, GameStop (GME), the meme stock icon, has announced a surprising foray into Bitcoin. The company plans to issue a staggering $1.3 billion in convertible bonds, with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for acquiring Bitcoin. But is this a strategic masterstroke or a risky gamble? Let’s dive into the details and dissect this intriguing development. GameStop’s Audacious Bitcoin Bet: Unpacking the Convertible Bonds GameStop, known for its brick-and-mortar video game retail and its dramatic stock saga, is venturing into the digital asset realm. The company revealed its intention to issue $1.3 billion worth of convertible bonds. These aren’t your typical bonds; they can be converted into GameStop shares at a predetermined price in the future. The key takeaway here is that GameStop aims to use a portion of this massive capital infusion to invest in Bitcoin . This marks a significant shift for a company primarily associated with physical retail, signaling a potential pivot towards digital assets and diversifying its treasury strategy. Here’s a breakdown of what convertible bonds are and why GameStop might be using them: Convertible Bonds Explained: These are debt securities that can be converted into equity (stock) at a specific conversion ratio and price. They offer investors the potential upside of stock appreciation while providing the downside protection of a bond. Why Convertible Bonds for GameStop? Raise Capital: Issuing bonds is a way for companies to raise substantial capital without immediately diluting existing shareholders (unlike issuing new stock directly). Lower Interest Rates: Convertible bonds often carry lower interest rates compared to traditional bonds because of the embedded conversion option, making them attractive for issuers. Attract Investors: They can attract a broader range of investors who are interested in both fixed income and potential equity upside. Bitcoin Investment Rationale: While GameStop hasn’t explicitly stated the exact percentage of bond proceeds for Bitcoin , the intention is clear. This move could be driven by several factors: Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification beyond traditional assets and could potentially act as a hedge against inflation. Yield Generation: Depending on the strategy, GameStop might explore yield-generating opportunities within the crypto investment space. Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin could be seen as a move to modernize GameStop’s image and appeal to a tech-savvy audience. Investor Sentiment Rollercoaster: GME Stock’s Wild Ride Post-Announcement The market reaction to GameStop’s Bitcoin announcement has been anything but predictable. Initially, GME stock experienced an 11% surge in after-hours trading, fueled by the excitement surrounding the crypto venture. However, this initial enthusiasm proved short-lived. The stock quickly reversed course, plummeting a dramatic 24% to reach its lowest point of the year at $21.46. This volatile swing underscores the mixed investor sentiment surrounding GameStop’s strategic shift. Let’s examine the factors contributing to this turbulent market response: Positive Reactions Negative Reactions Innovation Perception: Some investors might view the Bitcoin move as innovative and forward-thinking, signaling GameStop’s willingness to adapt to the evolving digital landscape. Potential for High Returns: Believers in Bitcoin ‘s long-term growth potential might see this as a shrewd investment that could significantly boost GameStop’s balance sheet in the future. Strategic Diversification: Diversifying into a new asset class like Bitcoin could be perceived as a prudent risk management strategy. Core Business Concerns: Skeptics might question whether investing in Bitcoin distracts from addressing the fundamental challenges facing GameStop’s core retail business in a rapidly digitizing gaming market. Stock Dilution Fears: The issuance of convertible bonds inherently implies potential stock dilution in the future when bondholders convert their bonds into shares, which can negatively impact existing shareholders. Bitcoin Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Investors might be concerned about GameStop exposing itself to this risk, especially given the company’s past financial struggles. Lack of Crypto Expertise: Questions arise about GameStop’s expertise in managing crypto investment and navigating the complexities of the digital asset market. Navigating the Crypto Seas: Benefits and Challenges for GameStop GameStop’s foray into Bitcoin presents both exciting opportunities and significant hurdles. The success of this venture will hinge on careful execution and a clear strategy. Let’s weigh the potential benefits against the inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: First-Mover Advantage in Gaming Retail: GameStop could position itself as a pioneer in the gaming retail sector by embracing cryptocurrency, potentially attracting a new wave of crypto-savvy customers and partners. Enhanced Treasury Management: Bitcoin could offer an alternative to holding large cash reserves, potentially generating better returns and acting as a hedge against inflation. New Revenue Streams: Beyond simply holding Bitcoin , GameStop could explore integrating crypto into its business model, such as accepting Bitcoin as payment, offering crypto-related products or services, or even exploring NFTs and blockchain gaming initiatives in the future. Increased Brand Visibility and Buzz: The Bitcoin move has undoubtedly generated significant media attention and could revitalize GameStop’s brand image, attracting a younger, digitally native demographic. Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of Bitcoin poses a significant risk. A sharp downturn in the crypto market could negatively impact GameStop’s balance sheet and GME stock price. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and varies across jurisdictions. Changes in regulations could impact GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy. Operational Complexity: Managing crypto investment , ensuring security, and complying with regulations require specialized expertise and infrastructure, which GameStop may need to develop or acquire. Investor Skepticism: As evidenced by the stock price reaction, not all investors are convinced of the wisdom of this move. GameStop needs to effectively communicate its strategy and build confidence in its crypto venture. Expert Outlook and Actionable Insights Financial analysts and crypto investment experts are offering diverse perspectives on GameStop’s Bitcoin gambit. Some analysts believe it’s a bold and potentially lucrative move, aligning GameStop with a growing asset class and demonstrating forward-thinking leadership. Others express concerns about the lack of synergy between GameStop’s core business and Bitcoin , the risks associated with volatility, and the potential for distraction from addressing fundamental business challenges. Actionable Insights for Investors: Do Your Research: Thoroughly understand Bitcoin , convertible bonds, and GameStop’s business strategy before making any investment decisions. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Assess your comfort level with volatility and risk, as both GME stock and Bitcoin are known for price swings. Monitor Developments: Keep a close watch on GameStop’s execution of its Bitcoin strategy, regulatory changes in the crypto space, and market reactions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification remains a key principle in managing investment risk. Conclusion: GameStop’s Crypto Leap – A High-Stakes Game GameStop’s decision to embrace Bitcoin through a $1.3 billion convertible bond offering is undoubtedly a shocking and audacious move. It’s a high-stakes game with the potential for significant rewards or considerable risks. Whether this foray into crypto will revitalize GameStop and propel it into a new era of growth, or prove to be a costly distraction, remains to be seen. The market’s initial volatile reaction reflects the uncertainty and divided opinions surrounding this strategic pivot. As GameStop navigates this uncharted territory, the world will be watching closely to see if this meme stock darling can successfully transform itself into a crypto-savvy contender.

At the start of November 5, the price of XRP was just $0.5037. Since then, the market has grown by over 340.61%. During the period, it has outperformed the top two cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Experts believe that 2025 could be a landmark year for XRP. Why? Curious to know more? Read on! Ripple’s Legal Settlement in the SEC Case Ripple recently reached a positive settlement in its long-standing legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The development has provided more clarity about the XRP regulatory environment. It is expected to encourage more institutional players to enter the market. Stablecoin Regulation & Crypto Custody: A Game-Changer for Ripple Ripple is planning to launch new stablecoins. Experts believe that new laws will support the stablecoin segment of Ripple immensely. The SEC recently repealed SAB 121 and issued SAB 122. The new guideline allows banks and financial institutions to apply existing accounting standards for potential losses related to holding customer crypto. Instead of listing all custodied cryptos to liabilities, they can treat potential risks as contingent liabilities. With the new development, banks and other traditional financial institutions might be more willing to enter the crypto custody market. Crypto researcher Anders claims that now that the rule is gone, institutional players might be more interested in offering crypto custody and they could use Ripple’s technology to do it, making Ripple’s custody services more popular. XRP ETFs on the Horizon Anders forecasts that an XRP Spot ETF will be approved by the US SEC in the second half of 2025. At least 10 ETF fund management firms have expressed their interest to launch their XRP Spot ETFs. Polymarket bettors suggest that there is a 84% chance that the US SEC will provide approval for an XRP Spot ETF in 2025. Anders predicts that if the SEC approves an XRP ETF, the XRP price could reach as high as $8. XRP’s Potential Role in the US Digital Asset Stockpile Recently, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hinted that XRP might be included in the US Digital Asset Stockpile – which was established by US President Donald Trump through an executive order. In conclusion, with regulatory hurdles cleared and institutional adoption on the rise, XRP could be one of the biggest crypto success stories of 2025. Will Ripple’s momentum lead to a record-breaking rally?

Despite its potential to create ATHs like $294.33, the token trades at $130.70 amid crypto market downturns. Although there’s the possibility of trend reversal, there are significant risks, as SOL price’s recovery to $140 would wipe out $69.62M. Why? Let’s discuss this. Why Did Solana’s Price Drop 5% Today? Solana price has been facing continuous resistance rejections to surge to the $150 mark. Its price surged to nearly $147 a few hours ago but dropped soon. In the last 24 hours alone, the token’s worth had dropped 5%, and it currently trades at $130.70 with a market capitalization of $67.15B. Although this drop is part of the global crypto market downtrend , investors lost confidence in this altcoin, which cannot be ignored. In 2024, it gained significant traction and rallied due to the popularity of Solana meme coins, but that has faded as the demand for these cryptos decreased. The drop in the onchain activity and trading volume clearly explains this investors’ diverted attention. Earlier reports revealed that the 7-day dApp revenue declined nearly 50% within two weeks. At the same time, the fees declined. Critics showed concern that the rising competition amid the introduction of better blockchain networks may impact Solana’s performance significantly. Solana Price Prediction: $140 Rebound to Wipe Out $69.62M Along with many altcoins, Solana is also battling a bearish trend. However, that may not persist as the experts believe it is in a consolidation phase and running within a parallel channel pattern. Analyzing the SOL USDT price chart and analysts’ predictions reveals that it is at a crucial juncture where it can result in an uptrend or a downtrend. Interestingly, a massive liquidation will occur with the SOL price rebounding to $140, wiping out $69.62M in shorts. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez X’s post further confirms this prediction, as he claims a surge to $140 would result in millions of liquidation. This is because the exchange closes the positions of the traders who bet on declines. An upswing to $140 for Solana SOL would liquidate $69 million in short positions! This would result in an SOL price downturn only in the short term, as the liquidation will force buyers to buy back tokens, resulting in a price surge. What’s Next For Solana? Although the $140 mark is the crucial liquidation point, this could influence the price. Experts’ Solana price predictions claim that a surge past this could result in the much-anticipated rally to $240 and higher, but the failure to surge to that will result in a prolonged downturn. Investors must continue to monitor SOL’s next price moves, mainly as SOL ETF approval is being discussed.

The settlement addresses claims that Galaxy promoted LUNA without disclosing its holdings and sales to the public, leading to significant profits. The New York Attorney General's investigation found that Galaxy Digital engaged in misleading public statements and failed to disclose its sales of LUNA tokens while promoting them. This conduct violated New York laws, resulting in the substantial fine. Galaxy had purchased 18.5 million LUNA tokens in 2020 at a 30% discount, paying $0.22 per token.

42527896,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144185,1743163830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Relief for Crypto: SEC Dismisses Cases Against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-dismisses-kraken-consensys-cases/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples of relief through the cryptocurrency world, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dropped its legal hammers against three major industry players: Kraken Exchange, Consensys, and Cumberland. This unexpected move, confirmed by Eleanor Terrett of Crypto in America, marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape and raises crucial questions about the future of crypto regulation in the United States. For businesses and enthusiasts alike, this development offers a moment to pause and reassess the ever-evolving rules of engagement in the digital asset space. SEC Dismisses Kraken Case: A Wave of Relief for the Crypto Exchange The news of the SEC dismissing its case against Kraken is undoubtedly a major win for the popular cryptocurrency exchange. While details of the specific charges initially leveled against Kraken remain somewhat opaque in this dismissal announcement, the mere fact that the SEC has chosen to withdraw its legal action speaks volumes. Kraken, known for its robust trading platform and wide array of cryptocurrency offerings, has been operating under increased regulatory scrutiny, like many of its peers. This dismissal offers Kraken a chance to breathe and refocus on innovation and expansion without the immediate shadow of SEC litigation looming. What does this mean for Kraken and its users? Reduced Legal Burden: The most immediate benefit is the removal of significant legal costs and management bandwidth associated with defending against an SEC lawsuit. Improved Market Sentiment: The dismissal can boost investor confidence in Kraken, potentially leading to increased trading volume and user acquisition. Strategic Flexibility: Without the legal cloud, Kraken can more aggressively pursue its strategic goals, whether it’s expanding into new markets or launching innovative products. This development is not just a victory for Kraken; it’s a positive signal for the broader exchange industry, suggesting that perhaps a more nuanced and less adversarial approach to regulation might be emerging. Consensys SEC Lawsuit Dropped: Ethereum Community Celebrates Crypto Regulation Relief For Consensys, a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem and the developer behind MetaMask, the dismissal of the SEC lawsuit is an even more profound victory. Consensys has been instrumental in building the infrastructure that underpins much of the decentralized web, and any legal action against them was seen as a direct challenge to the Ethereum network and its community. The withdrawal of the lawsuit is being widely celebrated within the Ethereum community as a crucial step towards crypto regulation relief and a validation of the innovative work being done in the space. Why is this dismissal significant for Consensys and Ethereum? Validation of Ethereum Technology: A lawsuit against a core Ethereum infrastructure company could have been interpreted as an implicit attack on the technology itself. The dismissal can be seen as a tacit acknowledgement of the legitimacy of Ethereum and its ecosystem. Boost for Web3 Development: Consensys plays a vital role in the development of Web3 applications. Removing legal uncertainty encourages further investment and innovation in this space. Positive Impact on MetaMask Users: MetaMask, a widely used crypto wallet, is a Consensys product. This dismissal can reassure users about the regulatory standing of key tools in the crypto ecosystem. The Consensys case was particularly sensitive because it touched upon the very foundations of decentralized technology. Its dismissal is a strong indicator that regulators may be starting to understand the nuances of this technology and are willing to adjust their approach. Cumberland SEC Action Resolved: Market Makers Breathe Easy with Crypto Legal Clarity Cumberland, a DRW company, is a prominent over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading firm and market maker. The SEC’s decision to drop its action against Cumberland brings a sense of crypto legal clarity to the often-opaque world of institutional crypto trading. Market makers like Cumberland are essential for providing liquidity in the crypto markets, and regulatory uncertainty can severely hamper their operations. This dismissal offers a much-needed sigh of relief for Cumberland and other firms operating in this critical sector of the crypto industry. What are the implications of the Cumberland dismissal? Encourages Institutional Participation: Clarity on regulatory matters encourages more institutional investors and market makers to engage with the crypto market, enhancing liquidity and stability. Reduces Systemic Risk: A healthy and regulated OTC market reduces systemic risks within the crypto ecosystem. Dismissing actions against key players like Cumberland supports this. Promotes Market Efficiency: Market makers play a crucial role in price discovery and market efficiency. Regulatory certainty allows them to operate more effectively, benefiting the entire market. The resolution of the Cumberland case is a positive signal for institutional crypto players, indicating a potential move towards a more constructive regulatory dialogue and a better understanding of the market’s operational needs. Crypto Regulation Relief: Broader Implications and the Path Forward The simultaneous dismissal of cases against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland is not just a coincidence; it likely reflects a broader shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation relief , or at least a tactical recalibration. Whether this signifies a fundamental change in the SEC’s stance or a temporary adjustment remains to be seen. However, the immediate impact is undeniably positive for the crypto industry. It suggests a potential move away from aggressive enforcement actions and towards a more collaborative approach to establishing regulatory frameworks. What could this shift mean for the future of crypto regulation? Potential for Constructive Dialogue: Dismissals could pave the way for more open and constructive dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry. Focus on Clear Guidelines: Instead of regulation by enforcement, the SEC might be signaling a move towards providing clearer guidelines and frameworks for crypto businesses to operate within. Encouragement for Innovation: Reduced regulatory pressure can foster innovation and growth within the crypto sector, allowing companies to focus on building and expanding rather than constantly battling legal challenges. Consensys SEC Lawsuit and Cumberland SEC Action: Understanding the Context While the news is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to remember that the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency remains complex and evolving. The SEC’s decision to drop these specific cases does not necessarily mean an end to regulatory scrutiny. It is crucial for crypto businesses to continue prioritizing compliance and engaging proactively with regulators. Understanding the nuances of cases like the Consensys SEC lawsuit and Cumberland SEC action , even in dismissal, provides valuable insights into the areas of regulatory concern. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses: Maintain Compliance Focus: Even with these dismissals, compliance remains paramount. Stay updated on regulatory developments and maintain robust compliance programs. Engage in Regulatory Dialogue: Proactively engage with regulators and industry bodies to contribute to the development of sensible and effective crypto regulations. Seek Legal Counsel: Continuously seek expert legal advice to navigate the complex and evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Moment of Optimism, But Vigilance Remains The SEC’s dismissal of cases against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland is undoubtedly a significant and welcome development for the cryptocurrency industry. It offers a moment of optimism and suggests a potential shift towards a more balanced regulatory approach. However, the crypto landscape is constantly changing, and vigilance remains key. The industry must seize this opportunity to work collaboratively with regulators to establish clear, sensible rules that foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining market integrity. This SEC dismisses Kraken case action is a step in the right direction, but the journey towards regulatory clarity and long-term stability is ongoing.

Onchain data shows that only two Bitcoin mining pools mined over 51% of all BTC in the last three years. Here is why it matters and could raise a centralization alert for the leading blockchain network. Finbold retrieved this information from mempool.space , a Bitcoin data aggregator and block explorer, gathered directly from an observer node. Essentially, this data ranks Bitcoin mining pools per their mined blocks against the total blocks mined in a certain period. In the last three years from March 28, 2025, the Bitcoin mined blocks were highly dominated by two mining pools. Precisely, Foundry USA published 46,076 blocks (28.72%) and AntPool 34,365 blocks (21.42%), out of 160,432. Together, these mining pools have mined 90,441 blocks, or 56.37% of the total, in the last three years. Bitcoin mining pool ranking. Source: mempool.space Why does it matter to have only two mining pools above the 51% threshold According to the whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto , Bitcoin’s value proposition lies in achieving consensus over the blockchain state in a decentralized manner. This is achieved via Bitcoin mining, when special nodes (the miners) use computational power to crack cryptographic hashes, discovering blocks. Once the blocks are discovered, the miner gains the right to collect the coinbase, which are newly created BTC units. Besides the coinbase, miners can also add transactions to the blocks, collecting their respective fees. For that, the miner needs to broadcast the discovered block with both their coinbase transaction and all the third-party transactions. Other nodes, as designed by Satoshi, will follow the longer chain, which means the chain with more proof-o-work attached to it, or more added blocks. There is a theoretical attack called the 51% attack, which, theoretically, could allow a bad actor to make double spends. Moreover, Bitcoin mining pools could deliberately censor transactions from being broadcasted, if they control enough of the mined blocks. Finbold reported a case where F2Pool, the third-largest Bitcoin mining pool, was caught – and later admitted – filtering transactions. At its current state, the Bitcoin network has a Nakamoto Coefficient of two. The Nakamoto coefficient is a metric that measures the decentralization of a blockchain network by determining the minimum number of independent entities (like miners) needed to control or disrupt the network. Bitcoin mining pools and not individual miners or nodes While each pool is supposedly made of different miners, it’s the pool coordinator, a single entity, responsible for setting the block, broadcasting it to the network, collecting the rewards, and then, if they want, distribute it to their miners. Therefore, the mining pools are the relevant entities when measuring the current blockchain consensus decentralization state. Not the individual miners or nodes, that can migrate only once it is too late, under a hypothetical attack. We have also seen cases where transaction fees were not distributed to AntPool miners , as expected, but sent back to the sender. Furthermore, AntPool was also the protagonist of another discovery by the renowned pseudonym analyst b10c. According to the researcher, data suggests the second-largest mining pool could have strong influence over five other Bitcoin mining pools . Looking at the merkle branches that mining pools send to miners as part of stratum jobs, it's clear that the BTCcom pool, Binance pool, Poolin, EMCD, Rawpool, and possibly Braiins* have exactly the same template and custom transaction prioritization as AntPool. https://t.co/KTjFWtTXEP pic.twitter.com/xhCrdvkOH8 — b10c (@0xB10C) April 17, 2024 In conclusion, Bitcoin decentralization could be in check as economies of scale dynamics play out, increasing big miners’ dominance. The more blocks a mining pool discovers, the more rewards it collects from newly issued BTC and transaction fees. This allows for larger investments in infrastructure, easier access to capital, and even more dominance over future block mining. Featured image from Shutterstock.

The filing states: “Ultimately, Galaxy helped a little-known token increase its market price from $0.31 in October 2020 to $119.18 in April 2022, while profiting in the hundreds of millions of dollars.“ As part of the settlement agreement, Galaxy will pay $200 million in monetary relief over three years: $40 million within 15 days, another $40 million within one year, and two additional payments of $60 million due within the second and third years, respectively. Related: A beginner’s guide on algorithmic stablecoins Galaxy Digital reportedly spread fake news The filing also accused Galaxy Digital and Novogratz of spreading false claims about Terra’s usage. In particular, the firm allegedly stated that the South Korean payments app Chai was built on the Terra blockchain, which was not accurate. This claim was also included in a press release sent to Bloomberg highlighting that the app “hosts over 2 million users and generates $1.2 billion in annualized transaction volume.” The release reads: “These statements were false. They were based on representations by Kwon and Terraform to Galaxy, but Galaxy failed to independently verify them.“ Galaxy Digital’s Novogratz mentions Terra usage in Chai following Terra’s collapse. Source: Galaxy Digital Related: Terra’s Do Kwon’s US court hearing delayed as prosecutors review a swath of new evidence Terra’s collapse and market fallout Terra and its algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), both experienced a dramatic collapse due to a breakdown in the mechanism designed to maintain UST’s peg to the US dollar back in May 2022. The event occurred when a large holder sold a substantial amount of UST. The large sell-off triggered market panic, causing UST to deviate from its expected value. The mechanism intended to stabilize UST involved minting new LUNA tokens to buy back UST, resulting in massive LUNA supply inflation and creating intense downward pressure on LUNA’s price. As Cointelegraph reported at the time , if the market cap of LUNA became lower than that of UST, there would not be enough funds to maintain the peg of the stablecoin. With the asset backing the stablecoin losing value as its supply continued to increase, the assets entered a self-reinforcing spiral, which caused both assets to lose nearly all their value within hours. This wiped out billions in market capitalization and triggered a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. The memory of the event is still fresh, with the Sonic blockchain’s recent unveiling of a high-yield algorithmic stablecoin being met with fears due to perceived similarities .

In addition to its bearish technicals, Bitcoin is contending with low whale demand and macro headwinds ahead of Donald Trump’s Liberation Day next week. Peter Brandt Warns that Bitcoin Price Could Crash One of the most popular traders on X has predicted that the Bitcoin price could implode below $70,000 in the coming days. Such a move would point to a 18% drop from the current level. Peter Brandt, who has authored a popular book on technical analysis, said that it would not be unreasonable for Bitcoin to crash. He said this in response to another trader who pointed to the chart below. This chart shows that Bitcoin price has faced substantial resistance around the $90,000 mark. Bitcoin Price Forecast It has failed to move above that level several times in March. At the same time, the coin has formed a rising wedge pattern, whose two lines have converged near the key resistance at $89,000. This resistance was notable since it was the neckline of the double-top pattern at $108,675. Therefore, a combination of a double-top, a break-and-retest, a death cross, and a wedge pattern points to a bearish BTC price forecast . In this case, the initial target would be at $76, 430, the lowest level this month. Such a move would point to more downwards, potentially to last March’s high of $73,827 and then below $70,000. The bearish Bitcoin outlook will become invalid if the Bitcoin price rises above key resistance levels at $90,000, then $95,000, and $100,000. Bitcoin Price Chart BTC At Risk Ahead of Options Expiry There are a few potential bearish catalysts for the Bitcoin price. First, options worth over $16.5 billion will expire on Friday, with the maximum pain being at $85,000. Historically, Bitcoin experiences some intense volatility when there is such a big expiry. Further, there are signs that whales are levering, meaning that less Bitcoins is moving to the derivative market. This feature often signals a reduced risk appetite, which is often a bearish catalyst for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Whale Activity From a macro level, Bitcoin price may crash ahead of next week’s Liberation Day , when Donald Trump will introduce his reciprocal tariffs . These will be huge tariffs targeting friends and foes of the United States. In the short term, these large tariffs will be bearish as fear spreads in the market. However, the tariffs may trigger a recession in the long term, triggering a monetary and fiscal response, including stimulus cash and low interest rates. Bitcoin does well in an era of easy money.

The OS will help integrate the agents into business-ready workflows, boosting their performance up to 10 times faster than traditional methods. PwC further revealed that the command center would also help create more complex, multi-agent businesses at a larger scale. The audit firm pointed out the existence of AI agents as embedded features within different platforms, developed as standalone applications or applications built on open-source software development kits (SDKs) or proprietary software. The company added the issues with the existing AI agents as embedded features in platforms, making it harder for the applications to communicate, collaborate, or scale effectively. The firm further pointed out that PwC’s agent OS would aid in the development and organization and incorporate the agents into different business models, platforms, and enterprise tools in a consistent and scalable ecosystem. PwC insisted that the OS would also push companies toward AI adoption while moving away from AI experimentation. Aagent OS will act as a unified execution layer for AI agents, with PwC describing the system as the central nervous system and powering system of enterprise AI agents. The OS will also enable companies to utilize different enterprise systems, including SalesForce OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, GitHub, Google Cloud, and more. PwC reveals real-world solutions to clients through AI agents The audit firm revealed several situations its AI agents had provided PwC clients with real-world solutions. The announcement confirmed that PwC had helped a tech company revamp user engagement using AI agents by integrating an AI agent-powered omnichannel contact center. The company highlighted that the successful integration led to an improvement in customer satisfaction by approximately 10%. The AI agent system further enabled a 60% cut in call transfers and up to 25% reduced phone time. The company further disclosed its use of PwC’s agent OS to empower its employees while strengthening the base it has created in AI use to improve the productivity of its services, including assurance, tax, and advisory services. PwC added that the firm had deployed over 250 AI agents across its platform, further establishing its leadership in AI adoption and scaling AI operations. The company insisted that the OS drove responsible and efficient AI deployment while boosting the PwC ecosystem. PwC also offered other instances the PwC’s agent OS could come in handy, including in manufacturing, logistics and supply chain management, marketing, regulatory compliance, information review and analysis, and more. The company has already leveraged the system in hospitality and healthcare to improve management systems, automating services, research support, support in precision medicine, and more.

If you’re operating or planning to operate a crypto firm in the United Kingdom, you need to buckle up. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK’s financial watchdog, is gearing up to introduce a brand-new authorization regime for crypto businesses, slated to kick off in 2026. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a comprehensive overhaul designed to bring greater clarity and security to the burgeoning digital asset market. Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the future of crypto in the UK. Understanding the Impending UK Crypto Regulation Revolution The current regulatory framework for crypto assets in the UK is evolving, and the FCA’s proactive approach signals a significant step towards establishing a more robust and tailored system. Matthew Long, the FCA’s director of payments and digital assets, recently highlighted the regulator’s commitment to creating a UK crypto regulation framework that is both effective and adaptable to the unique characteristics of the crypto industry. This new authorization regime is a direct result of extensive consultations with crypto firms, ensuring that the rules are not just imposed but are also practical and aligned with industry realities. What does this mean in plain English? Comprehensive Study: The FCA is dedicating this year to an in-depth study of various aspects of crypto regulation. This includes critical areas like stablecoins, the backbone of many crypto transactions, crypto exchanges where digital assets are traded, and staking, a mechanism for earning rewards on crypto holdings. New Rules on the Horizon: Following this study, expect a wave of new rules specifically designed for crypto firms. These rules will likely cover a wide range of operational aspects, from consumer protection to anti-money laundering measures. Authorization Regime Overhaul: The centerpiece of this initiative is the implementation of a new crypto authorization regime . This regime will define how crypto firms become officially recognized and regulated in the UK, ensuring they meet stringent standards before being allowed to operate. Why is a New Crypto Authorization Regime Necessary? The digital asset space is rapidly evolving, and with it comes a unique set of challenges and risks. The FCA’s move towards a dedicated crypto authorization regime is driven by several key factors: Consumer Protection: Protecting consumers is paramount. The new regime aims to ensure that crypto firms operate with integrity and transparency, safeguarding users from potential scams and financial losses. Market Integrity: A robust regulatory framework is essential for maintaining the integrity of the crypto market. This includes preventing market manipulation, ensuring fair trading practices, and fostering investor confidence. Combating Financial Crime: Crypto assets have been identified as potential tools for money laundering and terrorist financing. Stricter authorization and ongoing supervision will help mitigate these risks. Clarity and Certainty for Businesses: For crypto firms, navigating the existing regulatory landscape can be complex. A dedicated regime provides much-needed clarity, outlining clear rules and expectations, which can foster innovation and growth within a compliant framework. What Can Crypto Firms in the UK Expect? While the specifics of the new FCA crypto rules are still under development, we can anticipate certain key changes and requirements for crypto firms operating in the UK: Area Potential Changes Under New Regime Authorization Process Likely to become more rigorous, potentially requiring firms to demonstrate stronger financial stability, robust security measures, and comprehensive compliance frameworks. Ongoing Supervision Increased scrutiny and regular reporting to the FCA to ensure continuous compliance with regulations. Capital Requirements Potential introduction of specific capital adequacy requirements tailored to the risks associated with different types of crypto activities. Operational Standards Stricter rules on operational resilience, cybersecurity, and data protection to safeguard customer assets and information. Marketing and Advertising Expect tighter regulations on how crypto firms market their products and services to ensure fair and transparent communication with consumers. Navigating Digital Asset Regulation UK: Key Challenges and Opportunities The journey towards a new digital asset regulation UK framework is not without its challenges. Both regulators and crypto firms will need to navigate complexities and adapt to evolving circumstances. Here’s a look at some key aspects: Challenge: Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The FCA needs to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation in the crypto space and implementing effective regulation. Overly restrictive rules could stifle growth, while lax regulations could expose consumers to undue risks. Opportunity: Enhancing UK’s Crypto Hub Status: A well-designed regulatory framework can actually enhance the UK’s position as a global crypto hub. By providing clarity and stability, the UK can attract reputable crypto businesses and investment. Challenge: Keeping Pace with Technological Advancements: The crypto industry is characterized by rapid technological innovation. Regulators need to be agile and adaptable to keep pace with these changes and ensure regulations remain relevant and effective. Opportunity: Fostering Consumer Trust: Strong regulation can build trust in the crypto market among consumers and institutional investors alike. This increased trust is crucial for the long-term growth and adoption of digital assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Firms in the UK As the UK prepares for this significant regulatory shift, here are some actionable steps crypto firms should consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on FCA announcements and consultations related to the new authorization regime. Subscribe to industry publications and attend relevant webinars and events. Engage with Regulators: Actively participate in consultations and provide feedback to the FCA. This is an opportunity to shape the regulations and ensure they are practical and effective.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. AI-fueled memecoins are gaining serious momentum, and Codename:Pepe is aiming to lead the charge. Table of Contents Codename:Pepe — The Pepe on a mission for smarter crypto trading Presale opportunity: Discounted entry into AGNT The vision for an AI trading ecosystem Staking and rewards system Security, tokenomics and roadmap Positioning Codename:Pepe for growth AI-driven automation is shaking up the cryptocurrency world, making trading, security, and DeFi smarter than ever. These AI-powered tools are optimizing lending rates, managing liquidity pools, and refining portfolio strategies, helping decentralized finance become more efficient and adaptable. And the market is taking notice. AI-related crypto tokens have skyrocketed, hitting a combined $7.02 billion market cap as of February 2025, a clear sign that investors are paying attention. Some recent success stories really drive home the hype. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) exploded by 3,500% in 2024, pushing its market cap to $2.7 billion, while Fetch.ai (FET) surged to a $1.38 billion market cap. Even lesser-known projects like Nosana (NOS) saw a 987.9% spike in early 2024. And then there’s Turbo (TURBO) , a meme-like AI token that still managed to climb 136.75% in just a week. AI hype is clearly driving massive price swings. One project that’s gaining momentum is Codename:Pepe, which is making waves with its expanding ecosystem and advanced tech. With AI adoption in blockchain accelerating, Codename:Pepe could break into the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Codename:Pepe — The Pepe on a mission for smarter crypto trading Codename:Pepe is Pepe with a purpose. Inspired by artificial intelligence and built on the legendary image of Pepe the Frog, this memecoin embraces the vision of bringing intelligence to the chaotic world of crypto trading. While its features, including AI-powered trading tools, signals, and an exclusive DAO, are still in development, the project is already gaining traction among investors who see its long-term potential. At the heart of Codename:Pepe is the AGNT token, which is designed to grant holders future access to AI-generated forecasts, automated trade signals, exclusive reports, and membership in a private DAO where strategies and investment opportunities will be shared. The roadmap also includes an AI-powered launchpad for new memecoins, promising a next-level approach to early-stage investing once implemented. Presale opportunity: Discounted entry into AGNT Operating on the Ethereum Mainnet, AGNT ensures accessibility and security for its holders. The current presale offers investors a chance to buy in at a lower price before its anticipated exchange debut: Current Stage (5th of 28): $0.005555 per token. Next Stage (6th): Price will increase to $0.006666. Target Listing Price: $1. With five presale stages already selling out in just a few days, demand for AGNT appears to be rising. The community-driven hype surrounding the project is fueling speculation that Codename:Pepe could become one of the next major memecoins in the AI-crypto trend. The vision for an AI trading ecosystem Codename:Pepe aims to develop a fully automated trading ecosystem, featuring an AI-driven trader that will execute memecoin trades based on market signals. Planned features include algorithmic auto-trading, customizable strategies, and passive income opportunities through AI-driven trading models. However, these elements remain in the early planning stages, making AGNT a speculative investment with future potential rather than an immediate-use product. Beyond trading, the project envisions an exclusive DAO where AGNT holders will participate in investment decisions, gain insider analytics, and vote on new projects launched through the AI-powered launchpad. A mutual DAO fund is also in the works, designed to share profits among stakers and create long-term incentives for the community. As memecoins continue to dominate speculative trading, Codename:Pepe aims to offer an AI-powered launchpad that will allow investors to engage with early-stage projects. The platform intends to use AI analysis to assess potential meme tokens before launch, giving the community access to insights before making investment decisions. DAO members will vote on which projects to support, reinforcing a decentralized approach to token launches. Staking and rewards system The staking system for Codename:Pepe is structured to reward long-term holders with access to exclusive benefits. The plan includes multiple staking tiers: Base Level: Access to AI trading signals once they are developed. Advanced Level: Unlocks DAO membership, AI trading tools, and launchpad privileges upon implementation. Elite Staking: Future profit-sharing from the DAO fund and exclusive investment opportunities. Security, tokenomics and roadmap While Codename:Pepe’s smart contracts have been successfully audited by Pessimistic, a trusted security firm, the project remains in its infancy. Its tokenomics are structured to support long-term sustainability, with 25% of tokens allocated to staking and rewards, encouraging holders to stay engaged. Another 20% is reserved for the presale, ensuring an early-entry opportunity, while 10% is dedicated to liquidity and exchange listings. To drive visibility, 15% has been allocated for Key Opinion Leader (KOL) partnerships. Importantly, no additional tokens will be minted, preserving controlled supply and price stability. The roadmap outlines three key phases: Phase 1: Focuses on the presale, ecosystem launch, initial partnerships, and community building. Phase 2: Plans to introduce token listings, influencer collaborations, staking rewards, and the first steps toward AI-powered tools. Phase 3: Aims for mass adoption, further AI enhancements, and integration with major crypto platforms. Positioning Codename:Pepe for growth Codename:Pepe is tapping into two of the most lucrative trends in the market, AI and memecoins, positioning itself as a contender for significant market impact. If Codename:Pepe successfully executes its vision, it could rise through the ranks and establish itself among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. For early adopters, this is an opportunity to join a project that blends humor with high-tech ambition, paving the way for a new kind of AI-powered meme economy.

Despite $135M in liquidity, capital expenditures make cash burn a concern, necessitating successful revenue generation from new ventures. The company's transformation introduces speculative risks, including potential share dilution and dependency on BTC pricing for the current operation. Future revenue opportunities in HPC/AI are promising but uncertain, requiring careful monitoring of project developments and customer contracts. Bitfarms Overview Bitfarms ( BITF ) just came out with its Q4 2024 earnings. It's one of my more-covered stocks, with plenty of ups and downs in 2024. BITF 1Y Price History (Seeking Alpha) In that time, the stock is down 48% and a true penny stock once more, less than a buck per share. Starting in 2024 as a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company, it navigated a takeover attempt by Riot Platforms (RIOT). After rotating leadership, the company is now embarking in a different direction as an ""energy and compute company."" The change here is interesting, and the price decline may help, but I still think it has much to prove and maintain my Hold rating before upgrading to Buy. BITF Stock - Financial Health Before we get into the current mission of Bitfarms, let's look at their financial situation. Balance Sheet (BITF Financial Statements) From their 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements, we they ended 2024 $59.5M in cash and $87.3M in digital assets (mined BTC that they retain). Altogether, it's about $150M in liquidity, with their Q4 presentation indicating about $135M liquidity in March. Balance Sheet (BITF Consolidated Financial Statements) Thankfully, this is supported by very minimal debt on the balance sheet as well. Cash Flow Statement (BITF Consolidated Financial Statments) When looking at cash burn, we see that it increased from 2023 to 2024 with every major component of free cash flow. Operating cash flows burn $35M more. Capex burned about $240M more. Prepayments on capex burned about $30M. These heavy capital expenditures, which I discussed at length in the past, were primarily on BTC miners, cryptographic machines designed to be good at solving blocks to generate BTC. As mining this cryptocurrency is globally competitive, it is a constant arms race (and thus constant cash burn) and requires the constant purchase of more and more. At these levels, BITF's $135M in liquidity doesn't seem sufficient for a single year, unless the shift in the company changes the cash burn. Let's talk about that. Energy and Compute During the Q4 earnings call , the Ben Gagnon (CEO who succeeded in the aftermath of Riot's attempted takeover) said of Bitfarms: Bitfarms is a completely different company than we were at the beginning of 2024. Across nearly every dimension, we have rapidly transformed ourselves from the international Bitcoin miner to a North American energy and compute company. The owes to a realization that occurred for them. All of the electrical capacity that they had been developing over the years for BTC mining is very useful for businesses looking to build out data centers for AI, and they have decided to turn this into a prime revenue opportunity. Q4 2024 Company Presentation Their latest earnings presentation almost immediately starts with the divestiture of their Yguazu site in Paraguay. While there were some energy cost efficiencies for mining BTC at that site, it offered no opportunities to support HPC/AI initiatives and the sale was announced earlier this month. This provided the company an extra $63M in cash. Q4 2024 Company Presentation It reflects the shift from being an international BTC miner to being a North American energy and compute company. Again, note the emphasis on megawatts, with BTC mining and company-wide hash rate being less central to the strategy. There are some direct benefits to the cash burn, which Gagnon stated in the call: Lastly, both of these accretive transactions have better capitalized us for 2025 and beyond for the following reasons. First, the sale of Yguazu reduced our planned CapEx requirements for 2025 to less than $100 million , 20% lower than we laid out at the start of the year, and frees up the invested capital and profits from the sale of our Yguazu site for reinvestment in US infrastructure. And added: Second, we've avoided the additional significant expenses that would have been required to both complete construction, energize, and fill the 200 megawatt Yguazu site with new miners. We estimate this to be a savings of $325 million. CFO Jeffrey Lucas said of capex: Importantly, we have no plans for large miner purchases in 2025 or 2026 and will instead focus our capital on developing US energy and HPC infrastructure. So there's good reason to think cash burn will decline on the capex side, but revenue also needs to be generated for that trend to reverse, and so they need real projects to provide their electrical assets to AI data centers. The first likely sites for HPC/AI conversion are the three in Pennsylvania, something they had discussed before. Q4 2024 Company Presentation It therefore largely becomes a question of when these actually become revenue opportunities. During Q&A, Gagnon said the due diligence by hyperscaler customers would likely be a 9 - 12 month process. He noted, however, that some of the development process of a project could begin in this time as well. He noted also that there is a spectrum of options customers could pursue: The potential CapEx and potential returns that you get across these scenarios, you can think of it like a spectrum, and they're not really mutually exclusive when you start on the lowest CapEx side, which is just powered land, CapEx requirements are pretty modest and you can get a fairly decent [Technical Difficulty] the end-customer lined-up to start working on a powered shell. And then beyond that, you have full build-to-suit. Management declined to give too many specifics about exactly the nature of these contracts and how they would be structured to generate revenue. Q4 2024 Company Presentation Whatever these end up being, they are nevertheless guiding for a much larger operation here and therefore an ambitious revenue opportunity. Risks Given all of this, the risks to an investment in BITF are currently: Speculative nature of HPC/AI revenue Potential share dilution to cover cash burn Weakness in BTC pricing The first one owes to the fact that the transformation into an energy and compute company is a very recent one, and it's clear from management's own remarks that they are still figuring out many of the specifics that customers will want. The size of these projects and, therefore, the revenue such contracts generate, is very speculative in nature. Nearly all of 2024's revenue was from BTC mined, so we don't have a great idea from the MWs they do monetize how much money this makes them either. Suffice to say, however, that these will probably be multi-million dollar deals with returns clearly more attractive to management than building out more miners. As 2024 revenue was just under $200M, revenue from early work on the projects mentioned might only grow 2025's revenue by a few percent, and meaningful changes are likely a couple years out. BITF Total Shares Growth (Seeking Alpha) This means that unless BTC appreciates significantly to make Bitfarms finance itself better, only about two years of liquidity remains with the capex guidance they gave. Seen above, dilution is a regular part of the story of BITF, and it may occur again before the opportunities for HPC/AI segment reach fruition. BITF's market cap near $473M for revenue under $200M and cash burn isn't exactly cheap, but it isn't priced for growth in the HPC/AI business either. In a few years, it's conceivable that such a company could be earning between $50M and $100M per year, even if that does require us to speculate a bit. All things considered, the growth, the potential for dilution, the slight discount too book value, I think BITF is fairly valued, not Buy but a Hold. Conclusion Bitfarms continues to be an interesting company. Negative as many of my points have been, I do feel much better about the plan going forward because the HPC/AI business is serving more of a real need for which there can be cash flow to support it. The economics of BTC mining just didn't seem sustainable. With all of that said, I've let you know why it didn't become a Buy with this change either. Bitfarms needs to go further than just prospective deals with customers, and as future quarters roll out, we'll need to listen carefully about the specifics of these new revenue opportunities.",BITF|BITF:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-28 13:30:00

Sun becomes the second Chinese entrepreneur, after Jack Ma, and the fourth crypto exchange figure, following CZ, SBF, and Brian Armstrong, to achieve this prestigious recognition. Forbes profiles Sun as a “ Crypto Billionaire Who Helped The Trumps Make $400 Million ,” highlighting his distinct influence and global vision. Sun’s Crypto Empire: From Disruptor to Industry Leader The Forbes feature portrays Sun as a figure of “youth, controversy, and immense wealth.” Born in 1990, Sun has built a reputation for bold, unconventional moves within the blockchain space. “In my 20s I was just trying everything, “ Sun shares, illustrating his hands-on, entrepreneurial approach to innovation.

Meanwhile, Crypto.com announced that the SEC closed its investigation into the platform without taking action. This is part of the broader regulatory shift under new SEC leadership. In other legal news, a Texas judge recommended allowing Logan Paul’s defamation lawsuit against YouTuber Coffeezilla to proceed. This is due to the fact that the YouTuber’s statements about Paul’s failed CryptoZoo project could be seen as factual claims rather than opinions. South Carolina Ends Staking Lawsuit Against Coinbase South Carolina became the latest US state to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase over the crypto exchange's staking services. The lawsuit accused Coinbase of offering unregistered securities through its staking program, and was officially dropped in a joint stipulation between Coinbase and the South Carolina Attorney General’s securities division on March 27. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, celebrated the dismissal , and called it a victory not only for the company but also for American consumers. He is now also hopeful that other states will follow suit soon. South Carolina joined Vermont in abandoning legal action against Coinbase. Both states were among 10 that initially filed enforcement actions against Coinbase’s staking services on June 6 of 2023. Interestingly, this was the same day the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a similar lawsuit, which was itself dismissed on Feb. 27, 2025. The remaining states that continue to pursue similar enforcement actions are Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin. Grewal pointed out that South Carolina residents lost an estimated $2 million in staking rewards as a result of the state’s legal action. He held firm that American crypto holders deserve clear rules and consumer protections, and praised South Carolina for standing up for fairness and encouraging other states to reconsider their restrictions on staking. South Carolina also recently took a pro-crypto step with the introduction of a new bill that could allow the state to invest in Bitcoin. The ” Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act of South Carolina ” was introduced on March 27 by Representative Jordan Pace, and it proposes allowing the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to digital assets like Bitcoin. The bill specifically mentions Bitcoin several times, setting a cap of up to 1 million Bitcoin for the reserve. This is similar to the US federal government’s recently established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The proposed legislation permits Bitcoin investments across various state-managed funds, including the General Fund and the Budget Stabilization Reserve Fund. Although the bill focuses primarily on Bitcoin, it does not exclude the possibility of including other digital assets. This move was made during a broader trend across the US, with 42 Bitcoin reserve bills introduced at the state level in 19 states, of which 36 remain active. SEC Drops Crypto.com Investigation Crypto.com also received some good news after the SEC officially closed its investigation into the company without taking any action. The development was announced by Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek on March 27, who reflected on the regulatory pressure the firm faced. He even claimed that authorities used every available tool to try to stifle the company's growth. The investigation closure happened seven months after the SEC issued a Wells notice to Crypto.com in August of 2024, signaling its intent to bring legal action against the platform. After the Wells notice, Crypto.com filed its own lawsuit against the SEC in October, accusing the agency of regulatory overreach and a misguided approach to crypto regulation. In a statement on March 27, Crypto.com’s chief legal officer Nick Lundgren welcomed the closure of the investigation and criticized the previous SEC leadership for trying to harm the crypto industry. This decision is part of a broader shift in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation under the leadership of acting chair Mark Uyeda, who took over in January after the resignation of Gary Gensler. Since then, the SEC rolled back several enforcement actions and lawsuits against major crypto companies, including Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, OpenSea, and Immutable. The SEC also dismissed its civil case against crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW with prejudice on March 27. Additionally, the SEC introduced a Crypto Task Force that is led by Commissioner Hester Peirce to encourage a more constructive regulatory environment. It also reversed a controversial rule in January that required financial firms holding crypto assets to list them as liabilities on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, Crypto.com has been advancing its business partnerships, and recently collaborated with Trump Media to launch a series of “Made in America”-themed crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The platform will provide infrastructure and custody services for these ETFs, which are expected to include a basket of leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and its native token, Cronos (CRO). Judge Backs Logan Paul Defamation Lawsuit There are some new legal developments in the NFT space as well. A Texas magistrate judge recommended that influencer Logan Paul be allowed to proceed with his defamation lawsuit against YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, who is also known online as “Coffeezilla.” In a report that was filed on March 26, Magistrate Judge Henry Bemporad advised that federal Judge Orlando Garcia deny Findeisen’s request to dismiss the case, and stated that the YouTuber’s statements about Paul’s failed CryptoZoo project were presented more like factual claims than opinions. Logan Paul filed the lawsuit in June of 2024, and accused Findeisen of making defamatory remarks in an X post and two YouTube videos, which Paul claims caused huge reputational damage. The statements in question included Findeisen labeling Paul a “serial scammer” and describing CryptoZoo as a “scam” and a “massive con.” CryptoZoo was introduced as a blockchain game where players could purchase NFT “eggs” that would hatch into animals. These could then be bred to create unique creatures and earn tokens. So far, the game has not launched yet. Findeisen argued that his statements were intended as opinions and pointed to disclaimers in his video descriptions. However, Judge Bemporad found that the disclaimers were not prominently displayed and would not negate the potentially defamatory nature of Findeisen’s claims. He concluded that Paul sufficiently demonstrated at the pleading stage that the statements could be seen as defamatory. Both parties now have 14 days to object to the judge’s recommendation.

This trend may soon end if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moves ahead and approves the 16 spot Ripple ETFs that have been applied. This article explores a near risk-free trade idea if the SEC approves these ETFs tomorrow. XRP Price Could Rise if SEC Approves Ripple ETF XRP, the third-biggest cryptocurrency, has seen increased demand from retail and institutional investors lately. One sign of this is the fact that it has had the most spot ETF applications this year, totaling 18. Wall Street companies like Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary, and Fidelity have all applied for these funds. Odds of these ETFs have jumped in the past few months, moving from 59% in January to 85% today. These odds have remained elevated after the SEC ended its Ripple appeal this month. Polymarket ETF Odds Analysts expect the XRP price to explode higher in case of approval. One analyst hinted that the price of Ripple would jump to $5 , while another one sees XRP hitting $8 . These forecasts point to big swings ahead for a coin trading at $2.2. Trade Idea for Ripple for the Ripple ETF Approval Traders have several strategies to anticipate the potential XRP ETF approval. One of these approaches is just to go long the coin, and hope that the approval will push it much higher after the approval. The risk with this approach is that the XRP price has formed a head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart. Its head is at around $3.40, while the shoulders and neck are at $3 and $1.94, respectively. XRP Price Formed a H&S pattern A H&S pattern is one of the most bearish patterns, meaning that a breakdown is possible, especially when it loses the support at $1.9447. This risk exists because it is unclear when the SEC will approve the XRP ETFs. Another approach is to use long-dated call options to position for the XRP ETF approval . A call option is a trade that gives one a right, but not an obligation to buy an asset at a certain strike price. Consider the following scenario if you expect the Ripple price to hit $3.5 by June 27, when the approval will have happened. Strike: $3.50 Ask price: $0.217 Delta: 0.32 Max Risk: $0.217 Max profit: Unlimited Breakeven price at expiry: $3.717 In this case, your risk will be capped and have an unlimited profit potential, if you expect the coin to jump to $3.50. Another approach is to buy a $4/$5 call spread, where you risk about $0.076 to potentially make $0.924, representing a 12x return if the coin closes at or above $5. XRP Options Table for June Summary The upcoming XRP ETF approval may lead to a strong surge in the coming months, and the options market provides better scenarios. As this report demonstrates, the options market provides an ideal opportunity from a risk-reward perspective.

Recently, the US SEC dismissed litigations against Kraken, Cumberland, and Consensys, sparking curiosity about the status of the XRP lawsuit. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett took to X to share insights on the possible reasons behind the SEC’s delay in the Ripple case. Let’s take a closer look at the Ripple case and the SEC’s decision to exclude the platform while dropping lawsuits against other crypto companies. Is US SEC Further Delaying the XRP Lawsuit? In her recent X post, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett shared insights on the possible reasons for the SEC’s delay in the XRP lawsuit. While the SEC intentionally missed Ripple while dismissing cases against other major firms, Terret stated that the move wasn’t surprising. Emphasizing the unique circumstances of the Ripple case, Terrett stated, “No Ripple here but I’m not entirely surprised because, again, it is slightly different to these other cases.” The journalist pinpointed the complexities surrounding the XRP lawsuit unlike other crypto lawsuits. The SEC’s approach to resolving the XRP lawsuit differs from other crypto cases due to an existing injunction. To move forward, the SEC must request Judge Torres to lift this injunction, allowing them to proceed with voting on the withdrawal of the appeal and other related matters. SEC Dismisses Kraken, Cumberland, Consensys Cases In a recent development, the US SEC officially announced the dismissal of the crypto lawsuits involving Kraken, Cumberland, and Consensys. This decision comes after the SEC filed a joint stipulation with each company. The filing agrees to dismiss the cases with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled. It is noteworthy that the dismissal comes without any financial implications for the crypto firms. Dropping the lawsuits, the Commission underscored the irrelevance of the cases. However, the regulator clarified that its decision does not imply a change in its position on the underlying issues of the lawsuits. As highlighted by Terrett, these dismissals do not impact or influence the ongoing XRP lawsuit. Meanwhile, the Ripple lawsuit is expected to follow specific procedures, which may lead to a delay in its conclusion. The settlement process for the Ripple lawsuit involves several steps. This includes the SEC’s request to lift the existing injunction and the subsequent voting on the withdrawal of the appeal. Recently, attorney Fred Rispoli shared a possible timeline for the Ripple case settlement. He stated that the lawsuit will end within the next 60 days. How This Delay in the Ripple Lawsuit Settlement Impact XRP Price? Amidst the complexities and uncertain timeline surrounding the Ripple case settlement, the XRP price faces major corrections. As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.21, with a 5.38% dip in a single day. Over the past week and month, XRP has plummeted by 6.7% and 2.2%, respectively. Despite this negative trend, a positive sentiment persists among investors, as indicated by a 17.6% surge in trading volume, currently at $3.85 billion. This sparks a bullish prediction for XRP, with analysts foreseeing its ascendance to $11 .

The approval enables Bitpanda to offer its digital asset platform to investors in the UAE , giving access to more than 500 virtual assets alongside crypto indices and savings plans. Dubai has positioned itself as a leading digital asset hub, with VARA providing regulatory clarity and investor protection. Bitpanda hopes to match this ambition, setting a new benchmark for secure and compliant virtual asset investing in the region. The company has established a permanent office at the DMCC Crypto Centre and assembled a regional team to tailor its offerings to the UAE market. Onboarding for investors will begin in the coming months. In January, Bitpanda received a MiCA license from Germany’s financial regulator, enabling it to operate under a unified framework across all 27 EU member states. The license established a single regulatory regime for Europe’s crypto industry, addressing previous fragmentation.

The document, filed on March 27, asks for a rule change to list the Grayscale Avalanche Trust (AVAX). The derivative product in question would be a conversion of Grayscale Investments’ close-ended AVAX fund launched in August 2024 . Grayscale said on its website that “its SEC-reporting Products present a strong case for uplisting when permitted by the U.S. regulatory environment.” The firm explained that, following the conversion, “the arbitrage mechanism inherent to ETFs would help the product more closely track the value” of the assets. At the time of publication, the Grayscale Avalanche Trust holds $1.76 million worth of assets under management. The current net asset value per share is $10.86 for just over 0.49 AVAX per share, worth $10.11 according to CoinMarketCap data , which puts the fund’s current market price at a 7.4% premium to the value of its underlying assets.

The firm is among those currently waiting for the approval of its XRP spot ETF , as well as other products. Other examples include its spot Cardano ETF filing and its Litecoin Trust conversion to an ETF . These filings also follow the company’s successful conversion of its Ether and Bitcoin close-ended funds into spot ETFs. In 2024, Grayscale Investments also announced the conversion of a part of its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs into spinoff products. The new Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and Grayscale Ether Mini Trust (ETH) feature lower fees and follow their derivatives, losing capital to more cost-effective options.

This made it the only US-based Bitcoin ETF with a negative investment flow at the time. This product offering has the highest management fee among all the products, set at 1.5% per annum. The other ETFs range from 0.15% for the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust to 0.25% for the highest-priced competitors. The situation, looking at Ethereum ETFs, is quite similar, with the lowest fee being the Grayscale Ether Mini Trust and the highest being its older Ethereum trust product.

Following a sharp multi-week selloff that dragged Bitcoin from above $100,000 to below $80,000, the recent price bounce has traders debating whether the Bitcoin bull market is truly back on track or if this is merely a bear market rally before the next macro leg higher. Bitcoin’s Local Bottom or Bull Market Pause? Bitcoin’s latest correction was deep enough to rattle confidence, but shallow enough to maintain macro trend structure. Price seems to have set a local bottom between $76K–$77K, and several reliable metrics are beginning to solidify the local lows and point towards further upside. The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) is one of the most reliable sentiment gauges across Bitcoin cycles. As price fell, NUPL dropped into “Anxiety” territory, but following the rebound, NUPL has now reclaimed the “Belief” zone, a critical sentiment transition historically seen at macro higher lows. Figure 1: The NUPL indicates a bullish rebound in sentiment. View Live Chart The Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple weighs BTC spending by both coin age and transaction size, and compares the data to a previous yearly average, giving insight into long term holder behavior. Current readings have reset to low levels, suggesting that large, aged coins are not being moved. This is a clear signal of conviction from smart money. Similar dynamics preceded major price rallies in both the 2016/17 and 2020/21 bull cycles. Figure 2: The largest and most experienced bitcoin holders have stopped selling. View Live Chart Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Boost Bull Market We’re also now seeing the Long Term Holder Supply beginning to climb. After profit-taking above $100K, long-term participants are now re-accumulating at lower levels. Historically, these phases of accumulation have set the foundation for supply squeezes and subsequent parabolic price action. Figure 3: Long Term Holder BTC supply is rapidly increasing. View Live Chart Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Signal Bull Market Cross The Hash Ribbons Indicator has just completed a bullish crossover, where the short-term hash rate trend moves above the longer-term average. This signal has historically aligned with bottoms and trend reversals. Given that miner behavior tends to reflect profitability expectations, this cross suggests miners are now confident in higher prices ahead. Figure 4: Bitcoin miners are becoming bullish once again. View Live Chart Bitcoin Bull Market Tied to Stocks Despite bullish on-chain data, Bitcoin remains closely tied to macro liquidity trends and equity markets, particularly the S&P 500 . As long as that correlation holds, BTC will be partially at the mercy of global monetary policy, risk sentiment, and liquidity flows. While rate cut expectations have helped risk assets bounce, any sharp reversal could cause renewed choppiness for Bitcoin. Figure 5: BTC remains highly correlated to US Equities. View Live Chart Bitcoin Bull Market Outlook From a data-driven perspective, Bitcoin looks increasingly well-positioned for a sustained continuation of its bull cycle. On-chain metrics paint a compelling picture of resilience for the Bitcoin bull market. The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has shifted from “Anxiety” during the dip to the “Belief” zone after the rebound—a transition often seen at macro higher lows. Similarly, the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple has reset to levels signaling conviction among long-term holders, echoing patterns before Bitcoin’s rallies in 2016/17 and 2020/21. These metrics point to structural strength, bolstered by long-term holders aggressively accumulating supply below $80,000. Further supporting this, the Hash Ribbons indicator ’s recent bullish crossover reflects growing miner confidence in Bitcoin’s profitability, a reliable sign of trend reversals historically. This accumulation phase suggests the Bitcoin bull market may be gearing up for a supply squeeze, a dynamic that has fueled parabolic moves before. The data collectively highlights resilience, not weakness, as long-term holders seize the dip as an opportunity. Yet, this strength hinges on more than just on-chain signals—external factors will play a critical role in what comes next. However, macro conditions still warrant caution, as the Bitcoin bull market doesn’t operate in isolation. Bull markets take time to build momentum, often needing steady accumulation and favorable conditions to ignite the next leg higher. While the local bottom between $76K–$77K seems to hold, the path forward won’t likely feature vertical candles of peak euphoria yet. Bitcoin’s tie to the S&P 500 and global liquidity trends means volatility could emerge from shifts in monetary policy or risk sentiment. For example, while rate cut expectations have lifted risk assets, an abrupt reversal—perhaps from inflation spikes or geopolitical shocks—could test Bitcoin’s stability. Thus, even with on-chain data signaling a robust setup, the next phase of the Bitcoin bull market will likely unfold in measured steps. Traders anticipating a return to six-figure prices will need patience as the market builds its foundation.

On March 26, Magistrate Judge Henry Bemporad recommended that the San Antonio federal court reject Coffeezilla’s motion to dismiss the case, finding that Findeisen’s statements could be considered defamatory rather than mere opinions. Judge Backs Paul’s Defamation Claims The lawsuit, filed in June 2023, alleges that Coffeezilla X posts and YouTube videos labeled Paul a “serial scammer” and characterized CryptoZoo as a “scam” and a “massive con.” Paul contends that these claims caused significant reputational damage. In his ruling, Judge Bemporad wrote that Paul had adequately demonstrated that the statements in question were “reasonably capable of defamatory meaning” and could not simply be dismissed as opinions. The judge also criticized disclaimers by Coffeezilla, which were only visible in the expanded video description section, noting that they were not popular enough to shield Findeisen from defamation claims. CryptoZoo Fallout Fuels Legal Battles Paul’s CryptoZoo project , launched with much fanfare, was promoted as a blockchain-based game where players could purchase NFT eggs, hatch them into animals, and breed them to create rarer species. The project promised players the chance to earn tokens based on the rarity of their creatures. However, the game never materialized, leaving investors empty-handed. In 2022, Coffeezilla released three exposé videos accusing Paul of running a scam, though Paul did not sue over those. However, the influencer threatened legal action at the time, later backtracking and apologizing in January 2023 . He eventually pledged $2.3 million for refunds, offering compensation to affected investors on the condition that they waive their right to sue. Meanwhile, Paul is also facing a class-action lawsuit from a group of CryptoZoo buyers who claim they were defrauded . Both Paul and Findeisen have 14 days to file objections to Judge Bemporad’s report. If upheld by Judge Orlando Garcia, the ruling would allow Paul’s defamation lawsuit to move forward.

The BNB Chain Meme Liquidity Support Program, which kicked off on Feb. 18, offers $200,000 in permanent liquidity to the top-performing memecoins on the chain. But controversy erupted on day two of the competition on Feb. 19 when two memecoins — both inspired by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s dog Broccoli — went head-to-head. In the end, the Broccoli token ending in address “714” was declared the winner over the one ending in “F2B.” However, supporters of the F2B token say the result doesn’t add up. Related: BNB Chain scales up network as memecoin activity boosts transaction load F2B Broccoli community investigation questions score According to the official leaderboard, both tokens earned a daily score of 5.7 in a system where lower is better. Per competition rules, a tie is broken by comparing trading volume, and 714’s token had the edge in that category. Feb. 19 ranking for BNB Chain’s meme liquidity competition. Source: BNB Chain But an investigation conducted by the latter’s community now questions whether the 714 Broccoli token deserved the crown. In a video posted by the F2B community viewing the back-end data, their “BROCCOLI” token, with a token symbol in all caps, ranked first in its calculated daily score. Community members discovered their token ranked second publicly, even though it came first in back-end data. Source: F2B BROCCOLI community They then move to analyze the back-end data of the 714 Broccoli token (spelled without all caps), which had a daily score of 5.700000000000001 and ranked second. Rival Broccoli token ranked second in back-end data. Source: F2B BROCCOLI community The F2B community also attempted to calculate the scores themselves based on the formula cited by BNB Chain in a Feb. 14 blog post , and again in a Feb. 18 X post : “Score = (Market Cap Rank × 30%) + (24h Price Change Rank × 20%) + (24h Volume Rank × 50%)” Under that rubric, F2B appeared to have a clear edge — 5.5 points compared to 714’s 5.9 points. Related: BNB Chain flips Solana in daily fees, beats out all chains BNB Chain claims score is legit In a detailed response to the community inquiry shared with Cointelegraph, BNB Chain said that the community’s calculations relied on deprecated metrics. The actual scoring formula used by BNB Chain reflects: init_price_change_rank market_cap_rank acc_volume_rank The community’s calculation relied on the deprecated “percent_change_24h_rank” and “volume_24h_rank.” When recalculated under the updated formula, both tokens scored 5.7 — making the official tie-breaker (volume rank) valid, according to the network. BNB Chain said the deprecated dimensions were removed on Feb. 21 to “prevent miscalculations by the community.” BNB Chain said the community relied on metrics that aren’t part of the official ranking formula. Source: BNB Chain BNB Chain also dismissed concerns about the overly precise 5.70000001 score, saying it was simply a result of floating-point deviations caused by the IEEE 754 standard and held no reference value for the actual score. Despite the clarification, many in the F2B camp remain unconvinced, arguing that the rules lacked transparency and shifted mid-competition. Magazine: Bitcoiner sex trap extortion?

Incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins Speaks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Paul Atkins, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), recently addressed the Senate Banking Committee on March 27, calling for a clear and supportive framework for the cryptocurrency market. He said, “Since 2017, as I have led industry efforts to develop best practices for the digital asset industry, I have seen how ambiguous and non-existent regulations for digital assets create uncertainty in the market and inhibit innovation.” Atkins said that a top priority of his chairmanship will be to work with his fellow commissioners and Congress to provide a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets through a rational, coherent, and principled approach. He criticized outdated rules that block innovation and said vague policies have undermined investor confidence. Atkins vowed to create a framework that encourages growth, technology, and investor protection, aligning with Trump’s vision for global leadership in digital assets. “It is time for the SEC to return to its core mission that Congress set out for it: investor protection; fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and capital formation,” he added. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and current CEO of Patomak Global Partners, opened up about the need for regulatory clarity in the rapidly growing digital asset space. “I am eager to get to work for American markets and investors. Should I be confirmed, my goal will be to ensure that the United States is the best and most secure place in the world to do business and for Americans to invest their hard-earned dollars to save and provide for their future,” he explained.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 13:48:09

This reveals the extent to which cryptocurrency, particularly altcoins, is penetrating Korea’s public sector. Kim Hye-young, Seoul City councilor, has a portfolio of 1.7 billion won ($1.2 million) spread across 16 types of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Ripple’s XRP. The majority of her holdings are owned by her family members, with her husband owning 472 Dogecoin and 519,004 XRP, while her son owns 3,336 XRP . They also own Bitcoin and Ethereum, but in small amounts. This is an example of the most invested family in the Korean public sector, with family members included in the crypto count. Choi Min-gyu, Seoul City Councilor, the second biggest holder, has 1.62 billion won ($1 million) in crypto, including 409,551 XRP, 9,402 Arbitrum, and 4,701 Cardano. Kim Ki-hwan, CEO of Busan-Ulsan Expressway, the third largest holder, stands out with his preference for lesser-known altcoins. His holdings total 1.42 billion won ($969,000), including 152,251 Luna Classic, 5,979 Challenge docs, 1,989 Horus Pays, and 2,989 EOS Blacks. In January 2024, the new legislation was enacted, requiring all public officials to declare their crypto holdings, having been decided in May 2023 when the South Korean National Assembly passed the bill. The legislation resulted from a growing concern that public officials could hide large amounts of personal wealth, owned individually or by close family members, and that this wealth could be used to corrupt local governments. For this reason, public officials with a high ranking in government, designated with the category Grade 1, would have to declare their crypto portfolios, transaction records, and location where they initially bought their crypto. Altcoins are featured heavily in South Korean portfolios, with Ripple’s XRP often appearing, a crypto project focusing on remittances and institutional investors. Despite being major tokens, there was a noticeable absence of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which were not featured prominently. South Korea is renowned for its strict regulations on crypto trading. Despite such an environment, traders are still finding a way to build up their portfolios. The requirements for public officials to declare their holdings is just another example of strict regulations in South Korea. Conversely, the Lazarus group, backed by North Korea , conducted what has been described as the biggest exchange hack in crypto history. South Korea has recently cut down on unregistered overseas crypto exchanges operating in the country. The FIU has approached Google to ask for 17 such exchanges to be limited in advertising to Korean consumers. Further, in March, FIU pursued crypto operators who were not reporting their activities according to South Korean laws. The South Korean government seems to be cracking down on disorderly conduct within the crypto industry and is attempting to regulate the entire market with stricter rules. Given the crypto activities of North Korea, South Korea may be compensating for the lack of law and order with excessive crypto regulations.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|South Korea|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|ASIA|BTC|ETH|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-28 13:48:27

Amid this prediction, a new cryptocurrency is catching the attention of traders, offering them a promise of greater returns. In turn, investors are now looking into this new cryptocurrency which is promising gains of about 55 times their initial investment. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when it is being dominated by speculative trading. The rise of several meme coins, including PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows that projects can drive strong gains via strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement. The wider market sentiment also has a role to play in XYZVerse’s potential. As the Altcoin season is about to begin, investors have been moving their funds into meme coins with low market caps. Given that XYZVerse is still conducting its presale, it could benefit from some of these funds if it secures the needed exchange listings and maintains its community hype after launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencers partnerships to increase its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce the supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support the token’s stability after launch Community incentives (10%) will be given to the community to push engagement and holding. Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand rises and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? The token could witness a 30x rise from presale to $0.10 but it will depend on: Strong Exchange Listings – if XYZVerse is listed on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, and Binance, its price could see a big jump on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme Coins need viral momentum to support its rise. If XYZVerse secures the needed sports partnerships, it could help the project drive engagement on social media. Market Conditions – if Bitcoin and altcoins continue to see bullish momentums, assets like XYZVerse could benefit from it. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has what it takes for a strong launch to happen, but its success in the long term will depend on how the team behind the project executes it. If the team delivers big listings and real community engagement, the token could be on its way to the $0.10 target, which signifies a 3000% rise from its current price, making the feat achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Dogecoin Unleashed: How a Shiba Inu Took Over Crypto Dogecoin was launched in 2013 as a joke by two software engineers Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. The pair admitted that they created it for fun, using the Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, the token was created to be abundant, which means that its existence has no limit. According to the developers, 10,000 Shiba Inu coins are mined every minute. At first, people saw it as something like a joke, but in 2021, its value rose, changing things. At the time, it became one of the top 10 digital assets, with its worth rising to about $50 billion. This buzz it generated was fueled by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the support of its community, showing that internet culture is a thing in the financial market. Dogecoin was able to attract investors due to its simple and friendly image. The unending supply also makes it easy to trade and share. Some people also see it as the path to enter the market, with the project providing the needed fun in a world where most projects are serious. Unlike most tokens, the token is fueled by trends and online sentiment. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Dogecoin remains an important aspect of the sector. Its potential also depends on the community and how it adapts to new trends irrespective of what the market cycle is saying. Conclusion Though tokens like DOGE have shown potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) has stood out with its natural sports-themed meme coin aiming for a huge growth in the 2025 bull run.

This decline has shifted the attention of traders from ETH to Ethereum rivals that can record significant gains in price. Ethereum Price Crashes Below $2,000 Amid Weak Demand Ethereum price trades at $1,906 at press time, marking its lowest level in more than a week amid US PCE inflation . On the weekly chart, ETH had formed a triple-top pattern, which suggests that the price is about to make a sharp reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend. ETH price has been rejected again at the neckline of this triple top, which means that the bearish pressure is strong. If the downtrend progresses, it is possible that Ethereum will fall to $1,520. ETH/USD: 1-week Chart Besides the weak retail demand that is forcing Ethereum price to drop, institutions also appear uninterested in accumulating during the dip. Data from SoSoValue shows that spot ETH ETFs have experienced three weeks of persistent outflows. Amid these bearish headwinds, crypto traders are looking for the best Ethereum rivals that they can buy. Top 3 Ethereum Rivals to Buy The top 3 Ethereum rivals to buy after ETH price dropped below $2,000 include Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Ripple (XRP) The top Ethereum rival to buy today is XRP. This altcoin shows signs of outperforming ETH after the XRP/ETH ratio surged to its highest level since November 2020. Additionally, this ratio is at the upper Bollinger band, which further suggests a bullish outlook, which could cause a breakout to the all-time high price of 0.0036. XRP/ETH: 1-week chart Besides this rising ratio, other factors suggest that XRP can outperform ETH . XRP is at a pivotal point after the Ripple lawsuit was dismissed. The Ripple army is optimistic that the end of the case will attract interest from institutions through spot ETFs. On Polymarket, the odds of an XRP ETF being approved by the end of the year have soared to 85%. Solana (SOL) Solana is another Ethereum rival to buy for significant gains. Just like XRP, Solana has outperformed ETH in recent months, with catalysts like a spot ETF application by Fidelity and adoption by BlackRock for the BUIDL fund set to drive further gains. The daily price chart shows a looming Solana bullish breakout that could lead to gains. This happened after SOL touched resistance at the upper trendline of a falling parallel pattern. If the MACD line crosses above the zero line to confirm a bullish momentum, it could lead to SOL escaping this bearish pattern. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Cardano (ADA) The other Ethereum rival that traders should consider buying today for significant gains is Cardano. The Cardano network is recording a significant uptick in global adoption after TapTools revealed that it has surpassed 5.25 million wallets. Cardano price is currently trading within a consolidation range. However, the AO is rising, suggesting that bulls might regain control. If buyers break ADA price from this consolidation zone, it might spark a rally towards the 161.8% Fibonacci level of $1.54. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Final Thoughts on Ethereum Rivals to Buy Ethereum price has dropped below the critical support level of $2,000, suggesting that bearish headwinds might push the price down further. Amid this drop, the top Ethereum rivals that traders can buy today include XRP, Solana, and Cardano.

After a brutal downtrend that had almost every holder underwater, TON is making a comeback. This comes in when VCs dropped $400 million into Toncoin while it was struggling to keep up. The global digital assets market cap dropped by more than 3% over the last day to stand at $2.76 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume jumped by 19% to hit $90 billion, suggesting that traders are moving and dumping as sentiments turn bearish. On the other hand, Toncoin managed to gain by around 4% in the last 24 hours. TON defies the slump As per the data shared by IntoTheBlock, TON turned out to be one of the biggest gainers of the day after rebounding from a prolonged downtrend. The recent plunge had left nearly 100% of TON holders at a loss in early March, meanwhile, with the steady upswing 10% of its holders are back in profit. It added that this resurgence coincides with a major outflow recorded. Around 1.1 million Toncoin left exchanges over the last day. It is an indication that whales are back at accumulation game. 1/ TON is one of the few tokens in the green today, rebounding from a prolonged downtrend that left nearly 100% of holders at a loss in early March. Its steady upswing now has roughly 10% of holders back in profit. pic.twitter.com/zcWXmoFLkE — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 28, 2025 TON price has jumped by over 12% in the last 7 days, while top cryptos like XRP and Ethereum have reported red indexes. TON is trading at an average price of $4.02 at the press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up a whooping 76% to stand at $401 million. But, it is still down by 51% from its all-time high (ATH) of $8.24, recorded on June 15, 2024. Pavel Durov’s TON bet is paying off Pavel Durov, CEO of Telegram, recently announced that March comes to be a good month for The Open Network as the biggest names in venture capital invested over $400M into TON . This includes Sequoia, Benchmark, Ribbit, Draper, VY, and others. He mentioned that the TON has become the backbone of the creator economy on Telegram over the past year. The app acts as an exclusive withdrawal method for millions of content creators and mini-app developers. It is also the only way to pay for Telegram Ads in most countries. Coinglass data shows that around $1.73 million worth of long and short bets set on Toncoin price action got liquidated in the past 24 hours. $1.07 million worth of liquidated position (62%) turned out to be short bets. This suggests that traders were expecting the TON price to continue its decline, but fresh bullish activities helped it surge against the will. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Once a darling of the meme currency fever, DOGE's reliance on social media attention and intermittent endorsements—like Elon Musk's lighthearted nods via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—hasn't translated into consistent increase. Its unlimited supply and lack of inherent value still pull it down, and analysts doubt its capacity to veer from this path without a significant change in principles. For now, Dogecoin seems destined to stay imprisoned by its hype-driven volatility, caught below $0.30. Enter Rexas Finance (RXS), a $0.20 DeFi token silently positioned as a breakthrough star with sights set on an astonishing $23 price. Rexas Finance offers a game-changing strategy unlike the speculative appeal of Dogecoin: tokenization of actual assets. This creative approach exposes investors to affluent markets by removing conventional financial constraints. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Token Delivering Impressive Returns Early investors of Rexas Finance (RXS) enjoyed an outstanding 6.67x ROI. This remarkable increase indicates great market trust because of rising adoption and the platform's real-world asset tokenizing approach. Being a DeFi powerhouse, RXS presents real financial solutions that investors quickly adopt rather than only speculative trading. Tokenizing allows Rexas Finance to improve accessibility. Through digitalizing gold ownership, RXS offers investors a safe and liquid approach to trading a market valued at $121.2 trillion free from conventional obstacles. Enable fractional ownership of assets, including real estate, commodities, and more, to link investors between the physical and digital financial worlds. This utility-driven idea and deflationary tokenomics structure differentiate it from DOGE's inflationary maze. It promises long-term value preservation and growth. Unlike Dogecoin, which has struggled to keep momentum, RXS is seeing a surge in adoption driven by real-world demand. Rexas Finance is not only talk; it is already delivering results. With over $47.2 million raised in its presale phases, the project has built a solid foundation and a growing community buzzing with expectation for its exchange debut. This level of investor faith in the project's long-term potential indicates strength. Rexas Finance could be a 100x contender because of its DeFi innovations, such as its cross-chain treasury platform and yield optimization tools, which appeal to savvy investors. Its ability to create passive income through optimal yield farming and staking mechanisms, which appeal to more institutional and retail investors searching for long-term opportunities, also makes it appealing. While Dogecoin suffers under the weight of its meme reputation, Rexas Finance is charting a course toward explosive gains with real-world relevance at its core. Dogecoin's infinite supply model continues to dilute its value, making it difficult for the token to sustain meaningful price appreciation. In contrast, RXS uses a deflationary mechanism that enhances scarcity, driving long-term development. Moreover, Dogecoin's dependence on social media sponsorships has shown erratic behavior. Once a primary factor causing DOGE's price spikes, Musk's sponsorships have lost their influence and caused stagnation. As RXS develops utility outside of hype, it establishes itself as a DeFi revolution pillar. Rexas Finance offers a ground-floor prospect for $0.20 in a market ravenous for substance over hype. Asset tokenization, DeFi utility, and investor confidence are creating conditions for an explosive rise. Given its present course and the approaching bull run, analysts estimate Rexas Finance might reach $23, providing early adopters with giant gains. The decision for investors looking for exponential gains is obvious as Dogecoin struggles to recover prior highs while RXS seems set for a breakout. This DeFi gem might bury DOGE as the next bull run looms, demonstrating that utility—not just memes—is the secret to crypto's future. Conclusion The stalling of Dogecoin draws attention to the limits of hype-driven investments, especially in a changing crypto scene where utility is progressively deciding success. Rexas Finance is gathering steam with its innovative approach to asset tokenization as DOGE stays anchored below $0.30. Strong market positioning, institutional interest, and concrete use cases indicate that RXS is ready for explosive expansion. Investors searching for the next great prospect should pay special attention since Rexas Finance might be the coin that redefines DeFi in the following years.

Check out the most recent developments in the Ripple environment. Ripple secures additional support The firm’s native cryptocurrency has become the subject of renewed support from various cryptocurrency exchanges ever since Ripple’s partial court win against the US SEC in the summer of 2023. Some of the platforms re-listing XRP in the past few years include Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com, Gemini, and more. Earlier this week, the well-known brokerage firm – Interactive Brokers – also enabled trading services with the asset. In addition to XRP, the company also embraced Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA). The lawsuit is over As mentioned above, the legal tussle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reached a pivotal point in 2023. In the following years, the company secured additional court victories before finally triumphing earlier this month. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced in mid-March that the SEC had dropped its appeal, describing the effort as the official end of the lawsuit. Some legal experts, though, reminded that the company was previously slammed with a $125 million fine, and the battle will not conclude until it settles the amount or appeals the ruling. Earlier this week, the chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the firm will withdraw its cross-appeal and pay a penalty of $50 million (instead of the previously ruled $125 million), potentially marking the case’s final resolution. The $50 million is already in an interest-bearing account, while the remaining amount will be returned to Ripple, he said. ETF to follow next? With the legal battle seemingly already in history, all eyes are now on the potential launch of a spot XRP ETF in the United States. The renowned companies that have displayed their intentions to introduce such a product include Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and more. Meanwhile, Nate Geraci, a well-regarded ETF analyst, believes BlackRock and Fidelity may also join the race to become the first entity to introduce that type of investment vehicle in America. “ Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval simply matter of time IMO . And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc to all be involved,” he recently said. According to Polymarket, the odds of such a product to see the light of day before 2025 stand at around 85%. Ripple’s integration As CryptoPotato reported , the company recently integrated the new oracle service platform – Lumina – into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to enhance data transparency across DeFi, real-world assets (RWAs), and Web3 applications. Built on the Decentralized Information Asset framework, Lumina went live on March 26 and aims to replace traditional “black-box” oracles with fully on-chain infrastructure. The platform’s core engine is Lasernet, a layer-2 rollup built on Arbitrum and Ethereum, designed to deliver fully transparent and verifiable oracle data. Ripple sees this setup as essential for advancing the real-world assets (RWA) space, moving away from the systems used by oracles like Chainlink and Pyth. XRP price predictions XRP recorded a solid (yet quite brief) price spike following Garlinghouse’s disclosure. Since then, it experienced enhanced volatility and eventually plunged to the current $2.22. Some market observers believe the asset could resume its bull run, but such progress would depend on certain factors. The popular X user Ali Martinez thinks XRP needs to surge past $3 to “invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially flipping the outlook bullish.” Dark Defender is among the biggest optimists. The analyst suggested that Ripple’s cross-border token has formed “a great bullish rectangle pattern,” hovering between $1.90 and almost $3.40 in the last several months. “The consolidation will be over very soon. The next leg will welcome new all-time highs,” they forecasted.

As a newly launched token, it is often in the limelight, especially as the former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao showed support for this meme-themed cryptocurrency. As a result, its price saw many uptrends, but today, it is different as it is down by 40%. Why? Let’s discuss this. Mubarak Meme Coin Price Crashes With Binance Listing Binance recently listed four cryptocurrencies, including Mubarak. Although it was expected, the Mubarak meme coin price crash came unexpectedly. Experts believe this happened as the sellers were prepared to benefit from the potential rally. Although the token did witness a rally at first, hitting $0.011, it soon crashed amid seller’s activity. At present, it trades at $0.08652 after bearing a 40% loss today and 60% away from the ATH of $0.2158, set ten days ago. Interestingly, when this token plummeted, the three other listed tokens, i.e., BROCCOLI, TUT, and BANANAS31, had significant uptrends, disappointing investors. Crypto Whales to Blame For Mubarak Crash Talking of the Mubarak coin price crash, the 205% surge in the trading volume reveals that the investors’ activity is high. A significant portion of this is from the crypto whales, which are on a selling spree and fueling this crash. Lookonchain X’s post revealed one such whale who had deposited 6.14M Mubarak earlier in the day. Interestingly, the whale itself made nearly $760k in profits, but the activity resulted in increasing the selling pressure on the token. Another whale has deposited 10.28M Mubarak on Binance and sold it at a loss. Experts claim such sell-offs are made voluntarily to bring the token down before fueling a price reversal. Experts Predict Mubarak Meme Coin Price to Surge 5x According to crypto experts, Changpeng Zhao’s connection to Mubarak will bring price rallies. One such claim is that even though the initial outcome of the Binance listing turned into correction, it is up for a 5x surge due to historical trends and upcoming Eid Mubarak celebrations. Another pointed out a potential breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern. He claimed that the bull’s presence would push its price above key resistances before predicting a Mubarak meme coin price rally to $0.17. However, the ongoing bearish trend is hard to ignore, where the key resistance is at $0.14 and $0.16. More importantly, the RSI, MACD, and key moving average indicate a bearish momentum. Investors must keep an eye on the performance, as its key support is $0.086. A bounce from this could bring an uptrend. In contrast, a drop can push it toward $0.08.

NFT sales plunge 63% in Q1, but Pudgy Penguins, Doodles buck trend Sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2025 , plunging 63% year-over-year. Still, a few standout collections defied the downturn and posted gains. NFTs recorded $1.5 billion in total sales from January to March 2025, down from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2024, according to data from aggregator CryptoSlam. March accounted for the steepest decline, with sales falling 76% to $373 million compared with $1.6 billion last year. Despite the slowdown, collections including Doodles, Milady Maker and Pudgy Penguins outperformed expectations, showing strength amid the downturn. Among the largest NFT collections, CryptoPunks recorded $60 million in Q1 2025 sales, down 47% from $114 million in the first quarter of 2024. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had an even bigger drop of 61%. The monkey-themed NFT collection had a sales volume of only $29.8 million in Q1 2025, down from $78 million in Q1 2024. Crypto.com probe by the SEC has officially closed, says CEO The US Securities and Exchange Commission has officially closed its investigation into Crypto.com , with no action taken against the crypto exchange, according to the firm’s CEO, Kris Marszalek. ”They used every tool available to attempt to stifle us, restricting access to banking, auditors, investors, and beyond. It was a calculated attempt to put an end to the industry,” Marszalek said in a March 27 X post. Source: Kris Marszalek The SEC also dismissed its civil enforcement action against crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW with prejudice on March 27. Prospective SEC chair pressed on sale of FTX-tied firm Lawmakers in the US Senate Banking Committee questioned prospective Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Paul Atkins on his ties to the crypto industry and how he might regulate digital assets if confirmed. Questioning Atkins at his nomination hearing on March 27, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the committee’s ranking member, said the former SEC commissioner had had “staggeringly bad judgment” in his role leading up to the 2008 financial crisis — Atkins served at the agency from 2002 to 2008. Sen. Warren also asked Atkins to disclose the buyers of his consulting firm Patomak Global Partners — which advised crypto exchange FTX before its collapse in 2022 — for transparency about potential conflicts of interest with the digital asset industry. “Your clients pay you north of $1,200 an hour for advice on how to influence regulators like the SEC, and if you’re confirmed, you will be in a prime spot to deliver for all those clients who’ve been paying you millions of dollars for years,” said Sen. Warren, suggesting Atkins’ judgment “will be influenced by more than an objective assessment of the data.” Paul Atkins addressing lawmakers at March 27 nomination hearing. Source: US Senate Banking Committee The Massachusetts senator sent a letter to Donald Trump’s SEC pick on March 23, calling on him to be prepared to answer questions related to his potential role at the agency based on his ties to the crypto industry through Patomak. At the March 27 hearing, Sen. Warren asked Atkins to disclose the consulting firm’s potential buyers — he said he planned to sell the company if confirmed — who might be “buying access to the future chair of the SEC.” Atkins said he would “abide by the process” but did not directly answer Sen.

42531735,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-now-amid-chatgpt-ghibli-art-craze-5-new-meme-coins,1743170353,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42531735.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now Amid ChatGPT Ghibli Art Craze: 5 New Meme Coins,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/best-crypto-to-buy-now-amid-chatgpt-ghibli-art-craze-5-new-meme-coins,"Major developments within any global topic—politics, economy, or even AI—often have a strong effect on cryptocurrencies. While some may be much more impactful, others too manage to pave the way for considerable price movements. The latest such development was ChatGPT’s newest model release, which allows users to create Studio Ghibli-style artwork from their own images. As with any other breaking news, this also resulted in a huge number of new meme coins getting launched. Our experts have compiled a list of trending tokens that may gain considerable demand—especially since investor interest will now be on meme coins that can fetch excellent profits in the short term. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Meme Coins that May Pump BTC Bull The surge in AI-generated Ghibli-style art has already sent meme communities into overdrive, but BTC Bull lands in a particularly sweet spot. It combines two things the crypto market loves: culturally charged memes and direct exposure to the front-runner of digital assets—Bitcoin. This particular identity gives BTC Bull a natural edge during hype-driven movements. As AI-powered creativity brings in attention, tokens that tie into broader themes like BTC tend to benefit by association. It gives the average trader a way to play Bitcoin’s story without the $90k+ buy-in—and with the added benefit of community-based movement. But this isn’t just a sticker slapped on a token. BTC Bull’s design includes milestone-based airdrops that unlock as the project gains traction. Every growth push by the community feeds into direct rewards. Pair that with a deflationary burn model, and you have a system where scarcity builds in real-time, amplifying upside when demand spikes. The token also has one trait most meme coins lack: structure. Thanks to all these elements, it has already been featured by top crypto YouTubers and analysts in the space. 99Bitcoins claimed that the project had high potential in one of its dedicated videos. The project has already seen considerable demand, but with such a development within the crypto space in terms of meme coins, this demand is only likely to soar further. It doesn’t have to pivot to match the moment—it’s already built to ride waves just like this one. Meme Index AI-generated Ghibli art isn’t just a trend, but rather a content avalanche. And Meme Index , by its very nature, thrives in these high-noise, high-speed environments. As new meme coins based on Ghibli, anime, AI, and ChatGPT explode across DEX listings, Meme Index is set up to absorb their value, not chase them individually. That’s because it’s not a single coin. The project features a rotating, curated basket of trending meme tokens, designed to adapt as attention moves from one theme to the next. If Ghibli-inspired tokens take off and build real traction, chances are the strongest among them end up inside Meme Index, giving holders exposure without micromanaging picks. But this isn’t a passive ETF. The index is actively managed through on-chain metrics, social engagement tracking, and performance filters. Tokens that gain real momentum get weighted accordingly. Tokens that fade get swapped out. In short, it behaves like a meme-native hedge fund—fast-moving, adaptable, and responsive to shifts in online behavior. As more AI-driven content hits the web, and as meme creators jump on the Ghibli hype, the pipeline of new relevant tokens will grow. Meme Index benefits from that stream by integrating what works, and discarding what doesn’t—automatically. There’s also the long game: if meme cycles continue expanding in complexity, Meme Index could end up functioning as more than exposure—it could become a revenue model. Returns grow as underlying tokens grow, meaning the index might not just follow pumps, but compound them. MIND of Pepe While the AI update hit like a flash, MIND of Pepe managed to be perfectly positioned to capitalize—not just as a meme, but as a tool in tune with the very technology driving the hype. MIND of Pepe uses AI to scan the crypto community in real time—forums, socials, trading rooms—to detect which tokens are being talked about most, where sentiment is shifting, and what narratives are just beginning to form. In moments like this, when a cultural shift (like AI-generated Ghibli art) starts bleeding into token launches, MIND of Pepe doesn’t just react—it spots the trend as it’s forming. That makes it more than a meme token riding waves. It’s a sentiment engine built for meme coin traders who want more than guesswork. When a dozen Ghibli or AI-related tokens appear overnight, most people have to watch volume charts or Twitter mentions to decide what’s hot. MIND of Pepe’s AI already has that mapped. Checkmate. $MIND pic.twitter.com/MBTietcBKE — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 22, 2025 The utility is built right into the token. Holders gain access to trend signals, early alerts, and social heat tracking—tools that are incredibly useful when new categories of coins launch fast and disappear faster. It’s the kind of support system meme coin traders often need, but rarely have. At the time of writing, it has managed to raise more than $7.6 million, which in itself is an impressive feat. It’s also self-aware. The branding—Pepe—grounds it in familiar territory, ensuring visibility across meme communities. But the layer underneath is all AI, all signal. In a moment where content is driving creativity and new tokens are popping up by the hour, MIND of Pepe offers an edge. It doesn’t try to out-hype the market—it’s just better at keeping up with where the next wave might be heading. Solaxy The art-related ChatGPT feature might seem worlds apart from blockchain infrastructure—but trends like these always push one key thing: activity. And when activity surges—across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain—users start noticing how clunky the cross-chain experience still is. That’s where Solaxy steps forward. Solaxy operates beneath the noise. While Ghibli-themed meme tokens soar and swap volume spikes, Solaxy keeps chains connected and movement seamless. It’s a Layer 2 protocol built for real use: faster bridges, low-cost transfers, and effortless interaction between Ethereum and Solana—two ecosystems that house the bulk of meme launches right now. The AI meme boom is also creating chaos: new tokens launching across different chains, traders scrambling to move capital to catch each pump. Without the right tools, they’re stuck paying high gas fees, waiting on slow bridges, or simply missing out. Solaxy’s infrastructure removes those barriers, making movement smooth when speed matters most. Beyond utility, Solaxy offers yield. Stakers who support the network are rewarded, creating an incentive layer that complements the tech. That’s important—not just for investor confidence, but for building an actual community that isn’t only here for speculation. As AI-related content like Ghibli-style memes continues spawning tokens on multiple chains, platforms that simplify participation will quietly gain ground. With over $28 million raised, this presale already shows potential for 10x returns or more. Catslap The Ghibli-style art surge has opened the door to a new kind of meme expression—wholesome, animated, and absurd in just the right way. And in that creative space, Catslap fits right in. It’s quirky, instantly recognizable, and carries a meme aesthetic that feels tailor-made for this exact cultural moment. Catslap claims to be all about simplicity. A slapping cat, lifted from internet lore and injected with meme coin energy. But what gives it legs now is timing. As the Ghibli wave floods social media, projects with bold, expressive visual identities are more likely to catch attention—and Catslap already has that baked in. I didn't hear no bell.Rule 1 of Slap Squad is you never back down. 🐱 pic.twitter.com/n6b6EsQqQY — Catslap (@CatSlapToken) February 16, 2025 After its early price spike, the token underwent a sharp correction but didn’t disappear. The team has kept the community engaged, teasing future gamified elements while letting the meme culture do its thing. That gives Catslap room to build again, especially as interest shifts toward visually rich, meme-aligned tokens. What’s more, it doesn’t require deep explanation. It’s a coin you feel instantly—there’s no barrier to entry. If the Ghibli-inspired content trend continues—and it likely will—Catslap could ride that wave with minimal effort. Conclusion AI trends don’t stay in their lanes. What starts as a viral tool—like Ghibli-style image generation—quickly turns into a cultural ripple. Crypto catches that energy fast, and when it does, meme coins become vehicles for expression, speculation, and profit. But not all tokens are built to last through the noise. Some are just reactions. The ones listed above, though—those could be considered comparatively better-structured plays, and therefore, options worth considering.

The funds were traced to wallets allegedly used for crypto fundraising and money laundering operations by the organization, which is designated as a terrorist entity by both the U.S. and the European Union. Crypto Fundraising Under Scrutiny According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Hamas supporters worldwide contributed more than $1.5 million in cryptocurrency since October 2024. These funds were funneled through multiple exchange accounts and wallets promoted in online group chats claiming affiliation with Hamas. Authorities believe that these donations were subsequently laundered through a series of transactions. U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. of the District of Columbia said, “These seizures show that this office will search high and low for every cent of money going to fund Hamas, wherever it is found, and in whatever form of currency. Hamas is responsible for the death of many U.S. and Israeli nationals, and we will stop at nothing to stop their campaign of terror and murder.” Seized Assets and Identified Accounts The confiscated funds include approximately $90,000 held in various wallets and another $112,000 in three exchange accounts. According to the FBI, these exchange accounts were registered to Palestinian individuals based in Turkey and other locations. Authorities did not disclose the names of the individuals or the platforms used to process these transactions. Past Legal Challenges and Regulatory Concerns Hamas' use of cryptocurrency for fundraising has been under investigation for years. In January 2024, a lawsuit was filed against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao, alleging that the exchange facilitated Hamas' crypto fundraising efforts. The case, brought by families of victims of Hamas attacks in Israel, accused Binance of failing to implement adequate anti-money laundering measures. While Binance has denied any direct involvement with Hamas, the company has faced multiple legal battles over compliance issues. In November 2023, the exchange reached a $4.3 billion settlement with the DOJ over alleged violations of anti-money laundering regulations. Growing Concerns Over Crypto in Terror Financing A December 2024 report by the Congressional Research Service indicated that Hamas has been soliciting cryptocurrency donations since at least 2019. However, the effectiveness and scale of these efforts remain uncertain. U.S. officials have increasingly voiced concerns about terrorist organizations leveraging digital assets, with some calling for stricter oversight and regulation of the crypto industry to curb illicit financial activities. Despite these concerns, research from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis suggests that cryptocurrency-based terrorism financing constitutes a minimal fraction of overall crypto transactions. Traditional fiat-based methods continue to be the primary financial channels for such organizations. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Gelato, which previously developed blockchain solutions for companies such as Kraken and Animoca Brands, unveiled the new upgrade that aims to let developers deploy fully sovereign chains faster and cheaper with full interoperability via Avalanche InterChain Messaging (ICM). Gelato emphasized that its service is ideal for advanced applications such as financial technology (fintech) requiring identity verification (KYC) and specialized gaming economies, according to a March 28 announcement shared exclusively with Cointelegraph. The service lets companies quickly deploy independent (“sovereign”) blockchains with fewer costs and faster launch times. Luis Schliesske, founder of Gelato, said previously launching a blockchain required extensive technical knowledge and significant engineering resources. Gelato’s new product reduces the complexity involved. He told Cointelegraph: “Gelato’s RaaS on Avalanche streamlines everything from deployment and upgrades to real-time monitoring and scaling. It’s a plug-and-play solution that slashes time-to-market and operational burden bringing AWS-level infrastructure to the rollup era.” “The future of enterprise blockchain is sovereign, interoperable, and invisible to the end-user,” he added. Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETP ‘key’ for EU adoption despite low inflow expectations The new solution will enable one-click layer-1 (L1) network deployment on Avalanche and leverage key network advancements such as dynamic fees and the removal of the Avalanche ( AVAX ) token staking requirements. “Avalanche L1s mark a paradigm shift in blockchain infrastructure, enabling a future where every application can run on its own sovereign chain, optimized for its unique needs,” according to Martin Eckardt, senior director of developer relations at Ava Labs.

However, financial institutions need more robust infrastructure to have the confidence to adopt blockchain and more crypto offerings, Schliesske said, adding: “Institutions will not build on crypto infrastructure that feels experimental or unreliable. [...] That reliability is a prerequisite for onboarding financial institutions, governments, and large enterprises.” Fox News and eBay are some of the most prominent brands that have launched blockchain-based solutions on Gelato’s development platform.

Since March 19, ETH has managed to hold above $1,930, but recent weakness has pushed the price dangerously close to breaking below the $1,900 mark. The drop has added fuel to bearish speculation, with traders and analysts now questioning whether a larger pullback is underway. Related Reading: Avalanche 12-Hour TD Sequential Flashes Sell Signal After Nailing 50% Rally – Details The inability to hold above psychological support levels has weighed heavily on sentiment, especially as broader market volatility continues to grow. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared his outlook on Ethereum’s current structure, noting that the asset has repeatedly failed to overcome resistance at $2,100 — a level that now acts as a firm ceiling for bullish momentum. According to Runefelt, this repeated rejection suggests Ethereum could be in serious trouble if buyers don’t step in soon. With momentum fading and no clear catalyst in sight, Ethereum risks slipping further if $1,900 fails to hold. Traders are watching closely for signs of a reversal, but for now, the path of least resistance appears to be downward. ETH must regain lost levels quickly to avoid confirming a broader bearish trend. Bulls Face Key Test As Resistance Weighs on Price Action Ethereum is under pressure as the broader crypto market faces one of its most crucial tests in months. With macroeconomic uncertainty mounting and fears of a potential recession in the United States, risk assets across the board are struggling to gain traction — and Ethereum is no exception. The current market environment remains hostile, with inflation concerns, unstable monetary policy, and global trade tensions shaking investor confidence. ETH’s price action has been particularly underwhelming. Despite widespread expectations that Ethereum would lead a strong rally in early 2025, the asset has failed to meet bullish projections. Instead of gaining ground, ETH has stalled and is now struggling to hold support levels amid growing selling pressure. Runefelt’s bearish outlook suggests that Ethereum has repeatedly failed to break through the $2,100 resistance level. According to Runefelt, this resistance zone is critical — and Ethereum’s inability to overcome it could be a sign of deeper weakness ahead. He warns that if Bitcoin experiences a breakdown, Ethereum could follow and potentially retest the wick near $1,750, which marked a local low during a previous correction. With momentum fading and no clear bullish catalyst in sight, Ethereum’s price structure remains fragile. Unless bulls reclaim key levels soon, ETH could face a deeper retrace, especially if broader market sentiment continues to deteriorate. Traders are closely watching Bitcoin and macroeconomic developments for cues, knowing that a decisive move in either direction could shape Ethereum’s next major trend. For now, the pressure is on — and Ethereum’s resilience is about to be tested. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Has Surged 36% In Two Weeks – Is Momentum Building? ETH Bulls Struggle to Hold Key Support Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $1,910 after failing to hold above the critical $2,000 level, a psychological and technical barrier that has now flipped into resistance. The breakdown has weakened short-term momentum and left bulls in a defensive position as selling pressure continues to mount. At this stage, the $1,880 level has emerged as a key support zone that bulls must defend to avoid a deeper correction. Holding this level could allow for a consolidation phase and give Ethereum a chance to stabilize before attempting another push higher. However, if ETH loses $1,880, it could spark a wave of aggressive selling, triggering a continuation of the current downtrend and potentially pushing the price toward the $1,750 range. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Realized Price – Bulls Face Strong Resistance At $2,300 To regain control of the trend, bulls must reclaim the $2,000 mark as soon as possible. A decisive move back above this level would signal renewed strength and could open the door for a rebound toward higher resistance zones. Until then, Ethereum remains in a fragile position, with the risk of further downside growing as macroeconomic pressure and technical weakness continue to weigh on price action.

As originally reported by the Khaleej Times, the Central Bank of the UAE will issue the digital version of the country’s national currency AED for the retail sector in the last quarter of 2025. The Digital Dirham CBDC will be accepted across all payment channels alongside physical currency and will be accessible through licensed financial institutions, including banks, exchange houses, and fintech firms. It will feature high security, tokenization, and smart contract integration, enabling instant settlements and multi-party transactions. Additionally, CBUAE has developed an integrated Digital Dirham platform and wallet, which enable retail, wholesale, and cross-border transactions. The news follows a rebranding of the Digital Dirham , with its first letter now serving as the international symbol.

This triggered several major initiatives, including a push from Tether ( USDT ) to issue AED-backed tokens. However, the Digital Dirham CBDC marks a key evolution, one that goes beyond private-sector stablecoins. As a sovereign-backed digital currency, it provides a higher level of security, regulatory oversight, and monetary authority than privately issued tokens. In the CBDC space, the UAE has partnered with other countries, like Saudi Arabia, in the “Aber” project , a joint CBDC initiative between the two nations to explore cross-border payments using digital currencies. Currently, the UAE is in the testing and development phase of its Digital Dirham, alongside a growing number of countries that are also running pilot programs of their own CBDCs, including Russia , China , Sweden , Korea , Brazil , and the United Kingdom , to name a few.

Sun becomes the second Chinese entrepreneur, after Jack Ma, and the fourth crypto exchange figure, following CZ, SBF, and Brian Armstrong, to achieve this prestigious recognition. Forbes profiles Sun as a “ Crypto Billionaire Who Helped The Trumps Make $400 Million ,” highlighting his distinct influence and global vision. Sun’s Crypto Empire: From Disruptor to Industry Leader The Forbes feature portrays Sun as a figure of “youth, controversy, and immense wealth.” Born in 1990, Sun has built a reputation for bold, unconventional moves within the blockchain space. “In my 20s, I was just trying everything, ” Sun shares, illustrating his hands-on, entrepreneurial approach to innovation. Over the past decade, Sun has developed a comprehensive crypto ecosystem encompassing public chains, payment networks, exchanges, and decentralized finance (DeFi). His flagship project, TRON, ranks among the fastest-growing blockchain networks in the world, with over 300 million users and daily transaction volumes exceeding ten million. This achievement underscores his vision for a “global payment system” and reflects the increasing mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies. As Global Advisor of HTX, Sun has helped steer the exchange to new heights. HTX was recently recognized by Forbes as one of the “Top 25 World’s Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges of 2025”. Under Sun’s leadership, HTX has championed compliance, security, and user experience, setting a benchmark for the convergence of traditional finance and crypto innovation. The synergy between HTX and TRON, facilitated by Sun’s strategic guidance, is driving seamless resource integration through technological interoperability. Forbes Cover Recognition: A Testament to Global Leadership Sun’s appearance on the Forbes cover underscores his growing influence on the global crypto stage. He joins a short list of visionary leaders from the crypto exchange world, alongside CZ, SBF, and Brian Armstrong, who have earned this recognition. In a post on X, Sun remarked, “From a visionary to a global force — honored to be featured on Forbes as Crypto’s Billionaire Barker.” Previously, Forbes Portugal included Sun in its “40 Notable Blockchain Entrepreneurs to Watch” list, where he ranked second—only behind Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Notably, Sun was the only Chinese entrepreneur in the top three, representing the highest placement ever for a Chinese figure in a global blockchain ranking. Forbes has also consistently named Sun in its “30 Under 30 Asia” lists and has noted his wide-ranging interests, including art collection, gaming, investment, philanthropy, and space exploration. In late 2024, Justin was appointed as Prime Minister of the Republic of Liberland, aiming to redefine the crypto space with principles of freedom and innovation. Strategic Collaborations and Industry Mission: Mainstreaming Crypto The Forbes article also highlights Sun’s collaboration with the Trump family, a partnership that reportedly generated over $400 million. His $75 million investment in the Trumps’ World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project demonstrates how crypto can be strategically deployed to integrate with mainstream business initiatives. This bold move showcases Sun’s ability to identify emerging trends and leverage blockchain across cultural IP, social media, and digital asset markets. Addressing the industry’s volatility and credibility challenges, Sun emphasizes the importance of a “long-term vision” in his Forbes interview. Both HTX and TRON now prioritize transparency, open-source development, and community governance. Sun’s appearance on the Forbes cover signals not only personal success but the rising global influence of crypto innovation. Through HTX and TRON, Sun is helping bridge the gap between traditional finance and Web3, accelerating the shift toward a transparent, efficient, and inclusive digital economy. As Forbes concludes, “This Eastern crypto pioneer is redefining global rules with code and consensus.” About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses.

This shows a strong interest in the COTI community and its activities, especially future opportunities for airdrop distribution and participation. This reflects the increasing participation in the crypto space, especially among new users. Walrus (WAL): After many exchanges listed WAL, it became a hot topic among investors. Curve Finance (CRV): Discussions around CRV center around recent price action, including a remarkable 58% rally.

Despite rapid progress, many Web3 and emerging tech projects remain complex and unfamiliar to the broader market, making a strong PR strategy essential. A well-executed PR strategy is crucial for effectively conveying a company’s mission and projects to a wider audience, including communities and investors while navigating an increasingly competitive and fast-evolving market. For companies and innovators, partnering with a PR agency that deeply understands the technology and can translate complex concepts into clear, compelling narratives is crucial. The best agencies in Web3 and emerging tech aren’t just skilled in traditional PR; they are agile, forward-thinking, and adept at navigating the unique challenges of these dynamic industries.

Binance stated that these tokens will have Seed Tags applied to them and will be available for trading starting at 00:00 (UTC+3) on March 28, 2025. However, the Binance listing had an adverse effect on the MUBARAK price, and the MUBARAK price dropped by 40% in the last 24 hours. Experts state that the decline in the price of MUBARAK, despite its listing on Binance, is due to sales. Since its first day of release, MUBARAK has reached $0.21 with the support of CZ. Investors who want to evaluate this rise seem to have started selling. According to Lookonchain's post, an investor spent $2,861 to buy 6.14 million MUBARAK on March 13. Following the Binance listing news, he deposited his MUBARAKs to Binance and made a profit of $760,000. However, this investor who missed the peak would have made a profit of $1.3 million if he had sold at the peak. MUBARAK continues to trade at $0.084, down 40% at the time of writing. This trader spent $2,861 to buy 6.14M $MUBARAK on March 13 and deposited it to #Binance 7 hours ago, making a ~$760K profit. But at its peak, the 6.14M $MUBARAK was worth $1.3M—meaning he missed out on ~$540K in additional gains. https://t.co/XzSWIeLXP8 pic.twitter.com/2JZ9R5PjH7 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 28, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

You’re not alone. Just this month, analysts pointed out that meme coins with strong communities and utility are staging a wild comeback, defying bearish pressure and turning heads across the globe. Add to that a growing trend of crypto gamers and Gen Z investors piling into presales, and it’s clear: this isn’t your usual bull run, mate. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With its explosive presale, jaw-dropping 2900% ROI potential, and a limited-time 100% bonus offer ending March 30, this meme beast is making waves across Telegram and TikTok alike. It’s more than hype—it’s a movement. Whether you’re chasing gains, passive income, or a chance to build your own crypto crew, BTFD is handing it all to you on a silver platter. Keep reading and see why BTFD and these other coin are causing a stampede being the best cryptos to buy in 2025. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin Presale With 2900% Upside and a Limited Bonus What if one meme coin combined staking, gaming, and killer community energy—while letting you double your tokens right now? That coin’s here, and it’s called BTFD. Born from the mantra “ Buy The Dip ,” BTFD is more than a punchline. It’s a thriving Ethereum-based project with a fully live Play-to-Earn game, staking at 90% APY, and a high-octane referral program. The current price sits at just $0.0002 in Stage 15 of its presale, and only one stage remains before launch at $0.0006. Let that sink in. If you invest $7,000 today, you’ll bag 35 million tokens. Add the LAUNCH100 code at checkout and boom—that doubles to 70 million. When BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, that stash becomes $42,000. But here’s the kicker: if BTFD smashes its moon target of $0.006, you’re looking at $420,000. All from one early move. And this isn’t guesswork. Over 72 billion tokens have already been scooped up, with more than $6.42 million raised and 11,600+ Bulls on board. The BTFD game is not some whitepaper fantasy either—it’s fully playable, letting users earn tokens while running with the Bulls Squad. Hey Bulls, your bonus is here! BTFD just dropped the most generous offer in presale season. Enter LAUNCH100 and get 100% bonus tokens. But you’ve got to act fast—this ends on March 30. Go to the BTFD Presale , connect your wallet, enter the code in ALL CAPS, and double your bag before launch day. Still want more? The BTFD referral program gives you 10% of all sales made with your link, and if you rank in the top 20, you earn even more. Your mates get 10% extra BTFD too. That’s passive income and squad building all in one go. Why is BTFD leading this list the best cryptos to buy now? Because it blends meme culture with real utility, rewards early adopters, and is the only coin offering 2x tokens, staking, and gaming—all before launch. 2. Comedian (BAN) – The Crowd-Pleaser with Comic Timing BAN isn’t just a crypto, it’s a statement. Created as a parody of cancel culture and meme-driven outrage, BAN has built a die-hard community of supporters who treat every token like a backstage pass. What started as a joke now powers content rewards, NFT drops, and comedic battles across X. Why is this funny coin in the lineup of the best cryptos to buy? Because its viral energy turns memes into momentum, and its community can’t stop winning. 3. FLOKI Inu (FLOKI) – Vikings, Whales, and the GameFi Dream From meme to movement, FLOKI has evolved into a GameFi beast. With Valhalla—its metaverse game—hitting mainnet, FLOKI is finally delivering on years of anticipation. Whale accumulation has exploded recently, with $4.7 million worth of tokens snapped up in just 24 hours. Why did FLOKI make the cut? Because it’s not just about memes anymore—it’s about metaverse muscle and massive money flows. 4. SPX6900 (SPX) – Meme Market’s Satirical Genius What happens when you mix satire, stock market mockery, and ridiculous branding? You get SPX6900. Riding on the joke of the S&P 500 “mooning” to 6900, this coin’s got meme meta appeal and wild trading energy. Community-driven and completely irreverent, SPX thrives on chaos and meme magic. Why is SPX among the best cryptos to buy? Because sometimes the biggest gains come from the most unhinged places—and SPX is living proof. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Buy Before the Market Goes Full Bull Think you’re too late for life-changing gains? Think again. The next bull cycle is already bubbling up under our feet, and early believers are already stacking bags in presales like BTFD, where the entry price is still $0.0002 and the upside could be explosive.

42534726,https://finbold.com/?p=242206,1743175227,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Crypto market erases $100 billion in 24 hours,https://finbold.com/crypto-market-erases-100-billion-in-24-hours/,"Though the trading days since March 11, and particularly since March 23, brought renewed hope for cryptocurrency investors with, for example, Bitcoin ( BTC ) rallying nearly 10% within two weeks, the 24 hours between Thursday and Friday moved the needle back into fear. The 24 hours leading up to press time on March 28 generated a 3.70% market-wide crash that ensured the total market capitalization of digital assets plummeted by just over $100 billion to $2.71 trillion. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization 24-hour chart. Source: TradingView The valuation and price drop has been accompanied by a new shift in the ‘Fear & Greed Index,’ per the data retrieved by Finbold from CoinMarketCap . Specifically, investor sentiment hit 12-month lows earlier in March, only to enter a sharp recovery in more recent sessions. The latest plunge abruptly ended the positive shift in attitudes, ensuring that the index is, at its press time value of 33, close to the previous 2025 lows and significantly under anything seen between March 2024 and February of the current year. Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index: Source: CoinMarketCap Why Crypto is crashing today Furthermore, the attitudes displayed by the ‘Fear & Green’ appear to be the main driver behind the latest plunge. For all the positivity, the cryptocurrency market has been extraordinarily susceptible to external bearish factors in the last 12 months and indifferent to internal bullish developments. The latest $100 billion, 24-hour plunge likewise appears to have started due to the contagion from the stock market , where the Magnificent 7 became something of an S&P 500 loss leader earlier this week, only to be followed by the automotive industry on Thursday. The root cause behind the selloff is a combination of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the growing fears that Silicon Valley may be facing a Dot-com-like crash due to the alleged data center bubble. Looking beyond just the latest woes, much of the 2025 market troubles can be linked to President Trump’s approach to international relations – political, as well as economic – growing competition from China, and the fact inflation is once again on the rise. The fact that the stock and cryptocurrency markets enjoyed an exceptionally strong 2024 is, likewise, not helpful as it had both created the conditions for a bearish correction, and increased fears that certain sectors might have inflated into dangerous bubbles. Long-term positivity persists despite short-term bloodbath Despite the grim short-term picture, analysts, insiders, moghuls, and the community have remained relatively bullish by press time. For example, Strategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR ) Michael Saylor opined that Bitcoin’s market capitalization could eventually hit $500 trillion when speaking at the 2025 Blockchain Summit. The latest prediction is a significant upgrade from the 2021 $100 trillion prediction and, arguably, a significant stretch. On the topic of another popular cryptocurrency, XRP , Ali Martinez, an established cryptocurrency analyst on X , maintained on March 28 that the token could flip back to a bullish outlook, provided it climbs above $3, as Finbold reported earlier on the day. The cryptocurrency community likewise remains optimistic with the XRP predictions, though Friday could sour the situation as multiple analyses have identified March 28 as an important day for the token.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto market sees a major coin facing price challenges, while a new platform attracts investors with a huge token giveaway. Table of Contents XYZVerse price prediction: Can investors expect a 30x surge? Solana Conclusion The cryptocurrency market presents contrasting developments as a well-known coin struggles to overcome price hurdles, while a new platform draws early backers with a massive token giveaway. Investors are closely monitoring these shifts, curious about the potential impact on their portfolios. What challenges await the established player, and what opportunities does the newcomer offer? You might also like: Chainlink and AVAX show bullish signs, XYZVerse takes the spotlight with $10m buying surge XYZVerse price prediction: Can investors expect a 30x surge? XYZVerse has entered the memecoin space during a period of increased investor enthusiasm for community-driven cryptocurrencies. Recent successes of memecoins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk highlight how compelling branding, viral marketing, and an engaged community can significantly boost token prices. The broader market sentiment is also poised to favor XYZVerse, especially as the altcoin season approaches, sparking renewed interest in low-cap meme tokens. Currently in presale, XYZVerse is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend, particularly if it secures high-profile exchange listings and sustains community excitement post-launch. Key Factors Boosting XYZVerse’s Potential: Strong Branding & Influencer Partnerships: Sports affiliations and influencer marketing broaden the project’s visibility. Deflationary Tokenomics: A significant 17.13% token burn decreases circulating supply, creating upward price pressure. Liquidity Provision: Allocating 15% of tokens to liquidity ensures price stability upon launch. Community Engagement: A dedicated 10% for community incentives encourages active participation and long-term holding. Detailed XYZ Price Forecast: Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Immediate Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (based on project projections) Potential Peak Post-Launch (First 1-2 Weeks): $0.15 – $0.25 (with strong demand and effective FOMO-driven listings) Long-Term Target (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (assuming successful strategic partnerships and major exchange listings) Assessing the Reality of a $0.10 XYZVerse Token: Achieving a 30x increase to hit $0.10 post-presale is plausible if the following factors align: Major Exchange Listings: Inclusion on leading exchanges such as KuCoin, OKX, or Binance could trigger significant initial price spikes. Robust Community Momentum: Effective execution of influencer and social media strategies could maintain high community engagement. Positive Market Trends: Continued bullish sentiment around Bitcoin and altcoins would amplify speculative interest in XYZVerse. Evaluating the Possibility of a 3000% Price Increase: While XYZVerse possesses strong foundational elements for a successful launch, long-term price sustainability relies heavily on team execution. If the XYZVerse team successfully hits its roadmap milestones, especially through effective marketing, strategic partnerships, and strong community engagement, the $0.10 price target — representing a 3000% increase from its presale price — becomes a realistic goal. Solana Solana (SOL) has seen some movement recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 2%. However, over the past month, the price dipped by 2.91%. Looking at the last six months, it has fallen by 12.44%. This shows a mix of short-term gains and longer-term declines. The current price ranges between $124.50 and $138.79. The nearest resistance level is at $144.65, while the nearest support is at $116.07. If the price rises, it may face resistance around $144.65, which is about 4% above the current high. If it falls, it could find support around $116.07, roughly 7% below the current low. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41.11, suggesting the coin is not overbought or oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.8177, indicating a slight bearish trend. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $138.84 and $139.46, respectively. This could point to potential price consolidation. These factors suggest that SOL may continue to trade within its current range unless significant market changes occur. Conclusion Despite potential in SOL and others, XYZVerse emerges as a leading memecoin, uniting sports fans, aiming for 20,000% growth with its unique, community-driven ecosystem.

Aave ( AAVE ) a top decentralized finance protocol, has integrated the Smart Value Recapture on the Ethereum ( ETH ) mainnet. This follows an on-chain vote by the community. Chainlink ( LINK ) introduced the MEV recapture solution in December 2024. With this integration , Aave and Chainlink aim to recover oracle extractable value that has previously leaked to blockchains. SVR is thus introducing a new standard for Aave and others in the DeFi ecosystem, a way to add to network revenue. It’s also a big move for a platform to create a sustainable economic path as they tap into oracles . The deployment is a joint effort between Chainlink and Aave-focused developer groups BGD Labs and Aave Chan Initiative, with additional input from Flashbots, a research and development platform working on solutions to the negative effects of extractable value on Ethereum.

But once again, the Aave-Chainlink partnership delivers, innovating responsibly on the edge with SVR and its OEV recapturing model,” Ernesto Boado, the co-founder of BGD Labs, said in a statement. As a start, Aave will use SVR to reclaim liquidation MEV from Threshold Bitcoin (tBTC)—the Bitcoin-backed token that allows holders to mint and use BTC on Ethereum to access DeFi opportunities. Initial support will also include LBTC, AAVE, and LINK, with more markets to follow. Revenue from the recaptured value will be split 65% for Aave and 35% for Chainlink communities during the first six months. Chainlink plans to convert its portion of SVR fees into LINK, to be distributed to network service providers.

As part of his analysis, he highlighted a head-and-shoulders pattern that could spark the breakdown below $2. Peter Brandt Identifies XRP Head And Shoulders Pattern In an X post, Brandt revealed that XRP is forming a textbook head-and-shoulders pattern, which has caused the altcoin to range-bound. He added that the head-and-shoulders pattern projects a price decline to as low as $1.07. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that XRP could witness a freefall to this target if it loses the $1.9 support. Related Reading: Analyst Unveils Extended XRP Price Target To $44, Reveals When To Take Profits Crypto analyst CasiTrades had also recently raised the possibility of XRP dropping to as low as $1.54. She revealed that a break below the $2.25 support and lower support at $1.90 could lead to this breakdown to $1.54. However, the analyst suggested that the probability of this happening was really low, as the $2.25 support is holding really strongly. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also discussed the head-and-shoulders pattern that had formed for the XRP price. In an X post, he stated that if XRP can break above $3, it would invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, a development that could flip the altcoin’s outlook to bullish. In his analysis, Brandt had also hinted that a rally above $3 could invalidate the bearish pattern. Martinez’s accompanying chart showed that XRP could drop to as low as $1.25 if this head-and-shoulders pattern plays out. In another post, he again raised the possibility of XRP suffering this price breakdown, while stating that the $2 price level remains the critical support level for the crypto. Bullish Outlook For The Altcoin In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price, predicting it could reach as high as $23.20. The analyst claimed that the third wave targets a rally of between $5.85 and $8.076. Meanwhile, the fifth wave is expected to finish the move between $18.22 and $23.20. Related Reading: This Crypto Analyst Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash Below $2, Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast This prediction came as part of Dark Defender’s analysis of the 3-month candle. He affirmed that XRP boasts a clear bullish momentum on this higher timeframe. He added that there are ups and downs in smaller time frames, but the higher frames supersedes the smaller ones. In another post, the analyst assured XRP’s consolidation will be over soon. He revealed that the altcoin has formed a great bullish rectangle pattern and that the next leg up will send it to new all-time highs (ATHs). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.25, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Still, a combination of strong technicals and falling exchange balances signal that the Pepe price may enter beast mode soon. Pepe Coin Price May Surge as Exchange Balances Fall There are signs that investors are still accumulating Pepe coin, signaling a potential rebound in the coming weeks. Data by CoinCarp shows that, despite its recent crash, the number of Pepe holders has jumped to 417,000, up from 406,000 on the same day a month earlier. In most cases, holders drop as a coin’s price retreats. Pepe Holders Other data shows that Pepe balances on exchanges has dropped in the past few weeks. There are now 240.22 trillion tokens on exchanges, down from 241.86 trillion a week earlier. The total supply on exchanges has also dropped to 57%. Falling exchange reserves is a sign that crypto investors are holding their coins in their more secure self-custody accounts. That’s because investors move their coins from their wallets to exchanges when selling them. Pepe Balances on exchanges Technicals Point to More Pepe Coin Price Surge Pepe price may also enter beast mode because of its string technicals. The first main bullish catalyst is that there are signs that it has formed a giant double-botton pattern at $0.000005895. This pattern has two key parts: two down swings and a neckline, which in this case, is at the all-time high of $0.00002827. Further, the Pepe coin price has formed a falling wedge chart pattern . This pattern happens when an asset consolidates inside a descending and converging channel. A bullish breakout typically happens when the two lines near their confluence. Interestingly for Pepe, the confluence has happened at the lower side of the double-bottom pattern. Technical indicators point to more Pepe coin price upside. The BBTrend indicator has continued rising and is about to flip the zero line. This is a unique indicator created by subtracting the distance of the lower and upper lines of the Bollinger Bands. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Percentage Price Oscillator have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the coin may surge soon, potentially to the all-time high of $0.00002827, up by 265% from the current level. A crash below the double-bottom point at $0.00000589 will invalidate the bullish Pepe price forecast . It will do that by cancelling the double bottom pattern and signaling more downside to $0.0000500.

Perhaps the most significant of these was the launch of Official TRUMP ( Trump ), the president’s very own meme coin . Released on January 17, just days before the inauguration, TRUMP quickly skyrocketed , reaching an all-time high (ATH) price of $44.28 per token on January 21, as well as a market capitalization of roughly $14.7 billion. The frenzy was short-lived. By the end of January, Official TRUMP was changing hands at a price of $24.05, and has been on a steady downward trajectory ever since. At press time on March 28, the president’s meme coin was trading at a price of $10.18. TRUMP price all-time chart. Source: Finbold Back in early February, Finbold reported on the huge losses accrued by one cryptocurrency whale who decided to bet on Official TRUMP. His initial $12 million investment shot up to $23.8 million in value, leaving him with a tidy $11.8 million profit. Unfortunately for him, he doubled down, spent $33.9 million to open a new position, and then closed it once it had dropped to $12.85 million in value. This $21 million loss brought his total losses to $10 million. That same trader opened a new position on March 3, having bought 777,684 TRUMP, according to Lookonchain . This whale made $11.82M on his first $TRUMP trade, lost $24.35M on the second, and took another $201K loss on the third! Now, he's back—spending $11.28M to buy 777,684 $TRUMP at $14.50. Will he turn a profit this time? https://t.co/udjuLMtcUH pic.twitter.com/s8TGHdDH95 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 3, 2025 On March 28, he liquidated this position, and once again accrued millions of dollars worth of losses. Whale’s Official TRUMP losses now stand at approximately $13.35 million The latest trade, which took place at a price of $14.50 per token, was valued at roughly $11.27 million at the time of acquisition. Data retrieved by Finbold from Solscan indicates that most of the wallet’s Official TRUMP holdings were sold off through a series of transactions roughly 10 hours before the time of publication.

According to a March 28 Reuters report, Musk’s DOGE team contacted the SEC and was told it would be given access to the commission’s systems and data. The agency reportedly planned to establish a liaison team to work with the “efficiency” team, whose intentions were not immediately clear. “Our intent will be to partner with the DOGE representatives and cooperate with their request following normal processes for ethics requirements, IT security or system training, and establishing their need to know before granting access to restricted systems and data,” said an email to SEC staff, according to Reuters. After taking office as US President in January, Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing DOGE to implement cost-cutting measures, claiming efforts “to save taxpayers money.” However, many of Musk’s efforts — including attempting to fire staff at the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, and shutting down the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) — face lawsuits in federal court from parties alleging DOGE’s actions were illegal or unconstitutional.

Even after Hyperliquid delisted and froze the token, the whale still holds over 10% of its supply worth around $2 million. By Arkham Intelligence, the whale exploited liquidation dynamics to earn at least $6.26 million in profit. Exploit Mechanics: $6.26M Made in Minutes According to Arkham’s postmortem, in five minutes, the whale had established two long positions with $2.15M and $1.9M value, along with a short position of $4.1M. The value of JELLY shot up 400%, and the whale’s enormous short wasn’t unwound immediately. Instead, it was absorbed by the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP) for what it is designed to do with giant positions—essentially letting the profit run. Whale Continues to Hold $1.9M in Tokens Despite all the fallout, the whale’s five associated addresses continue to hold over $1.9M worth of JELLY on Solana, blockchain sleuth ZachXBT reports. “All JELLY was bought since March 22, 2025,” he tweeted on Telegram. The entity has been reported to keep on selling even after the intervention of Hyperliquid. Hype vs. Fundamentals: Lessons from JELLY Bitget Wallet COO Alvin Kan told Cointelegraph the crash highlights the weakness of meme-based tokens. “The JELLY saga is a harsh reminder that hype over fundamentals will not last,” Kan noted. “Projects built on speculation, as opposed to utility, will continue to be exposed.” Decentralization Questions and Reimbursements While Hyperliquid’s quick action curbed user collateral damage, critics argue that it toed the line between decentralization and control. The Hyper Foundation has promised to automatically refund most users except for the exploiter’s wallets.

Table of Contents Exploring Rollblock’s untapped potential Institutional interest for Solana increases Key milestones for XRP hit in March 2025 Don’t miss this early opportunity with Rollblock as Q2 approaches XRP and Solana, two of the most hyped altcoins in this bull run, are holding critical levels as sentiment remains cautious in the wake of persisting uncertainty in the market. The worst may be over at the end of Q1, with the stage being set for a major GameFi boom in 2025 akin to 2021. Leading that charge could be Rollblock , a rising star in the blockchain gaming space. By combining a play-to-earn structure with a rapidly expanding ecosystem, Rollblock is tapping into a renewed wave of investor enthusiasm. Learn more about how Rollblock is poised to lead in the next chapter of GameFi growth. You might also like: Rollblock up 510% as XRP and Solana rely on spot ETFs to stop rapid decline Exploring Rollblock’s untapped potential Rollblock features an expansive library of over 8,000 games, catering to a wide spectrum of players; from enthusiasts of classic casino games like blackjack, poker, and roulette, to those seeking one-of-a-kind blockchain-exclusive titles. The recent launch of sports betting services has expanded Rollblock’s utility even further, letting users bet on major sporting events such as the Super Bowl and monthly UFC fights. The platform’s tokenomics model is engineered from the ground up for sustainable growth and long-term value. 30% of Rollblock’s platform revenue is dedicated to RBLK token buybacks. Of this, 60% of the repurchased tokens are permanently burned to create scarcity, while the remaining 40% is distributed as staking rewards to incentivize holder engagement and maintain support over a long duration of time. Transparency and compliance are very important to Rollblock’s ecosystem. The platform has undergone a full audit with SolidProof and operates under an Anjouan Gaming license, which reinforces its legitimacy in the iGaming arena. With advanced encryption technology under its belt, Rollblock offers one of the most trusted gaming experiences in the blockchain space. Backed by a growing community of over 55,000 engaged users and $11.1 million already raised during its presale, Rollblock is well on track to redefine the blockchain gaming landscape. For forward-thinking investors and gamers alike, this presents an ideal opportunity to get involved early in a platform built for exponential growth. Institutional interest for Solana increases Solana is once again making headlines as major institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock deepen their involvement in the Solana ecosystem. Fidelity’s official Solana ETF filing and BlackRock’s launch of a $1.7 billion tokenized treasury fund on the network reflect growing confidence in Solana’s infrastructure, yet despite these critical milestones, Solana has barely reacted in price, suggesting the bullish news may already be priced in during a limbo period in the market. While Solana battles post-memecoin crash fatigue from retailers and degens, institutional adoption continues to rise. Solana recently led altcoin ETP inflows, and investors remain hopeful that a spot Solana ETF could be approved by the SEC this year. Looking ahead, Solana’s future appears intertwined with real-world utility. With the Firedancer upgrade coming and over 140,000 Solana phones on preorder, the next wave of growth may emerge from practical applications rather than speculative memes, which helped catapult Solana’s domination in 2024 with applications like Pump.Fun. Key milestones for XRP hit in March 2025 XRP is in the spotlight as optimism increases surrounding an ETF approval. Following the SEC’s decision to drop its multi year long lawsuit against Ripple and refund part of the imposed fine, Polymarket bettors now place 86% odds on an XRP ETF approval in 2025. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the SEC’s legal battle against XRP is “over,” opening the door for significant institutional inflows for XRP Market analysts suggest this turning point, paired with the SEC’s request to lift the injunction against Ripple, may trigger a new wave of XRP demand from institutional investors. With XRP now eligible for direct sales to large institutions and ETF approval seen as a matter of “when, not if,” major institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock are expected to enter the XRP arena. Don’t miss this early opportunity with Rollblock as Q2 approaches With its tenth presale stage underway and a price tag of only $0.062, RBLK is quickly capturing attention as a leading force in blockchain gaming. Market experts believe a major breakout could be on the horizon, positioning Rollblock for substantial gains as it continues to expand within the iGaming world.

The crypto market is always full of surprises, and ADA could well stagger the market with a comeback from its recent crash. With rumors still circling about Cardano’s role in a future US strategic stockpile, analysts are predicting a surge to $5 and beyond. Here’s why Cardano could be ready to run… Cardano Price Prediction: Can Layer One Powerhouse Really Hit $5? Cardano ($ADA) has long been a favorite among retail investors, leading it to become a staple of the CoinMarketCap crypto top ten index. Cardano is currently priced at $0.76 , having gained an encouraging 7% in market cap this week alone. The top trader Jupiter remains optimistic about Cardano’s chances for a massive run this year. He tweeted his long-term prediction that‘$ADA is going to $6+ this cycle, lock in.’ Recent upgrades to Cardano’s Hydra scaling solution have improved the chain’s transaction speeds and network efficiency generally. The platform is also tipped to be included in the recently announced US strategic crypto stockpile, although the exact allocations have yet to be released. Experts predict that if the momentum continues, $ADA could break past resistance at $1 soon, with a long-term target of $5+ by year-end. With exceptionally strong fundamentals and steadily growing adoption, Cardano remains a solid choice for long-term investors looking for reliable gains. Rollblock ($RBLK): RBLK Token Supply Shrinking Every Day The world of GameFi is evolving fast, and Rollblock ($RBLK) is at the cutting edge of progress. Unlike inflationary gaming tokens that flood the market on a tragically regular basis, Rollblock’s supply is shrinking daily. It's no wonder that the platform is seeing explosive growth, with new gamer signups, total deposits, and wagered bids climbing month after month. Presale inflows have already hit $11.1 million, and things are just warming up. Rollblock offers over 7,000 classic games, including live dealer poker, blackjack, and a new sports prediction league that has gone down incredibly well with the gaming community. Every bid and payout is secured on the Ethereum blockchain, bringing trust and transparency to this growing $500 billion industry. Fiat deposits are now live via Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, making it easier than ever for the masses to get in on the action. Meanwhile, a recent Rollblock tweet teased an upcoming Burn Dashboard, offering live insights into burn rates and circulating supply. Rollblock’s Supply Is Only Getting More Scarce Rollblock’s tokenomics are built for long-term growth. Its deflationary revenue-sharing scheme takes 30% of platform revenue to buy back $RBLK on the open market. Of these buybacks, 60% are instantly burned to reduce the supply, while the remaining 40% fund staking rewards with APYs of up to 30%. With over 52% of Stage 10 tokens now sold at $0.062, prices will rise yet again soon as major exchange listings approach later this year. MARCH MAYHEM is adding even more excitement! Investors who refer a friend in March will both receive a 30% $RBLK bonus, plus a 20% purchase bonus. Check out this detailed review of Rollblock’s platform: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1TahMr56Qw Rollblock Offers The Most Upside Of All Cardano’s price prediction looks promising, but Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is the real game-changer in the markets right now.

Interest in AVAX is returning, and Grayscale is prepared to offer additional products based on the L1 token. Grayscale, one of the most active issuers of crypto-based products, has filed for a new ETF based on Avalanche (AVAX). Nasdaq submitted a 19b-4 form on behalf of Grayscale, outlining the fund’s conditions. The recent filing follows a wave of new applications for ETF. VanEck has also recently filed for a similar fund in the past two weeks. Grayscale already offers its Avalanche Trust for private placements and accredited investors. The new ETF would be available to retail buyers aiming to gain exposure to AVAX. The fund has just $1.7M in assets under management, while a full ETF may attract more significant buying. Grayscale offers multiple ETP products with exposure to a growing list of assets. However, some of those funds are limited to accredited investors and do not result in demand for the underlying assets. The ETF will be based solely on the value of AVAX and will not contain a cash component to balance the risk. The Trust for the Avalanche ETF is not an investment company under the definition of the Investment Company Act and has no intentions of actively managing the fund. The AVAX ETF will create and redeem baskets of shares, with the possibility of creating or redeeming them in kind for Avalanche tokens. Previous ETFs were mostly cash-settled, though new applications are trying to achieve in-kind settlement . Avalanche chain pivots to DeFi Following the news, AVAX traded in its usual range at $20.54. The asset continued to show weakness following the overall market drawdown. Avalanche is still considered a potential blue-chip project, though the network has lagged following the loss of gaming activity. AVAX is also showing signs of price weakness in the short term. The effect of the actual ETF may not be immediate, and it may take months until the product starts trading. $AVAX ETF announced, and this is what happened: Gentlemen it was nice knowing y’all pic.twitter.com/vh0mb7rWSY — contrarian snow ❄️ (@contrarian_snow) March 28, 2025 After filing the 19b-4 form, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has 90 days to approve or reject the filing. Even with procedures launched on many potential ETFs, the launch may still take time. Even now, launching a successful ETF beyond BTC and ETH takes months from filing to completion. The Avalanche project aims to recover its influence as Web3 gaming and GameFi are returning. The chain also works as an all-purpose Layer1 for decentralized apps. Avalanche offers one of the most viable infrastructures for Web3 projects. Previously, the chain carried NFT games like Crabada. The network offered its C-Chain, an all-purpose EVM-compatible network. Additionally, crypto projects could launch subnets with their own tokens. After Web3 games slowed down, Avalanche pivoted to DeFi. The chain still carries $1.16B in value locked, as well as $1.93B from stablecoin inflows. Avalanche is relatively liquid, receiving $74.19M from Ethereum. Avalanche aimed to boost adoption through its top ecosystem app, the Core Wallet. The Core Wallet now covers gas fees for all Avalanche C-Chain users to widen adoption. The zero-fee feature was added after the wallet’s latest update in March. The chain carries its own versions of Aave and other decentralized apps, including the GMX perpetual futures DEX. The chain carries close to 170K daily active users, with the most traffic coming from its DEX, Odos, as well as Aave and Uniswap versions. Games and NFT hubs have slowed down their activity significantly since the boom in 2021. The chain still generates around $640K in fees from its main apps.

Paintswap started as a DEX back in 2021 but quickly pivoted to become the NFT powerhouse we know today.

AI Paintswap Game Engine Paintswap is leading the ""vibe coding revolution"" with their AI Game Engine. This innovative tool lets you create entire games using just natural language! The system uses multiple AI agents working together so you can: Build smart contracts, music, and interactive UIs by just describing what you want Fork existing games from the library and add your own twist Stake BRUSH to earn revenue from games you believe in (if you get in early enough) Gone are the days when you needed coding skills to build games - Paintswap is democratizing game creation for everyone.

Since moving to Sonic, their $BRUSH token has become deflationary with 20% of all-time burns happening in just three months. The team consistently delivers quality across multiple verticals - something rare in Web3. And with PaintUSD coming in Q1/Q2 2025, they're expanding into DeFi proper. What's Next?

42535593,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=28631,1743176623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png,XRP Faces Strong Resistance While XYZVerse Gains Early Investor Attention With 10 Billion $XYZ Airdrop,https://btc-pulse.com/xrp-faces-strong-resistance-while-xyzverse-gains-early-investor-attention-with-10-billion-xyz-airdrop/,"One major cryptocurrency is struggling to move higher, facing strong obstacles in the market. At the same time, a new project is catching the eye of early investors by offering a massive giveaway of 10 billion of its own tokens. This surprising development is stirring curiosity. What could this mean for those following the digital currency scene? Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $10 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Ripple (XRP) XRP has seen significant fluctuations recently. Over the past week, the price decreased by 6.92%, settling within the current range of $2.25 to $2.61. In contrast, the past month showed a modest gain of 3.85%. Over six months, the coin experienced a substantial increase of 302.72%, highlighting a strong long-term uptrend. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index is at 42.22, suggesting XRP is approaching oversold territory. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.37, slightly below the 100-day average of $2.43, indicating a short-term bearish trend. Additionally, the MACD level of -0.0158 points to potential downward momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $2.79. Breaking above this could propel XRP toward the second resistance at $3.16, an increase of about 21%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2.05. If the price falls below this, it may test the second support at $1.68, representing a potential decrease of approximately 25%. These levels are crucial for traders watching XRP’s next move. Conclusion While XRP remains strong, XYZVerse shines as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting massive growth during the 2025 bull run.

With so many projects emerging, how do you know which one is worth your attention? Let’s dive into a standout new coin that’s got everyone talking: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Alongside the latest buzz about other major crypto players, Arctic Pablo is causing waves with its unique presale structure, explosive growth potential, and rewarding mechanisms. This article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Binance, and Bonk, and explore why APC is a must-watch during this exciting presale phase. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Game-Changer for Crypto Investors Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making a name for itself in the crypto world with its one-of-a-kind presale structure and significant investment potential. With its staking rewards offering an impressive 66% APY during the presale, investors are already seeing the benefit of getting in early. But it doesn’t stop there. APC also offers referral incentives, giving holders a chance to earn even more by sharing the word about this exciting project. The Arctic Pablo presale is unique in its token burn mechanism, a strategy designed to increase the value of each token. Unsold tokens are burned every week, reducing the total supply and increasing scarcity, which could help boost token value in the long term. To further fuel excitement, token burns are recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and traceability. With over $2 million already raised, APC is gaining momentum as it enters the 16th phase of its presale journey in Crystal Cove. Investors who have joined in so far are poised to see massive returns. The current price of $0.000083 per APC token presents an incredible opportunity for early-stage investors, as the anticipated listing price is $0.008, representing a staggering ROI potential of over 9552.41%. As Arctic Pablo continues its journey through different locations, the price is set to rise. Now is the time to secure your place before the cost climbs higher. With its deflationary token burn strategy and the strong momentum behind it, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as one of the top cryptos to join for short-term gains. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Limited Time to Grab Huge Returns The Arctic Pablo Coin presale is unlike any other you’ve seen before. As the project has already passed through 14 locations, it’s now entering the 16th phase at Crystal Cove. The opportunity to buy in at such a low price of $0.000083 is fleeting, with each new phase driving the price higher. Early investors have already raised over $2 million for the project, and the hype around APC is only growing. This is the time to get in before the price moves up as Arctic Pablo “travels” through its meme coin presale journey. At the current phase, the ROI from Crystal Cove to the listing price is an eye-watering 9552.41%, making it a prime investment for anyone looking for fast, short-term returns. The presale mechanism ensures that as the price rises, the opportunity for profit diminishes, making this an exciting window for savvy investors. If you’re looking for a crypto with massive potential, look no further than Arctic Pablo Coin, where scarcity, demand, and high ROI come together to create an irresistible offer. Binance: Breaking News and New Opportunities Binance continues to solidify its position as one of the leading platforms in the crypto industry. Recent updates highlight its commitment to enhancing user experience, including introducing new features for token staking and yield farming. As the industry continues to evolve, Binance remains a key player in supporting the growth of promising new projects, with Arctic Pablo Coin potentially making its mark on this platform. As more projects like APC gain attention, Binance’s infrastructure could serve as the perfect launchpad for expanding its user base and ensuring widespread adoption. Bonk: The Meme Coin That Keeps Growing Bonk, another meme coin that’s been making waves in the crypto community, has seen significant growth over the past few months. Its unique community-driven approach and the support it has garnered from various influencers in the space have allowed it to maintain relevance despite market fluctuations. As meme coins continue to capture attention, Bonk’s continued rise could signal new opportunities for investors looking for fun, high-risk plays in the crypto market. While Bonk and Arctic Pablo may appeal to different investor strategies, both are part of a larger trend toward rewarding communities and offering compelling investment opportunities.

Over the past six years, Buffett has funneled $77.8 billion into repurchasing shares of his own company, Berkshire Hathaway. That massive investment has paid off big, with Berkshire’s stock jumping nearly 16% year-to-date while the S&P 500 slides about 3%. Buffett paused the buybacks late last year, hinting he might see fewer bargains ahead, with Berkshire’s diverse holdings spanning insurance, railroads, and energy adding fuel to the rally. In recent months, Buffett has also shifted Berkshire’s capital away from US stocks, selling off $5.5 billion in Bank of America shares in late 2024. He’s now sitting on a massive $334 billion cash pile and recently invested in five Japanese trading companies. His new stakes include Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. Although Buffett, now 94, says he has no plans to retire from his role as CEO, he has outlined a succession plan. He’s designated his three children to oversee a charitable trust that will distribute 99.5% of his $150 billion fortune after his death, and says Greg Abel is set to take over as CEO when the time is right.

Experts Say This New Crypto May Flip All 3,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/cardano-price-prediction-could-ada-flip-eth-and-sol-experts-say-this-new-crypto-may-flip-all-3,"The value of Cardano (ADA) maintains a price of $0.73 during Thursday with investors anticipating more than 4% growth during the week. The blockchain analytics indicate positive price movement since ADA stablecoin usage increases and traders expect increased values for ADA tokens. Remittix stands out as a separate coin which gained popularity after its successful funding exceeded $14.1 million from selling 523 million tokens priced at $0.0734 each. Various analysts predict that Remittix will surpass ADA while becoming more invaluable than Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Cardano’s Rally and Key Indicators Source: ADA/USDT Daily Chart. The price of Cardano has stabilized at $0.74 following an increase in trader predictions about market gains. ADA traders holding long positions currently outnumber traders betting on a decline based on the Coinglass record of a 1.15 long-to-short ratio. The rising trader ratio sends positive signals to market analysts. The stablecoin market cap for ADA reached $30.77 million during Monday according to information provided by DeFiLlama. Strong stablecoin presence leads to higher levels of DeFi liquidity which benefits Cardano through better network activity and ecosystem expansion. Prediction models expect ADA to increase 13% if it secures weekly resistance near $0.77 and manages to stay above that level until it reaches $0.83 . ADA facing a higher resistance push may indicate more durable bullish pressure that would follow throughout the session. The initiative presents hazards together with its potential opportunities. Can Cardano Flip Ethereum and Solana? Source: tradingview . Solid evidence suggests ADA may become a rival to ETH and SOL in a later phase. The technology behind Cardano performs thorough peer-reviewed evaluations to determine its next moves. Cardano's methodical enhancement process through new DeFi tools alongside stablecoin usage and sidechain solutions according to believers will boost its market capitalization. The authors emphasize that optimistic market periods reward development communities that show the most active code development. Cardano maintains a strong and dedicated team which continuously improves its code. A transformation of Ethereum or Solana positions within the upcoming months appears challenging to achieve. ETH holds the position of the second-biggest cryptocurrency behind BTC while SOL stands out for both speed and its comprehensive DeFi network features. Some critics doubt if the planned enhancements on Cardano's roadmap will enable the platform to surpass existing competitors like the established projects. This is the context driving the adoption of Remittix because experts say its limited-release cryptocurrency may defeat well-established digital assets in everyday applications. Remittix: The Coin Experts Believe Could Surpass All Three Remittix strives to dominate the crypto industry by providing quick and straightforward crypto-to-fiat conversion services as it surpasses both Cardano and ETH and SOL. The platform draws investment from original contributors who paid in excess of $14.1 million for their purchase of 523 million+ tokens at $0.0734 each. People show enthusiasm for Remittix because its direct method connects digital assets with ordinary currency which enables users to make their digital holdings spendable as money. The Remittix pitch stands apart from numerous complicated feature tokens and limited audience projects. For Remittix the adoption of digital currencies requires eliminating all obstacles which make common transactions inconvenient. The Remittix platform operates like XRP but targets regular consumers for its daily usage needs. The platform will gain its early mass user base because it handles ordinary daily transactions provided it proves its reliability. User growth will speed up exponentially when Remittix establishes collaboration deals with both payment platforms and e-commerce websites. The experts monitoring market trends point out that basic solutions manage to catch the attention of both novice crypto users and seasoned traders. Outlook for ADA and Remittix Remittix offers the potential to bypass Ethereum and Solana in the market by providing solutions focused on practical user requirements according to some expert opinions. The main benefit of Remittix comes from its ability to bypass the overpopulated competition between DeFi infrastructure and layer-1 blockchains. The solution of a fundamental daily issue differentiates it from the competition. The success of Cardano during its upcoming period depends on maintaining positive trends in market value. The ADA price rising through $0.77 would strengthen bullish forecasts about replacing other dominating altcoin positions. The adoption of Remittix infrastructure could diminish industry discussions because it provides a simpler platform for mass usage.

The company will invest part of its excess cash and earnings into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, currently the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF. The company has already invested $2 million into this Bitcoin ( BTC ) initiative and plans to increase its holdings as cash reserves grow.​ The company has “plans to continue this practice as the Company’s cash reserves continue to grow.” You might also like: PENGU dives as Pudgy Penguins sales, floor price crashes Traditional finance adding Bitcoin to their reserves Firms like MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific have also made significant Bitcoin investments, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. The decision to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, like IBIT, offers companies exposure to Bitcoin’s potential benefits without the complexities of direct ownership, such as custody and security concerns. KULR Technology Group is a good example of this trend as it recently increased its Bitcoin holdings to 668.3 BTC after purchasing an additional $5 million worth at an average price of $88,824 per BTC. KULR, which committed in December 2024 to allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash to Bitcoin, has reported a 181.1% BTC yield year to date.

Rose Premium Signals recently reinforced this outlook, identifying $289 as Solana’s next target. Yet, despite the growing optimism around SOL, many investors and traders are gravitating toward Rollblock. While Solana and other major altcoins have faced periods of struggle, Rollblock has demonstrated impressive resilience, boosting confidence in its long-term potential. The GameFi token has already surged over 520%, delivering consistent returns even as the broader market remains volatile. With momentum continuing to build, a growing number of investors believe RBLK could realistically hit the $1 mark by the end of 2025. Solana Price Prediction: Traders Are Once Again Bullish On Solana! According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez , Solana futures traders are showing a clear bullish tilt, with 78.82% of open positions on Binance currently long. This has pushed the Long/Short Ratio to 3.72, indicating that traders are more than three times as likely to bet on an upward move rather than a decline. In contrast, Bitcoin has seen its own Long/Short Ratio drop from 2.05 to 1.71, reflecting more tempered sentiment. This growing optimism comes at a time when Solana’s Open Interest has bottomed out after months of decline. Data from Coinglass reveals that Futures OI has dropped by 58% since peaking at nearly $6 billion in January, now sitting at $2.54 billion. This mirrors Solana’s 52% price correction from $290 down to around $142. Despite the downturn in price and futures interest, signs of stabilization are emerging. According to DefiLlama , network fees and revenue have fallen 96.5% from January highs, but user activity remains relatively robust. In fact, Solana’s DEX volume recently hit $1.55 billion in a single day, nearly matching Ethereum’s $1.66 billion—even though Solana’s total value locked is only one-sixth the size. Now ranked second in DeFi TVL with $6.8 billion, Solana continues to demonstrate strong on-chain activity despite muted price momentum. With futures traders positioning for a rebound and network usage holding up, Solana may be gearing up for a bounce – provided it can maintain support at key technical levels. Rollblock Attracts 65,000+ Early Investors With Blockchain Revolution The online gaming industry generates over $450 billion annually, but fraud remains a major issue, with iGaming scams rising 64% in the past two years. Rollblock is addressing this by creating a secure gaming platform on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers over 7,000 AI-powered games, including live dealers and sports betting, with every outcome recorded on-chain to prevent fraud and manipulation. Partnering with 10 top iGaming providers, Rollblock delivers a trusted and transparent gaming experience. This focus on security and efficiency has driven rapid growth. Rollblock added over 10,000 new players in February alone and raised $2 million in presale funding, pushing total presale earnings to over $11.1 million across ten rounds. Growing player interest reflects confidence in Rollblock’s ability to create a fair and transparent gaming environment. A series of Web3 personalities also noted the market potential, with Youtuber Freddie Finance at the forefront of Rollblock’s praise. At the core of Rollblock’s ecosystem is RBLK, the platform’s native token, currently priced at $0.062 after surging over 620% during the presale. RBLK drives governance, VIP rewards, and staking within the platform. With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, it follows a deflationary model designed to reduce supply and increase demand. Rollblock allocates up to 30% of its weekly revenue to token buybacks, burning 60% of repurchased tokens and distributing 40% as staking rewards. This approach strengthens long-term value by reducing circulating supply and rewarding token holders, reinforcing RBLK’s strength as a valuable asset in the GameFi sector. Will RBLK Reach $1 This Cycle? Investors believe that if Rollblock can sustain its current momentum and continue attracting more users and players, RBLK could realistically reach $1 by the end of 2025. Unlike many other presale altcoins, RBLK stands out with strong fundamentals and real utility - an increasingly important factor in today’s crypto economy. This solid foundation could be the decisive factor that drives RBLK’s value beyond a 100x increase, surging from its initial price of $0.01 to the highly anticipated $1 mark.

Short for “Shiny Object Syndrome And Nothing Accomplished,” SOSANA turns meme-fueled chaos into community-driven success. It’s more than just another token—it’s a movement. With a structured voting system that rewards smart degens and filters out the noise, SOSANA brings accountability, trust, and real rewards back to the Solana ecosystem. The project embraces crypto’s chaotic nature with a satirical twist, but its systems, rewards, and voting mechanism are built to last. Solana’s Rapid Growth Faces New Challenges Solana’s market has been a rollercoaster: Crashing 50% as FTX dumped 11.2 million SOL back into circulation. Soaring 25% overnight after Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. Facing network instability as degens chase the next “one hundred times” meme pump. With such rapid growth, Solana’s ecosystem has become overwhelmed with new token launches, making it harder for quality projects to stand out and for the network to function at full strength. Adding to the chaos, Solana is experiencing an unprecedented token oversupply. Platforms like Pump.fun have enabled tens of thousands of new token launches in just days, flooding the network with low-effort launches, rug pulls, and fleeting hype cycles. Legitimate projects struggle to break through, and degenerate gambling has become the norm. The Solution: SOSANA – Strengthening Solana Through Smarter Community Decisions SOSANA helps bring structure to Solana’s rapid expansion, making participation both smarter and more rewarding. By organizing how new tokens are discovered and supported, SOSANA ensures that the best projects thrive—strengthening confidence in Solana as a whole. Nominate & vote on upcoming tokens (no more blind gambling). The best projects rise based on votes—not just hype. Earn rewards for making the right calls. Stronger voting = stronger confidence = a more stable Solana. Degen Voter Bonus (1% reflections) is used to buy the winning token and distribute it to voters who backed the winner. As a result, quality triumphs over quantity. A system where real degens make smart decisions and get rewarded for it. SOSANA Community Hub The SOSANA Community Hub is where Solana enthusiasts connect, learn, and grow—featuring forum discussions, local meetups, giveaways, and crypto education covering everything from beginner basics to launching a project. Launch Details & Key Features SOSANA goes live March 17, 2025 . Voting rounds happen every two weeks. The person who nominates a winning token earns $500 in SOSANA . Referral program rewards smart degens who bring in others. Tokenomics designed for long-term engagement, not just pump & dump. Strengthening Solana Strengthens the Entire Market SOSANA isn’t just a name— but a mission. “Shiny Object Syndrome And Nothing Accomplished” perfectly describes the problem SOSANA is solving. Meme coins will always exist—but they don’t have to be random, risky, or rug-prone. By solving the junk token problem, SOSANA helps stabilize Solana, which in turn strengthens the entire crypto market. When Solana thrives, the industry thrives—and SOSANA is here to make sure that happens. This isn’t just about voting. It’s about coordinated action—when a winning token is crowned, the SOSANA community apes in together. SOSANA isn’t just a token. It’s a movement.

42536160,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/this-viral-007-altcoin-is-race-to-1-against-019-dogecoin-doge-who-wins,1743177487,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42536160.jpeg,This Viral $0.07 Altcoin Is Race To $1 Against $0.19 Dogecoin (DOGE) - Who Wins?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/this-viral-007-altcoin-is-race-to-1-against-019-dogecoin-doge-who-wins,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has stayed in the spotlight for years, thanks to its meme status and big-name endorsements. Different forecasts see DOGE reaching anywhere from $0.2053 in 2025 to as high as $1.44 by mid-2027. Meanwhile, a lesser-known contender called Remittix (RTX) , sitting at $0.0734 and having raised over $14.1 million with more than 522 million tokens sold, might climb to $1 more quickly if it becomes the go-to solution for cross-border payments. Below, we compare DOGE’s meme-driven growth potential to RTX’s real-world use case, deciding which coin might be first to $1. Dogecoin’s Path to $1 DOGE at $0.1941 According to CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin could land between $0.1819 and $0.2053 in 2025, reflecting modest growth from its current $0.1941 . A more bullish view from CoinJournal sets the 2025 target at $1.18 still a big leap for a meme coin often reliant on social media buzz. Cryptodaily sees DOGE possibly breaking $1 between mid-2026 and mid-2027, with a top price near $1.44. If hype remains high, DOGE can certainly jump fast, but it also faces huge swings when enthusiasm cools. Supporters note that DOGE remains among the top cryptos in market cap, boosted by a large community and some merchant acceptance. Critics point out that Dogecoin’s progress rests on external events, like tweets or new supporters. Without fundamental improvements, it might be tough for DOGE to stay pumped. Even if it hits $1, that might happen in 2025 according to CoinJournal, or perhaps not until the broader crypto market sees a massive bull run. What Is Remittix (RTX) at $0.0734? While DOGE rides waves of meme excitement, Remittix (RTX) aims at a gigantic global need: fast, affordable money transfers. Priced at $0.0734, RTX has raised over $14.1 million and sold more than 522 million tokens. Its main mission is to help everyday people, families, freelancers and small stores avoid wire fees or multi-day waits. Instead, they can switch cryptos like BTC, ETH or DOGE into local currency within about 24 hours, depositing it into normal bank accounts. Observers say if Remittix (RTX) aligns with payroll giants or e-commerce shops, user numbers may skyrocket. Because billions of dollars flow across borders daily, there’s a vast market for a direct, easy payment tool. Also, locked tokens and an audited contract give investors more confidence than typical presale tokens. That real utility, addressing a daily-life problem, might push RTX to $1 faster than coins dependent on hype alone. If mainstream adoption arrives quickly, it could surpass DOGE in the race to that milestone. Comparing DOGE vs. RTX on the Road to $1 Short-term forecasts for Dogecoin (DOGE) vary greatly, with some analysts believing that reaching $1 may require substantial hype or high-profile partnerships, potentially pushing the timeline into mid-2026 or mid-2027. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), still trading below $0.10, tackles a massive real-world problem in cross-border payments; its adoption could spike quickly if it secures partnerships with large retailers or payroll services. Market sentiment underscores that while many find DOGE entertaining, it is highly volatile. In contrast, Remittix (RTX) offers a more practical solution by bridging crypto with local banking for everyday use, appealing to those who prefer consistent adoption over short-lived hype. Conclusion: Remittix (RTX) Wins Although Dogecoin might eventually reach $1 some even say $1.44 by 2027 the coin’s success mostly hinges on hype and social influence. By comparison, Remittix (RTX), priced at $0.0734 with over $14.1 million raised and 522+ million tokens sold, solves real payment problems. If mainstream remittances move onto its blockchain-based system, RTX may cross $1 first. While DOGE can spike on memes, Remittix thrives on genuine, day-to-day demand. For investors seeking a more grounded bet yet still hungry for strong returns, Remittix (RTX) seems poised to win the race to $1. Ready to Give Remittix (RTX) a Go?

SHIB, currently trading at $0.000014. ADA continues to rank as the preferred long-term investment choice because its network expansion remains unaffected by market movements and its current price sits at $0.71. The little-known MUTM token from Mutuum Finance operates under the market rate of $0.025 during phase 4 of its presale period. The project successfully collected $5.7 million while obtaining more than 7300 holders within its early days of existence. The opportunity exists for you to obtain life-changing financial growth with a second opportunity. Mutuum Finance’s phase 4 price growth to $0.06 will increase by 25% from its current value of $0.05 while new investors entering during this period will see a 200% ROIs as the token launches at $0.06. Potential investors are rushing to acquire MUTM tokens until another price increase happens. Mutuum Finance is projected to increase to $3 which represents a multiple time ROI. Established vs. Emerging: ADA and SHIB’s Different Paths to Profitability Cardano (ADA) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) may both be under $1, but their appeal comes from vastly different strengths. ADA at $0.71 is a battle-tested blockchain focused on scalability and institutional adoption, attracting long-term investors who believe in its growing ecosystem. Meanwhile, SHIB $0.000014 thrives on community-driven hype and meme coin momentum, with frequent whale activity and an expanding DeFi presence keeping it relevant. While ADA builds its foundation for future dominance, SHIB capitalizes on volatility and short-term opportunities, offering traders a different but equally profitable approach. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors flock to Mutuum Finance due to its revolutionary decentralized finance model for crypto loans while decentralization funds its innovative financial services. The project maintains a rising momentum because it has received $5.7 million in investments and now attracts 7400+ investors. The Phase 4 token price at $0.025 presents investors with a limited opportunity as an upcoming 20% price boost charts the completion of early investment entry. Potential investors who join during the presale period could earn 140% ROI since the token has defined a listing price at $0.06. As the DeFi market grow, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge with its groundbreaking lending model and solid market positioning. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins P2C and P2P models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the P2C model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. Transforming Crypto Lending The Mutuum Finance stablecoin functions on Ethereum by keeping stable prices through USD fund reservations. Financial transactions rely on this stablecoin system because it uses a resistant structure which prevents algorithmic stability problems. The combination of next-generation financial lending approaches with robust infrastructure elements enables Mutuum Finance to create the path for decentralized finance development. Mutuum Finance represents an emerging leader in the crypto market because it grants investors the chance to earn appreciable benefits through its platform. More than 7,400 investors have turned to MUTM’s presale because it has already raised $5.7 million. The Phase 4 price of MUTM stands at $0.025 before reaching Phase 5 at $0.03 to provide 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Newly released analysis reveals predicted figures between $3 and $5 that analysts suggest could form the future market values during the upcoming bull cycle. All investors seeking promising DeFi solutions choose to buy MUTM as soon as possible for its potential growth.

The company’s short sales volume rose by 234% over 24 hours, reaching 30.85 million shares sold on March 27. The Short Sale Restriction is imposed after a stock drops over 10% from the previous day’s closing price. Google Finance data indicated that GameStop’s stock plummeted 22% over the trading day, wiping out its 12% gain from the Bitcoin announcement. GameStop Corp was trading at $22.09 at the time of publication, a 22.11% drop in the last 24 hours. NYSE issues Short Sale Restriction on GameStop GameStop stocks hit restrictions on NYSE after short volume rose to 234% over 24 hours 👀 pic.twitter.com/g8G2bsnvvK — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) March 28, 2025 The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has enforced a Short Sale Restriction (SSR) on GameStop after volumes surged to their highest levels in nine months. On-chain data showed that GameStop (GME) short sales volume, the total number of shares sold short within a specific time frame, spiked by 234% over 24 hours. The firm’s short sales volume also reached 30.85 million shares sold on March 27. President and CEO Kevin Malone noted on March 27 that GameStop had traded 50x more shares yesterday than the previous Thursday. Malone also argued that it was “not statistically possible without naked short selling.” The video game company reached numbers close to the levels it reached in January 2021 when its stocks went meteoric after a “short squeeze” of the stock. The short squeeze caused significant losses for hedge funds and other short sellers while some retail traders made returns. Source: TradingView . GameStop short volume reached 30.88 on March 27. Data showed that the highest point the firm’s shares reached that month was 33.26 million shares on January 19. GameStop still recorded the biggest day of short sales on June 3, 2024, when it reached 46.20 million. Stock trader Keith Gill, known for the short squeeze in 2021, disclosed on June 2 that he started trading GameStop stock again, this time with $180 million to play with. GameStop plans to purchase BTC as a reserve asset Shares of the gaming merchandise retailer also dropped more than 22% yesterday after it announced plans to finance its Bitcoin pivot amid its strategy to turn around its struggling retail business. The firm revealed on March 26 a $1.3 billion in 0% 2030 convertible notes offering to accumulate BTC. The firm acknowledged that the convertible senior notes would be used for general corporate purposes, will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the notes will not accrue; the company said the notes will mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Tastylive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff questioned GameStop’s plan to start purchasing Bitcoin. He mentioned that the video game company’s decision to buy Bitcoin felt “a little dot-comish.” “It feels a little like, oh, I’m going to throw a dot com at the end of my name, I’m going to buy some Bitcoin with our excess cash because we can;t find a company that is going to be accretive.” – Tom Sosnoff , Tastylive founder and CEO U.S. investment analyst at eToro Bret Kenwell highlighted that investors were not necessarily optimistic about the underlying business. He added that there were question marks with GameStop’s model, “if Bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” Kenwell also questioned why GameStop waited so long if they were going down that road. He suggested that “six months ago, nine months ago would have made a lot more sense.” Head of growth at decentralized bank WeFi Agne Linge believes that the overall outlook for crypto markets was also contributing to declines as GameStop’s move had “failed to meaningfully boost market confidence.” Stock analyst Han Akamatsu argued that the convertible notes offering announcement caused the stock’s decline. Akamatsu said GameStop’s stock was dropping for the same reason Strategy declined after issuing convertible notes. He also noted that MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes in 2021, which caused the stock to plummet after the announcement due to hedging shorts.

Saylor describes this potential rise as the 'modern digital gold rush.' He also suggests that the capital for Bitcoin's growth could come from various international sources, including Russian real estate, Chinese private equity, and assets from Africa and South America.

Senator Elizabeth Warren said he has close ties to big banks and the crypto sector. She believes this poses a risk of potential conflict of interest. He was accused of close ties to the crypto sector, including the FTX exchange, and potential conflicts of interest. Who is Paul Atkins? In December 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump selected him as his nominee for SEC chairman. He has experience at the Commission - from 2002 to 2008. Atkins is also the founder of the consulting firm Patomak Global Partners. The Atkins couple's fortune is estimated at $327 million, including stakes in several companies. At the same time, the candidate for the next SEC chairman has invested up to $6 million in the crypto sector; If elected, Atkins is committed to reducing a portion of his portfolio, as well as leaving senior positions in certain companies. In particular, he intends to sell his stake in Patomak Global Partners and leave the management of the firm. The committee's criticism of Atkins Among the most vocal opponents of the candidate to become the new head of the SEC was cryptoskeptic Elizabeth Warren. She veiledly accused Atkins of taking bribes and blamed him for his close ties to the bankrupt FTX exchange. The senator also criticized the Trump administration's handling of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under billionaire Elon Musk, saying the nation needs a ”strong head” of the SEC. ”Unfortunately, your experience at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) during Trump's first term and as an attorney for large financial counterparties suggests that you may view this appointment [to head the SEC] as a way to support your Wall Street friends. [...] Atkins has built his career around helping billionaires, including Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of one of the largest frauds in U.S. history,” Warren said. Note that FTX was indeed a client of Patomak Global Partners. The company signed a contract with the exchange to provide consulting services in early 2022. This, in particular, was pointed out by The Wall Street Journal . Warren also accused Atkins of misguided actions as commissioner during the 2008 financial crisis. Commenting on Atkins' intention to sell a stake in his consulting firm, Warren demanded that he disclose the amount of the deal and the recipient of the shares. According to her, if the details of the agreement are kept from the public, it could be seen as a bribe and an attempt to put pressure on the new head of the SEC. Atkins was also criticized by other committee members. In particular, Chairman Tim Scott insisted that the new SEC chief must present a clear plan to recoup the losses the Commission has suffered in a number of losing cases, including the DEBT Box. Sen. John Kennedy demanded Atkins bring charges against Sam Bankman-Fried's parents. The politician called them frauds, noting that the Commission never made any progress in the case. Directly Atkins himself noted that the main priority in case of approval of his candidacy will be the development of a regulatory framework for crypto-assets. At the same time, he expressed his intention to reform the SEC. He also rejected Warren's accusations that his alleged actions precipitated the financial crisis. Atkins shifted the blame for him to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In addition to Atkins, the committee considered three other nominees for various positions. The next step is a vote, after which they will be nominated to the Senate as a whole.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|DOGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 16:05:50

On March 19, Coinbase published a report disclosing that the US cryptocurrency exchange controlled more than 11% of staked Ether ( ETH ), more than any other Ethereum node operator . According to Karan Sirdesai, CEO of Web3 startup Mira Network, Coinbase’s growing dominance highlights “a systemic issue in Ethereum’s staking architecture.” “We’re creating a system where a handful of major players control an outsized portion of network security, undermining the core promise of decentralization,” Sirdesai told Cointelegraph. According to the report, Coinbase controlled 3.84 million ETH staked to 120,000 validators, representing 11.42% of staked Ether as of March 4. Liquid staking protocol Lido controls a larger share of staked Ether overall — approximately 9.4 million ETH, according to Lido’s website. However, Lido’s staked Ether is distributed across dozens of independent node operators, Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, said in a March 19 post on the X platform. To limit risks, Coinbase spreads staking operations across five countries and employs multiple cloud providers, Ethereum clients, and relays, according to its report. “Diversification at the network level and the overall health of the network is always a priority for us. That’s why we periodically check network distribution,"" the exchange said. Coinbase is the largest Ethereum node operator. Source: Coinbase Related: Ether ETFs poised to surge in 2025, analysts say Impending centralization risks Ethereum’s network concentration could worsen if US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are permitted to begin staking — a priority for asset managers such as BlackRock . Coinbase is the largest custodian for US crypto ETFs and holds ETH on behalf of eight of the nine US spot Ether funds, the exchange said in January. “This type of network consolidation brings with it increased risk of censorship and reduced network resilience,” Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain, a blockchain interoperability protocol, told Cointelegraph. For instance, high staking concentrations “represent potential points of regulatory pressure… [and] these large staking entities will likely prioritize regulatory adherence over network censorship resistance when faced with difficult choices,” Sirdesai said. Meanwhile, new US regulatory guidance allowing banks to act as validators for blockchain networks adds to centralization risks , several crypto executives said. “If too much stake consolidates under regulated entities like Coinbase and US banks, Ethereum will become more like traditional financial systems,” Louie said. Conversely, more institutional validators could actually improve staking concentrations. Cryptocurrency exchange Robinhood is especially well positioned to check Coinbase’s staking dominance, according to Sirdesai. Robinhood already has “the crypto infrastructure, user base, and technical capabilities to move into staking rapidly. They could realistically challenge Coinbase’s position faster than any traditional bank,” Sirdesai said.

Amp (AMP) is a decentralized collateral token facilitating fast and secure payment transactions on the Flexa network. The goal of Amp is to make cryptocurrencies better equipped to be used as everyday payments by solving the issues of possibly fraudulent transactions and the slow-speed transaction of ordinary cryptocurrencies.

Technical indicators give a relatively bearish verdict for the market conditions. The price charts also present a bearish scenario for the day. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the coming weeks will steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of 2025, potentially pushing AMP above $0.00907. However, conducting your research and seeking professional financial advice is recommended. Why is AMP down? AMP’s price has decreased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a considerable loss of 5.34% over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00396, which is in the average range as the bulls remained in the lead during the week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.006, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.00907. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $423.6 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.0342. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0393 by 2031.

Recently, one such analyst, @ai_9684xtpa, spotted a significant transaction that’s got the crypto community buzzing: a substantial deposit of MOVE tokens into Ceffu, Binance’s institutional custody platform, seemingly originating from a wallet linked to crypto market maker DWF Labs. Let’s dive deep into this intriguing development and explore what it might signify for the MOVE token and the broader crypto landscape. Unpacking the $6.6M MOVE Token Deposit by DWF Labs The specifics are compelling. Approximately 13.35 million MOVE tokens, valued at a hefty $6.6 million, were transferred to Ceffu. This wasn’t just a routine transaction; it was flagged as originating from an address strongly suspected to be associated with DWF Labs ‘ market-making activities. Why is this noteworthy? Because DWF Labs is a prominent player in the crypto market-making arena, known for its high-frequency trading and significant influence on token prices. Here’s a breakdown of the key details: Transaction: Deposit of 13.35 million MOVE tokens Value: $6.6 million Source Address: Suspected DWF Labs market-making address Destination: Ceffu (Binance Institutional Custody) Reported By: On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa Time: Approximately 11 hours ago (from the time of report) This movement of such a large quantity of MOVE tokens naturally raises questions. What is DWF Labs planning? Is this a precursor to market activity, or is it a strategic maneuver for longer-term holdings? Why Ceffu? Understanding Institutional Custody The choice of Ceffu as the deposit destination is crucial. Ceffu, Binance’s institutional custody platform, is designed for secure and compliant storage of digital assets for institutions. Unlike regular crypto exchanges, institutional custody solutions offer enhanced security measures, regulatory compliance, and often sophisticated reporting and management tools. Depositing tokens into Ceffu suggests a few possibilities: Enhanced Security: Institutional custody is paramount for large holders seeking to mitigate risks associated with exchange hacks or wallet vulnerabilities. Regulatory Compliance: For firms like DWF Labs , operating within regulatory frameworks is essential. Ceffu provides a compliant environment for holding significant crypto assets. Strategic Holding: Moving tokens to custody could indicate a longer-term holding strategy rather than immediate trading plans. The analyst @ai_9684xtpa also suggests that these MOVE tokens are “unlikely to be sold off for now.” This adds another layer to the narrative, implying that this deposit might not be a prelude to immediate market dumping or selling pressure. MOVE Token: What You Need to Know MOVE token is the native token of the Step App, a move-to-earn fitness platform. In the move-to-earn sector, users earn cryptocurrency by engaging in physical activities like walking, running, or jogging. These platforms often utilize NFTs and gamification to incentivize participation. Key aspects of the MOVE token and Step App ecosystem include: Move-to-Earn Concept: Rewards users for physical activity, tapping into the health and fitness trend combined with crypto incentives. Step App Platform: An ecosystem built around fitness and cryptocurrency, potentially attracting a user base interested in both. Market Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, MOVE token is subject to market volatility, influenced by broader market trends, project developments, and investor sentiment. The Role of a Crypto Market Maker Like DWF Labs Crypto market makers like DWF Labs play a vital, albeit often misunderstood, role in the digital asset ecosystem. They are firms that provide liquidity to exchanges and trading platforms, ensuring smooth trading and reducing price slippage. Here’s what crypto market makers typically do: Liquidity Provision: They place buy and sell orders on exchanges, creating a liquid market where traders can easily buy and sell assets. Price Stabilization: By continuously trading, they help to reduce price volatility and maintain market efficiency. Market Efficiency: They contribute to a more efficient market by narrowing the bid-ask spread, making trading more cost-effective. However, the activities of crypto market makers are also sometimes viewed with skepticism. Large token movements by these entities can trigger speculation about market manipulation or insider information. It’s crucial to analyze their actions within the context of their legitimate market-making functions. Institutional Custody and Market Confidence The increasing adoption of institutional custody solutions like Ceffu is a significant trend in the crypto space. It signals growing institutional interest and maturity in the market. When large firms choose to deposit assets into secure custody, it can boost market confidence and indicate a longer-term commitment to the asset class. Benefits of institutional custody for the crypto market: Increased Security: Reduces risks of theft and loss, crucial for attracting institutional capital. Enhanced Compliance: Facilitates regulatory adherence, essential for institutional investors. Market Maturation: Signals a move towards a more mature and regulated crypto market, appealing to traditional finance. Analyzing the Implications for MOVE Token Holders What does this $6.6 million MOVE token deposit mean for those holding MOVE tokens? While the analyst suggests no immediate sell-off, the actions of a major crypto market maker like DWF Labs always warrant attention. Potential implications could include: Long-Term Confidence: DWF Labs holding a significant amount in custody might indicate a positive long-term outlook on the MOVE token. Future Market Activity: While not an immediate sell-off, these tokens could be strategically deployed for market-making or other activities in the future. Price Stability: If DWF Labs uses these tokens for market-making, it could contribute to greater liquidity and price stability for MOVE. Strategic Moves in the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights This event serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the importance of staying informed. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on on-chain analytics platforms and analysts like @ai_9684xtpa for early signals of significant market movements. Understand Market Maker Activity: Familiarize yourself with the role and potential impact of crypto market makers like DWF Labs . Stay Updated on Institutional Trends: Track the adoption of institutional custody and other signs of institutional involvement in crypto. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on market news or analyst reports. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Tides The $6.6 million MOVE token deposit by a presumed DWF Labs address into Ceffu is more than just a transaction; it’s a signal within the complex crypto ecosystem. While the immediate impact might be muted, as suggested by the analyst’s “no sell-off” comment, it underscores the strategic maneuvers of major players and the increasing institutionalization of crypto assets. For MOVE token holders and the broader crypto community, staying informed, understanding market dynamics, and leveraging insights from on-chain analysis are crucial for navigating the ever-evolving tides of the cryptocurrency market. This strategic deposit could be a harbinger of future developments for MOVE and a testament to the growing sophistication of crypto market participants.

His last activity on X was in late February when he shared news about new liquidity pools on Shibarium. Although he continued to repost updates for a while, he completely disappeared from the platform after March 7—until now. A Cryptic Haiku to Address Concerns Kusama’s unexpected return came in the form of a cryptic Japanese haiku, which seemingly reassures the SHIB community that despite his silence, he remains vigilant. The short poem reads: “Footsteps fade, Yet souls remain, Under the same heaven.” This poetic message suggests that even in his absence, he has been keeping a watchful eye on the developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. His prolonged silence had fueled speculation and concern among community members, prompting questions about his whereabouts and plans for SHIB.

The SHIB team assured the community that there was no cause for concern, with one of its administrators, Vet Kusama, emphasizing that everything was proceeding as planned. Vet Kusama reassured followers by stating, “Don’t worry, more is on the way.” He further hinted at upcoming announcements and updates, adding, “When the silence is broken, everything will be great.” This statement suggests that significant developments are in the pipeline, awaiting the right moment for disclosure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Teasing Future SHIB Developments In an attempt to extract some details about what’s next for SHIB, Vet Kusama tagged both Shytoshi Kusama and lead developer Kaal Dhairya, urging them to reveal a glimpse of upcoming plans. “Please let me leak a few things @ShytoshiKusama and @kaaldhairya,” he wrote. However, both Kusama and Dhairya remained unresponsive, further building anticipation within the community. What’s Next for the Shiba Inu Ecosystem? While Kusama’s cryptic message did not directly provide details on future updates, it appears to have reassured the SHIB community that the project remains on track. Many now anticipate major announcements, potentially related to further Shibarium developments, ecosystem expansion, or strategic partnerships. For now, SHIB enthusiasts eagerly await the breaking of Kusama’s silence with more concrete updates, confident that when he does speak again, it will bring significant news for the Shiba Inu project.

Investors are attracted to Remittix because it demonstrates real-world usefulness combined with potential exponential growth which drives increased demand for such tokens in their portfolios. RTX stands among the top cryptocurrency choices to generate significant gains throughout 2025 because it surpasses Solana stability and Shiba Inu performance with its fundamentals rooted in Ethereum. Solana Price Prediction: Riding Out Storms in the Face of Remittix's Steady Growth Solana's price prediction is in the limelight as the altcoin market is going through a major change, with investors balancing its potential and limitations in the current volatile situation. Solana (SOL) stands at $138 as of today, a 4.5% drop on the day and 3% fall in trading volume to $3.26 billion a cautious whisper from the market following one rollercoaster month. Recent events ratchet up the risk: Solana's booming DeFi ecosystem outpaces Ethereum's growth, but Franklin Templeton points out its tokens lagging behind in value, emphasizing a confounding disconnect. Add Blackrock's on-ramp and ETF submissions to the equation and SOL's fate hangs in the balance of a fall to $120 come April's token unlock or a break above $200 if momentum continues. This volatility compels savvy investors to weigh Solana against Remittix's new potential. For Solana, the path forward is a tightrope: analysts estimate a 2025 range of above $150 to a bullish $520, depending on ETF hype and DeFi adoption. With such a fickle market, Solana's flash can dazzle or fade, Cardano's glacial speed can have staying power, but Remittix's utility can become the star of the show for those looking for the next champion. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can SHIB Overcome Meme Coin Volatility to Hit $0.0000728? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a 14% price increase to $0.0000144 during the last 7 days while maintaining its ""Dogecoin killer"" reputation. The price surge of Shiba Inu (SHIB) accompanies an overall meme coin rally that retail investors started buying as Bitcoin soared past $84,000. SHIB token saw its supply decrease by 12% through community burns after Shibarium L2 transactions crossed 400 million which indicates rising usage scenarios. The market capitalization of $8.5 billion demonstrates public belief in SHIB but the token lacks essential value which Ethereum-based DeFi meme coins like Remittix now demonstrate through core utility features. Based on CoinCodex analysis SHIB could reach $0.0000728 by December 2025 but will first need to break $0.000028 in the next 5 days while sustaining its burning pattern and integrating upcoming platform advancements which might push its value 385% higher. However, skepticism lingers, as SHIB’s 2024 gains lag behind rivals like Remittix, which have outperformed it by 200% year-to-date. Remittix Promises Better Upgrades Compared To Ripple The conversion from digital currencies to fiat money requires extended time especially as the withdrawal systems for XRP and similar coins suffer from complex withdrawal processes. Remittix puts an end to this bother by having a novel solution where XRP token holders can directly convert their coins into fiat money for instant cross-border bank transfers. Key to this disruption is Remittix's fast crypto-to-FIAT conversion system, which bypasses the multi-step procedure traditionally required to exchange digital money to cash. Rather than going through the arduous process of depositing XRP into an exchange, converting it into stablecoins, and going through withdrawal fees and processing time for bank wire transfers, Remittix offers a single interface that recognizes your XRP holdings. With over $14.1 million generated at presale and selling over 522 million RTX tokens with prices currently at $0.0734, the platform has gained a lot of investor trust. With such huge funds behind it, Remittix can establish strategic alliances, enhance compliance features and expand its outreach even further towards its marketing presence. The presale success and mass flood of money both show healthy marketplace confidence and validate Remittix's ability to deliver on its vision of instantaneous, affordable currency exchange.

In a new interview on CNBC, Mike Mayo, managing director and head of US large-cap bank research at Wells Fargo Securities, says he expects JPMorgan to report higher than expected earnings for Q1 2025. Beyond the bank’s earnings call on April 11, Mayo says JPMorgan could, more than any institution, benefit from an expected wave of deregulation coming to the financial industry promised by the new White House administration. “I had a conference last week with Wells Fargo’s research group. We had all sorts of Big Tech firms there. We had Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia. And you know what was interesting about that conference? It was the praise that JPMorgan got from Big Tech. So JPMorgan is the Nvidia of banking and you’re seeing growth in their consumer checking accounts two to three times faster than the industry. That’s over the next one to five years, but let’s talk about the next year. We updated our earnings estimate – and JPMorgan reports earnings for the first quarter two weeks from Friday – and I think those earnings will be strong. In addition, we upped our estimates for the next couple of years because JPMorgan is one of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation. So Goliath is winning when it comes to Tech and their share of gains, you have trading, strong earnings coming ahead and one of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation. So people are looking at little pieces of the market and banks and they’re missing the seismic shift that’s taking place at JPMorgan. [It’s a] best in class global bank that’s expanding its league.” At time of writing, shares of JPM are trading at $248, up 3% on the year.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) crashed below $84,000, down by over 5.5% from its highest point this week. Most altcoins also dropped, with the most notable laggards being Polygon ( POL ), JasmyCoin ( JASMY ), Bonk ( BONK ), and Injective ( INJ ), which crashed by over 10%. The main reason for the crypto market crash was a report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis that revealed that US inflation rose in February. That report raised the odds that the Federal Reserve will be more hawkish this year. However, a Bloomberg analyst expects the bank to cut rates rapidly in the second half of the year, saying : “With the Fed on hold for now, they’ll likely need to cut rates in the second half of the year more quickly — and likely by more — than the latest dot plot shows they anticipate.” Further, Donald Trump’s Liberation Day is nearing. In addition to the automobile tariffs announced this week, Trump has pledged to implement reciprocal tariffs on allies and foes. You might also like: PENGU dives as Pudgy Penguins sales, floor price crashes The crypto market also dropped even as a team from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE arrived at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump has tasked Musk to shake up all parts of the Federal Government. According to its website , Musk’s operation has saved taxpayers over $130 billion. DOGE’s arrival at the SEC is notable because the agency is tasked with policing the financial market, including crypto. For example, the agency is now investigating tens of spot crypto ETF filings by companies like Canary, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. It is not clear which savings DOGE will recommend at the agency, though data shows that 500 workers have accepted voluntary buyouts and deferred-resignation offers. The arrival also happened a day after Paul Atkins was grilled in Congress. With Republicans in control, the odds are that he will be approved to be the next SEC Chair. The SEC has become a more friendly place for cryptocurrencies under Trump. It has hinted that it will approve many crypto ETFs, and most importantly, it has ended the lawfare against many crypto companies like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap.

While some traders are running after those tokens that have already made it big, there are others that are ahead of the curve—seeking assets with solid fundamentals and upside potential. Among those that are picking up speed is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02 still in presale. With a projected return of 17x, it’s now considered one of the leaders to lift off in the coming cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t a meme token or a hype-driven flash in the pan. It’s a decentralized protocol focused on lending, borrowing, and passive yield—an area of DeFi with consistent demand, especially during periods of renewed market activity. The platform is designed to give users direct access to on-chain financial tools, allowing them to supply or borrow assets through smart contracts while maintaining control of their funds. What’s fueling the bullish outlook is more than just narrative. The presale is in the last leg of its third phase, with more than $5.3 million of funds raised, 7,100+ investors in possession of the tokens, and 95% of the round now complete. Once it closes, there is a price spike to $0.025, with the launch price set at $0.06. That launch already is a 3x return from here—but analysts and the early investors are looking further out. With a fully functioning platform expected to go live in beta by launch, and a clear roadmap ahead, projections of a 17x move aren’t just speculative—they’re tied to planned utility. So, what makes Mutuum different? At its core, it offers two flexible lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to deposit assets into shared liquidity pools. In return, they receive mtTokens that symbolize their deposit and gain value as interest. The framework facilitates pool-based passive income based on usage, with rates consistently adjusting as borrowing volume changes. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) establishes bilateral lending arrangements. Here, lenders and borrowers can negotiate between themselves on terms of their choice, ideal for tokens that might not be suitable for standard pools—e.g., DOGE, PEPE, or other niche digital assets. Everything is on-chain, offering transparency and flexibility. Mutuum is also designed with token holders in mind. Part of the platform’s fees will be used to buy MUTM on the open market and subsequently distribute the tokens to stakers of their mtTokens. This creates constant demand for MUTM while rewarding those who are actively participating in the ecosystem—a system that encourages long-term participation and longevity. The additional dose of trust comes in the form of the team’s strategy, where they will launch a beta version of the platform prior to when the token hits the market. That is, the project is not going to come into the market with mere promises—it is going to launch with working features, giving the project a concrete ground for user adoption and value creation from day one. And to celebrate the growth of the community, Mutuum has also rolled out a $100,000 giveaway. It’s targeting early adopters who believe in the project and would want to be included in the launch momentum. Active participants who join the platform within this time will stand a chance to win rewards, making it an excellent incentive to join prior to when the token goes into public markets. With utility at its core, a structured presale, and a clear product on the way, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly moving from under-the-radar to must-watch status. For investors scanning the market for the next high-potential mover, this $0.02 token may not stay underpriced for long. As the presale window closes, the chance to lock in before the next price jump—and before public trading begins—might be one of the strongest plays ahead of the next wave of DeFi growth.

Cardano (ADA), meanwhile, sits at $0.77 thanks to whale accumulation and speculation over ETF application. However, while all of this is going on, investor chatter is increasingly centering around Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new decentralized lending project that has a presale rocking over 7400 holders and $5.7 million in commitments. Now in Phase 4 priced at $0.025, MUTM’s trajectory is very different to the gradual climbs of XRP and ADA, providing immediate upside potential going into its exchange debut. Ripple (XRP): Positive Developments in Legal Proceedings On a more positive note, Ripple scored a partial victory earlier this month in a high-profile legal case against the SEC, paying a $50 million fine for not violating hedging laws on institutional sales. Now trading at $2.42, the token hovers near mid-Bollinger Bands — a point of indecision. As a breakout above $2.60 could justify bullish predictions, the long shadow of a three-year court battle lingers over its momentum. The 0.52% daily loss from XRP reflects traders still jittery and many who now prefer assets free from regulatory friction. Cardano (ADA): ETF Hype vs Market Realities The 10% weekly uptick to $0.7690 also reflects renewed interest in Cardano, sparked by whale buys of a whopping 240 million ADA and speculation over a potential ETF. Technical indicators such as green bars in MACD and RSI at nearly 65 point towards upward momentum, but ADA is still far from its peak of 2021. The token’s dependence on larger market trends and possible (but no guarantees of) speculative ETF approvals, analysts say. For investors valuing speed, Cardano’s measured rise is comparatively slow compared to presale gains such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where entry time directly correlates to returns. Momentum for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ’s presale is now on Phase 4, with its tokens priced at $0.025 — an amount set to rise 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5. As an initial participant you already have 140% gains already before listing at $0.06 on exchange, its a baseline return that is written in its tokenomics. The project raised funds quickly — $5.7 million — indicating an increased demand: 7400 holders profiting from structured price increases. With Phase 4’s low supply now in decline, investors are coming to expect not just gains from the launch, but ongoing growth based on Mutuum’s lending ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart through a self-reinforcing economic model. Earnings from the decentralized lending side of the business are used to initiate MUTM buybacks on a monthly basis, distributing tokens to mtToken stakers as well as providing a constant buy pressure on the market. Combined with overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending alternatives, this model drives utility-oriented demand that is missing from speculative competitors. Moreover, mtTokens, an interest-bearing asset that represents a user deposit, can create passive income streams, which further encourages engagement with the platform. To mark progress towards launch, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) developers are currently finalizing a smart contract audit with Certik, a milestone likely to encourage investor confidence. The team’s ethos of transparency will guide pre-and post-audit announcements clarifying the security protocols implemented. Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) are both stuck in a cycle of fractional gains over the past months and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the few projects that offers both an easy entry point as well as a serious upside. Today Phase 4 is nearly full, the opportunity to purchase tokens at just $0.025 — and position yourself for pre-launch profits — is closing quickly. Looking for high-reward investments now for 2025, investors are switching-and flocking-to MUTM, a contract between presale dynamics and real world usefulness.

Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee were especially interested in hearing about how Atkins, who served as a commissioner at the SEC under former President Bush, felt securities regulators handled market risks before the 2008 financial crisis. Atkins has historically maintained that the 2008 crash had “many causes,” but “deregulation,” as top Committee Democrat Elizabeth Warren suggested, was not one. Read more: What SEC chair nominee Paul Atkins has previously said about crypto “What really troubles me is that Congress still has yet to address the real root cause, and that was the subprime mortgage crisis,” Atkins added. Some senators mentioned digital assets, and Atkins himself even took a moment to acknowledge the industry in his prepared remarks at the start of the hearing. He did not however face any specific inquiries about his plans for regulating the asset class. Atkins hopes to provide “clear rules of the road” for crypto companies, he said. Committee Chair Sen. Tim Scott said he hopes Atkins and Comptroller of the Currency nominee Jonathan Gould work to address unfair discrimination against cryptocurrency firms, particularly when it comes to banking. Sen. Elizabeth Warren in her opening statement accused Atkins of “helping billionaire CEOs like Sam Bankman-Fried.” She added that his personal business dealings present conflicts of interest she feels he has not adequately addressed. Atkins, who founded consulting firm Patomak Global Partners after his first stint at the SEC, has a net worth of at least $327 million, according to filings with the Office of Government Ethics. Atkins has said he will sell his stake in the company should he be confirmed, but he did not confirm if he would publicly reveal the details of such a deal. “No, you’re not going to tell us how much money you get — to people who will have business in front of the SEC?” Warren wondered in relation to these potential buyers. “You know, some people might call that a pre-bribe.” Get the news in your inbox.

Coldware (COLD) represents a unique mobile-oriented blockchain protocol to gain institutional and retail users through its cutting-edge features. Many users now consider Coldware the superior choice since Pi Network has failed to meet its promised outcomes. The following article reveals the reasons along with steps to participate in the Coldware (COLD) ecosystem. Coldware: Redefining Mobile Blockchain Technology The Coldware (COLD) is more than a simple crypto project because it functions as a comprehensive mobile-oriented ecosystem built through original development. The proof-of-stake (PoS) Layer-1 blockchain design behind Coldware enables its systems to handle high volumes of transactions cost-effectively as well as efficiently manage power consumption. Its standout features include: Litenodes: They serve as portable hardware applications that grant smartphone users the power to maintain decentralization. Decentralized dApp Store: A marketplace for innovative, mobile-native applications. PayFi Capabilities: Built-in financial tools for seamless, low-fee payments. The $COLD token provides the foundation for this ecosystem to run all operations which include staking functions and access to dApps and enables users to interact with IoT devices such as Larna 2400® smartphones and ColdBook laptops. The $COLD token was built to solve existing problems across DeFi environments as well as gaming systems and the Internet of Things. The platform’s new mobile application attracts early adopters, particularly those using the outdated mobile platform Pi Network who are seeking better services. Why PI Whales Are Shifting to Coldware The primary launch of Pi Network’s mainnet was expected to be transformational yet the experience has proven extremely challenging. The PI token presents at a price range between $0.84 and $0.85 on March 27 2025 yet it has undergone a price decline of more than 70% from its peak in February. In the past day, whale investors have shown minor interest with a 3% increase in their PI holdings although their larger stakes show signs of impatience. Consumer interest in Coldware (COLD) continues to rise because they find attractive features which include: Lightweight Mobile Nodes: Offering decentralization without the heavy resource demands of traditional blockchains. DePin Utility uses decentralized physical infrastructure to create practical applications for users. Mobile devices now enable users to avail themselves of staking and earn rewards within their devices. The growth of Coldware demonstrates its ability to create a practical mobile blockchain solution that Pi Network has not successfully implemented. The Web3 sectors including gaming, DeFi and IoT drive PI whales to choose Coldware (COLD) as their resource while they pursue long-term success and enhanced performance metrics. PI Network’s Post-Launch Struggles The beginning of Pi Network in 2019 brought about drastic shifts throughout its existence. The promised accessible mobile mining aspect which made Pi Network famous failed to deliver when the mainnet launched on February 2025. Key challenges include: The validator system faces backlash criticism because genuine decentralization is absent leading the crypto community to lose its core members. The rejection of PI by Binance exchange might have resulted from their mainnet being closed and their governance being centralized which created exchange listing doubts. The steep decline beyond 70% on the market reflects how holding PI tokens no longer receives widespread support from investors. The domain auctions under the .pi domain generated brief market attention yet these sales did not manage to build enduring community trust. The community faces confusion because of the lack of official updates and enduring debates about utility which led whales to seek opportunities elsewhere. How to Join the Coldware Ecosystem The beginning phase of the Coldware presale presents easy ways to join specifically through its official website at coldware. network. Here’s a step-by-step guide: Go to the Coldware website here Choose a wallet for your account including MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Select payment method from available crypto options. Purchase $COLD tokens. The user dashboard allows you to monitor your purchasing progress of $COLD Tokens which becomes available for claim before their official launch. The fast-growing Coldware ecosystem demonstrates speed through its present presale stage which has earned almost $760,000 from its 21 billion $COLD total supply. Beyond its monetary value, the platform stands out through its mission to develop complete decentralization in user-driven software that provides practical solutions beyond what Pi Network currently provides. Conclusion: The Future Belongs to Utility and Decentralization The diminished interest in Pi Network creates an opportunity for Coldware (COLD) to establish its position in the market. The PI whales who are diversifying their investments while accelerating the presale have demonstrated that blockchain success relies on utility-driven decentralized mobile-first platforms. The token functions as a symbol which represents a major push toward developing an accessible and working Web3 ecosystem.

Traders and investors are now eyeing these digital assets with curiosity. Are they setting the stage for a potential upward movement? This article delves into the current status of these coins, exploring whether a bullish trend might be on the horizon. Jupiter (JUP) Market Overview: Past Trends and Key Levels Jupiter experienced a 21.54% drop over the last month and a 40.28% decline in the past six months, with a modest 3.98% gain in one week. The price movement shows that volatility has been prominent, indicating the challenges faced by the asset. The recent small uptick could potentially be temporary, as the overall trend remains weak. The current price range is between $0.57 and $1.01, with key resistance at $1.26 and a second barrier at $1.71. Support holds at $0.38. Bears continue to dominate the market, though a slight upward momentum is indicated by an RSI of 44.89. Trading strategies could focus on short positions near resistance levels and looking for entry points near support if a reversal appears possible. Toncoin Price Dynamics: Short-Term Surge Amid Long-Term Pressure Toncoin gained momentum recently with a 14.31% jump in the past month and a healthy 9.59% rise over the week, though it has slipped 31.06% in the last six months. This pattern shows rapid, recent recovery despite a broader, challenging trend over half a year. Volatile swings have defined its performance, signaling both potential rebound and underlying bearish pressure. Current trading sees Toncoin priced between $2.53 and $4.52, with immediate resistance at $5.72 and a secondary barrier at $7.71, while support is solid at $1.72. Indicators suggest bulls are present, yet the overall trend remains uncertain. Traders may look to buy near support and consider profit-taking near resistance. Conclusion Both JUP and TON have shown resilience by holding essential support levels after a drop. If these levels continue to hold, a potential rally could be on the horizon. The stability signals investor confidence and suggests a possible uptrend. Continued monitoring will determine if this leads to significant gains.

This new policy shift signals a change in the FDIC’s approach to the growing role of digital assets in the banking sector. New FDIC Guidelines on Crypto-Related Activities The FDIC has issued a new Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), which provides updated guidance for banks looking to engage in cryptocurrency activities. The new guidance rescinds the previous policy set out in FIL-16-2022, which required banks to notify the FDIC before engaging in such activities. Under the new rules, banks can now participate in permissible crypto-related activities without waiting for FDIC approval, as long as they manage the risks appropriately. This change is seen as a shift in the FDIC’s stance, following the agency’s earlier stance that required prior approval for crypto engagements. FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill expressed that this new approach aims to establish a more consistent framework for banks to explore and adopt emerging technologies like crypto-assets and blockchain. “With today’s action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,” said Hill in a statement.

The SkyBridge Capital founder’s call for the abolishing of the law comes in the wake of the New York Attorney General’s $200 million settlement settlement with Galaxy Digital . And it all relates to the collapsed LUNA ( LUNA ) token. In a post on X , Scaramucci, labelled the Martin Act as a “dangerously powerful” law whose application is likely to be abused and lead to legal overreach. The Martin Act allows the NYAG to bring lawsuits against parties deemed to have violated its stipulations, but according to Scaramucci, the sweeping authority allowed the AG in terms of investigation and penalties can be abused. With no need to prove intent, the Act comes short. It’s “low standard of proof” is what the SkyBridge Capital founder says is dangerous. To him, this law “shouldn’t exist,” and NYAG’s use of the Act to reach the $200 million settlement with Galaxy Digital is “lawfare pure and simple.” He added that the case and the settlement is at odds with actions taken by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. You might also like: Terraform to dissolve following $4.47b settlement with SEC “This makes no sense and is completely at odds with the SEC and DOJ which have been pursuing actions against Do Kwon and Terraform,” he posted. “It’s [lawfare] pure and simple due to an obscure but dangerously powerful New York law known as the Martin Act. The law has no need to prove intent, creating a low standard of proof that can open the door for abuse like this. It shouldn’t exist.” In its investigation, the NYAG alleged financial misconduct on the part of Galaxy Digital, claiming the firm’s marketing of LUNA eventually harmed retail. The crypto project’s collapse in May 2022 saw more than $40 billion in value vanish into thin air. Scaramucci says Galaxy Digital and its chief executive Michael Novogratz were deceived by bad actors – Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon . “Novogratz is a dear friend and one of the smartest investors I know. Everything he ever said about Luna was because he thought it was true based on the deception perpetrated by the real bad actors here, Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.” Despite the sentiment on the Martin Act, Scaramucci’s remarks on Novogratz have largely been criticized on social media. Many say Galaxy Digital “was paid” to pump LUNA and it reaped huge profits as alleged in the investigation.

If selling pressure increases, the $80K support level could be the next target in the coming days. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart BTC’s recent bullish retracement has lost momentum after briefly surpassing the 200-day moving average at $85K, leading to a minor rejection. This price action suggests a potential false breakout and a bull trap, highlighting the presence of sellers. The current retracement appears to be corrective, and if selling pressure intensifies, a drop toward the critical $80K support level could unfold in the short term. However, if unexpected buying pressure emerges, a breakout above this level could trigger a short squeeze, pushing Bitcoin to new highs. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin continues its downtrend within a descending price channel, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, reinforcing a bearish market structure. Although BTC recently attempted a bullish retracement, momentum faded upon reaching the channel’s upper boundary at $88K, confirming strong resistance. The rejection at this level has triggered renewed bearish pressure, increasing the likelihood of continued consolidation within the channel. In the short term, the $80K support, aligned with the channel’s mid-boundary, remains the primary downside target. On-chain Analysis By Shayan Futures market sentiment has consistently offered valuable insights into Bitcoin’s price trends, with funding rates serving as a key indicator of market dominance. Recent data shows a decline in funding rates, nearing zero, signaling a shift toward seller dominance. While this might seem bearish at first, it mirrors the market behavior seen in the summer of 2024, when Bitcoin underwent a prolonged correction before rallying strongly. This pattern suggests that BTC may have entered a deep consolidation phase, potentially lasting through the mid-to-long term before resuming its upward trajectory.

The appearance of prominent figures from the cryptosphere on the cover of Forbes has long been a superstition. And for good reason - just look at what happened to the price of bitcoin after the issues with ”cryptocelebrities”. The history of these coincidences is a fascinating one. Changpeng Zhao - the first swallow of the ”cover curse” - appeared on Forbes in February 2018. By then, the bear market had already begun its march, with bitcoin losing more than half of its value from its December 2017 highs. But that was just the beginning of the drama - ahead of it was another drop, this time by as much as 60%. The next ”lucky” person was Sam Bankman-Fried, whose face appeared on the cover in October 2021. As if at the snap of a finger, the market plunged into a bear cycle, and a year later, bam! - the FTX bankruptcy rumbled on. Bitcoin has collapsed a whopping 77% from its November 2021 peak. January 2025 - and already Michael Saylor is looking at us from the glossy cover. It's hard to say for sure whether the bear cycle started then, but the fact remains that after this issue the market went into correction. Bitcoin has sagged 30% from its January highs. And now, in March 2025, Justin Sun took up the baton.... You can, of course, dismiss it all as an amusing coincidence. You can argue that Forbes is just a barometer of popularity, recording the peak interest in a person. And peak interest often coincides with local market highs - a pattern as simple as two times two. But isn't it interesting how this strange correlation works? It's as if the editors of Forbes have an uncanny knack for timing - right before a market crash. Or maybe it is the market itself that reacts to the appearance of another crypto-deity on the cover? The question is rhetorical, but definitely entertaining. Statistics are stubborn things: three out of three cases were accompanied by a significant drop. Will Justin Sun be the fourth in this unhappy sequence or will he be able to break the ”cover curse”?",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 17:44:36

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) is trading near $0.24.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|EXCHANGE|BNB|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-28 17:47:28

The involved assets experienced enhanced volatility, and surprisingly, some of them headed south. The Massive Volatility The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange frequently amends its services to offer enhanced user experience and respond to the latest market trends. Most recently, it added the meme coins Mubarak (MUBARAK), CZ’s Dog (BROCCOLI714), Tutorial (TUT), and Banana for Scale (BANANAS31) to its Binance Simple Earn section. Moreover, the tokens will soon be included in the “Buy Crypto,” Binance Convert, Binance Margin, and Binance Auto-Invest programs. Support from a crypto behemoth like Binance usually has a huge positive effect on the involved digital assets due to increased liquidity and boosted accessibility. The price of Tutorial (TUT) has exploded by an impressive 130% in the past 24 hours, while BROCCOLI714 has pumped by 15% for the same period. TUT Price, Source: CoinGecko Somewhat surprisingly, though, MUBARAK and BANANAS31 have registered steep declines. The former has lost over 40% of its valuation in the last 24 hours, while the latter is down by approximately 13%. It is worth mentioning that MUBARAK’s valuation reacted quite differently in mid-March when Binance introduced MUBARAK/USDT perpetual contracts with up to 25x leverage. The price skyrocketed by double digits shortly after the inclusion. Another factor that may have contributed to the meme coin’s substantial resurgence back then is the involvement of Binance’s founder – Changpeng Zhao (known as CZ). According to Lookonchain, he spent 1 BNB to buy MUBARAK and the same amount to purchase TST. Previous Binance Announcements Another cryptocurrency that witnessed a serious spike after a recent Binance listing is StraitsX USD (XUSD). Last week, the stablecoin, which is pegged to the American dollar and supposed to hover around $1, soared to almost $1.80 after the exchange launched the XUSD/USDT trading pair. The peak was short-lived, and in the following hours, the price returned to its target. Binance also seemed very close to embracing Pi Network’s native token – PI. In February, it held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see the coin available for trading, and over 86% of the voters clicked the “yes” option. Regardless of the overwhelming support, it remains unclear whether the exchange will respect their wish.

To read full editions, subscribe . On Thursday’s ACD call, Ethereum core developers reaffirmed their intent to ship Full EOF (EVM object format) with the Fusaka fork alongside the PeerDAS main driver. (Ipsilon wrote up a thorough review of the options, with Full EOF referred to as “Option A.”) EOF is a major overhaul of the EVM that aims for long-term optimization, safety and modularity of Ethereum’s execution engine. Its scope has stirred controversy . Felix (from the Geth team) backed the more moderate Option D, putting him slightly at odds with fellow Geth college Lightclients. From outside the client teams, Pascal Caversaccio voiced strong opposition, following up on his published critique : “EOF: When Complexity Outweighs Necessity.” His main claim: No application developers are asking for EOF, and its rollout risks alienating the broader dev community. Despite this, EF staff — including Piper Merriam and Ansgar Dietrichs, as well as client teams like Besu and Erigon — stood behind Full EOF. Their reasoning: It’s a clean structural reset, demanded by compiler authors, and backward-compatible for developers preferring the legacy EVM. Tim Beiko acknowledged the complexity, but noted it emerged from years of iterative work. “We can’t decide not to do something just because it’s complex,” he told participants on the call. “Long live Full EOF,” cheered Merriam. So EOF is coming. For developers, the negotiation phase seems over, and the upgrade’s next chapter will focus on implementation and testing. Get the news in your inbox.

Pi Network, Cardano, and XYZVerse May Reach It First appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Speculation surrounds certain cryptocurrencies reaching the $5 mark. Many anticipate XRP as the frontrunner, but some believe other digital coins might achieve this milestone sooner. Emerging platforms like Pi Network, established ones like Cardano, and the newcomer XYZVerse are gaining attention. This overview delves into their potential and why they might outpace expectations. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.003333 Next Stage : $0.005 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $10 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! XRP and the XRP Ledger: Fast, Low-Cost, Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It was created to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. XRP is designed as a digitally native, programmable currency resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. The XRP Ledger is decentralized, with no central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. Settlements do not require a bank account. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. It was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. Of these, 80 billion were gifted to Ripple, a company that uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to release supply in a controlled manner. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” reflecting its aim to facilitate payment transfers across various currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP’s technology continues to facilitate quick and cost-effective transactions. Its potential applications in global payments and remittances may contribute to its utility. The network’s features, such as fast settlement times and low fees, can be attractive for users seeking efficient cross-border transfers. The decentralized system without the need for a central authority might appeal to those valuing security and resistance to censorship. Pi Network: A Mobile-First Approach to Accessible Cryptocurrency Pi Network is a platform that enables users to mine Pi tokens using their smartphones without the need for specialized hardware. Founded in 2019 by Stanford graduates, it aims to make cryptocurrency accessible to a broader audience. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof of work system, Pi uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is more energy-efficient. Users earn Pi by verifying their daily presence on the app and by building trust circles with 3-5 reliable contacts. These trust circles form a global trust graph that secures the network and validates transactions without requiring massive computing power. The network is currently operating on its Mainnet blockchain in an “enclosed” period. During this phase, users must complete know your customer verification to transfer their mined Pi to the blockchain. The project plans to transition to an “open network” phase, allowing full external connectivity. Pi Network’s approach offers fair access to digital currency without draining mobile battery life. Its energy-efficient mining and community-based security model present a unique perspective in the cryptocurrency landscape. The technology’s potential lies in its focus on accessibility and sustainability, which may appeal to users interested in a more inclusive digital economy. Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications. It utilizes a proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros, which is more energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work systems. The platform is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer manages smart contracts. This architecture enhances scalability, potentially enabling the processing of up to a million transactions per second. The native cryptocurrency of Cardano is ADA, which allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano native tokens provide secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. The platform’s sustainable approach and scalability make it a noteworthy player in the cryptocurrency market. In comparison to other platforms, Cardano aims to offer more efficient and environmentally friendly solutions for decentralized finance, token creation, and gaming. The attractiveness of ADA in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including technological developments and market conditions. As with any cryptocurrency, potential users and investors may consider these aspects when evaluating ADA. Conclusion In the bullish market, XRP, Pi Network, and Cardano are promising, but XYZVerse’s community-driven sports-meme ecosystem aims for 20,000% growth, positioning it as a potential standout.

This marks a reversal from previous policies that were seen as restrictive toward banks working with crypto firms. The guidance , released in Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025), rescinds a 2022 directive that required banks to notify the FDIC before engaging in digital asset activities. The FDIC stated that banks may now participate in crypto-related ventures as long as they effectively manage associated risks.

These documents were made public in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Coinbase , which sued the FDIC in 2024 over alleged unfair practices. “With today’s action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,” said Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.” The records detail instances of the FDIC instructing banks to pause or suspend services to crypto-related businesses, a practice that critics dubbed “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” The agency frequently cited reputational risks and market volatility as reasons for discouraging financial institutions from working with crypto firms. The FDIC indicated it will continue working with the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and collaborate with other banking agencies to develop clearer guidance on crypto-related activities.

Today, March 28, 2025, the overall market witnessed a significant price decline. Amid this, Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest digital asset, has finally lost its support and is now poised for a massive price drop. Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, between late February and early March 2025, BTC witnessed impressive upside momentum while forming a bearish rising price action pattern on the daily timeframe. The BTC price has now broken out of the pattern, partially confirming its bearish outlook and opening the path for further price decline. Source: Trading View Based on historical price momentum, if the BTC price continues to fall and closes a four-hour candle below the $83,500 mark, there is a strong possibility that it could drop by 6%, reaching the $78,500 level. Following the breakdown, the asset has also fallen below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a weak and bearish trend. Current Price Momentum Bitcoin is currently trading near $83,850 and has recorded a 4% price decline in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 25%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Traders Bearish Outlook Meanwhile, looking at the bearish market trend and continuous price decline, traders strongly capitalizing on the trend appear to be betting on the short side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data reveals that traders are currently over-leveraged at $86,000, where they have built $1.26 billion worth of short positions, hoping that the BTC price won’t cross this level anytime soon. Meanwhile, $83,500 is another over-leveraged level where traders have built $345 million worth of long positions, which are on the verge of liquidation and will be liquidated if the BTC price crosses this level.

Built on Circle’s programmable wallet tech , the Baanx platform allows crypto holders access to cashback, fee discounts, subscription perks and exclusive gated experiences, according to a press release. An ongoing convergence between traditional card networks and the on-chain world of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) has seen Mastercard partner with Web3 wallet MetaMask, and more recently reports of Visa in talks with Sam Altman’s World Network. The rewards wallet offering helps bridge the gap between blockchain and everyday financial needs, said Baanx Chief Commercial Officer Simon Jones. “We've built the Rewards Wallet using Circle to offer rewards on a crypto debit card that are unprecedented, and so incentivizing users to go down the route of non-custodial spend,” Jones said in an interview. “For instance, if you look at the MataMask card, it’s up to 6% cash-back for the first month.” Circle, famous as the creator of the $60 billion stablecoin USDC, offers programmable wallet infrastructure that allows for adding features to multiple crypto projects without having to change the user interface, Jones said. “We are pushing USDC as the main treasury token and incentive program within these products, as opposed to Tether [USDT],” he said. Sanja Kon, VP of partnerships & business development, Europe at Circle said in a statement: “Circle Wallets provide a fantastic foundation for the Rewards Wallet.

33767162,[object Object],1743184821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Shiba Inu Price Set To Repeat History? Falling Wedge Pattern Shows A Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-to-repeat-history/,"A new technical analysis on TradingView suggests that Shiba Inu’s recent price movements may be echoing a familiar structure from earlier last year, raising the possibility of history repeating itself. The analyst examined Shiba Inu’s chart from November 2024 to the present and pointed out a sequence of patterns that also appeared between March and November 2024, patterns that preceded a significant rally. The analysis outlines a clear path that could lead to a notable price surge towards $0.00003 if these price patterns continue to play out. Pattern Analysis Suggests Shiba Inu May Be Ready For A Big Upside Move The entire analysis is grounded on the idea that crypto markets are cyclical and exhibit recurring behaviors, crowd psychology, and recognizable chart patterns. Notably, this analysis uses four distinct pattern stages that played out on the Shiba Inu daily candlestick timeframe chart. The TradingView analyst began by highlighting the completion of a falling wedge pattern in SHIB’s price chart, which is a classic bullish reversal setup. The analyst noted that this same structure played out from March 2024 to September 2024, acting as a precursor to a breakout in the weeks that followed. As of now, Shiba Inu seems to have moved past that initial wedge stage, making way for the second stage, which has been identified as a cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern, which was observed and confirmed recently, also mirrors the meme coin’s formation back in August 2024, when a brief consolidation phase eventually gave way to an upward move. The analyst believes that the chart has now entered what they describe as “Stage 3,” a phase where a W-shaped formation may emerge. Historically, this pattern aligned with a powerful uptrend in September 2024 when SHIB experienced a multi-week rally. Breakout Could Be Coming Next Although pattern repetition isn’t guaranteed, the analyst’s comparison of current and past formations presents an interesting narrative that bullish traders will be interested in. If the final stage plays out as the analyst expects, Shiba Inu could soon form an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, which is one of the strongest bullish reversal signals in technical analysis. This pattern was last spotted as stage 4 just before a rally that brought the Shiba Inu price above $0.00003 in December 2024. Based on this four-stage progression, the trader is projecting a 91% rally from here, which could lift SHIB to $0.0000335. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001340, meaning the token is still in the early phase of this anticipated pattern sequence.

The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) is making waves with its ambitious plan to launch its very own UAE digital currency , the digital dirham, in the fourth quarter of 2025. This exciting development, reported by Cointelegraph and Khaleej Times, signals the UAE’s commitment to embracing digital innovation and solidifying its position as a forward-thinking global financial hub. But what exactly does this mean for you, and what are the potential implications of this digital transformation? Let’s dive into the details. What is the Digital Dirham and Why is the UAE Launching a Central Bank Digital Currency? A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) , like the digital dirham, is essentially a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, in this case, the UAE dirham. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are decentralized, a CBDC is issued and regulated by the central bank. Think of it as a digital version of the physical dirham notes and coins you use every day, but designed for the digital age. So, why is the CBUAE taking this leap into the digital realm? According to reports, CBUAE Governor Khaled Mohammed Balama emphasized that the digital dirham is designed to: Enhance Financial Stability: By providing a secure and efficient digital payment system, the digital dirham can contribute to a more stable and resilient financial infrastructure. Prevent Financial Crimes: The transparent and traceable nature of digital currencies can make it harder for illicit activities like money laundering and fraud to thrive. These are significant benefits, but the move towards a UAE digital currency is also part of a broader global trend. Many countries are exploring or have already launched CBDCs, recognizing their potential to modernize payment systems and improve financial inclusion. The UAE doesn’t want to be left behind in this digital revolution. The Benefits of a Digital Dirham: A Closer Look The introduction of a digital dirham could bring a plethora of advantages to the UAE economy and its residents. Let’s explore some key benefits: Faster and More Efficient Payments: Imagine instant transactions, 24/7, without the delays associated with traditional banking systems. The digital dirham promises to streamline payments, making them faster and more efficient for businesses and consumers alike. Reduced Transaction Costs: Digital transactions can significantly reduce the costs associated with physical cash handling, interbank transfers, and payment processing fees. This can lead to savings for both businesses and individuals. Increased Financial Inclusion: A digital dirham can provide access to financial services for the unbanked and underbanked populations. With just a mobile phone, individuals can participate in the digital economy, promoting greater financial inclusion. Enhanced Security and Transparency: CBDCs are designed with robust security features, and their transactions are recorded on a digital ledger, providing greater transparency and reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting. Boost to Innovation and the Digital Economy: A UAE digital currency can foster innovation in the fintech sector, paving the way for new digital payment solutions and services. It can also accelerate the growth of the UAE’s digital economy as a whole. Navigating the Challenges: What are the Potential Hurdles? While the prospects of a digital dirham are exciting, there are also challenges that the CBUAE will need to address to ensure a successful launch and widespread adoption. Some potential hurdles include: Cybersecurity Risks: As with any digital system, cybersecurity is paramount. Protecting the digital dirham infrastructure from cyberattacks and ensuring the security of user wallets and transactions is crucial. Data Privacy Concerns: The digital nature of CBDCs raises questions about data privacy. Striking a balance between transparency and protecting user data will be essential to build public trust. Technological Infrastructure: Implementing a CBDC requires robust technological infrastructure. The CBUAE needs to ensure that the technology is scalable, reliable, and accessible to all users across the UAE. User Adoption and Education: For the digital dirham to be successful, widespread user adoption is necessary. Public education campaigns will be needed to familiarize people with the new currency and its benefits. Integration with Existing Financial Systems: Seamless integration of the digital dirham with existing banking and financial systems is vital to ensure a smooth transition and avoid disruptions. The Global CBDC Landscape: How Does the UAE Compare? The UAE is not alone in its journey towards a CBDC. Many countries around the world are actively exploring or have already launched their own digital currencies. Here’s a quick comparison: Country/Region CBDC Status Name (if applicable) China Pilot Phase Digital Yuan (e-CNY) Nigeria Launched eNaira Bahamas Launched Sand Dollar European Central Bank Exploration Phase Digital Euro United States Research Phase Digital Dollar (potential) UAE Development Phase Digital Dirham As you can see, the UAE is joining a growing global movement. Learning from the experiences of other countries and tailoring its approach to its specific needs will be crucial for the successful implementation of the UAE digital currency . What Does the Digital Dirham Mean for Crypto Adoption in the UAE? The launch of a digital dirham could have significant implications for crypto adoption in the UAE. On one hand, it might be seen as competition to existing cryptocurrencies. However, it could also pave the way for greater acceptance and understanding of digital assets in general. Here’s how the digital dirham could influence crypto adoption : Increased Digital Literacy: The introduction of a CBDC will necessitate greater digital literacy among the population. As people become more comfortable using digital currencies, they may be more open to exploring other forms of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Clarity: The CBUAE’s move towards a CBDC signals a proactive approach to digital assets. This could lead to greater regulatory clarity for the broader cryptocurrency market in the UAE, fostering a more conducive environment for innovation and investment. Potential Integration: In the future, there could be potential for integration between the digital dirham and certain regulated cryptocurrencies. This could create new opportunities for interoperability and innovation within the digital asset space. While the exact impact on crypto adoption remains to be seen, the UAE digital currency initiative is undoubtedly a significant step forward for the digital asset ecosystem in the region. The Future is Digital: Embracing the Digital Dirham The Central Bank of the UAE’s plan to launch the digital dirham in Q4 2025 is a bold and transformative move. It reflects the UAE’s commitment to innovation, financial stability, and embracing the future of finance. While challenges exist, the potential benefits of a UAE digital currency are substantial, ranging from enhanced payment efficiency and reduced costs to increased financial inclusion and a boost to the digital economy. As the UAE embarks on this exciting journey, the world will be watching closely. The successful implementation of the digital dirham could serve as a model for other countries considering their own CBDCs and further solidify the UAE’s position as a leader in the digital age. The digital revolution in finance is underway, and the UAE is taking a decisive step into this exciting new era.

The cloud computing firm had sold roughly 37.5 million shares at $40 each , raising about $1.5 billion for its initial public offering (IPO), making it the largest tech offering since 2021. It had, however, initially planned to file the offering at $47 to $55 a share at a much higher valuation than it ultimately saw. Nvidia, an early investor in the company, placed a $250 million order in the offering. Some experts speculated that the stock’s debut wouldn’t see the success it had hoped for. Bloomberg Opinion US technology columnist Dave Lee, for example, pointed out the company’s large debt, reliance on just a few big customers and lack of diversity in revenue may be an issue. “CoreWeave stands to be a bellwether for the AI industry as a whole — a must-watch stock as questions about return on investment grow ever louder,” Lee wrote in an op-ed on Friday. “Even the slightest indication of shakiness in the belief of AI sends investors into a tailspin.” The current risk-off environment caused by the overall macro situation in the U.S., mainly due to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which has caused a sell off in tech stocks, could also have weighed on CoreWeave’s IPO.",Markets|Coreweave,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-28 18:02:54

Traders are divided about Bitcoin’s price trajectory in 2025.

Coutts told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high above $109,000 before the end of the second quarter. He added that a lack of clarity on the US tariffs and recession concerns are unlikely to derail the potential Bitcoin rally. What are the important support levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and the major altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin turned down from the resistance line and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($85,765) on March 28. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears will try to pull the price below the immediate support at $83,000. If they do that, the BTC/USDT pair could slide to $81,000 and later to $80,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $76,606 and $80,000. The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the resistance line to signal that the correction may be ending. A close above the 50-day simple moving average ($89,346) could propel the pair to $95,000 and eventually to the psychological resistance at $100,000. Ether price analysis Ether ( ETH ) turned down from the breakdown level of $2,111 and broke below the 20-day EMA ($2,032), indicating that the bears remain in control. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers will try to sink the ETH/USDT pair to the $1,800 to $1,754 support zone. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the zone because a break below it could resume the downtrend. The next stop on the downside could be $1,550. Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above $2,111 to signal that the bearish momentum is weakening. The 50-day SMA ($2,293) may act as a hurdle on the upside, but if taken out, the pair could rally to $2,550. XRP price analysis XRP ( XRP ) turned down and broke below the moving averages on March 26, indicating that the bears remain sellers on every minor rise. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears will try to sink the price to the vital support at $2. Buyers are expected to defend the level with all their might because a break below $2 will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. The XRP/USDT pair may then plunge to $1.27. On the contrary, a strong bounce off the $2 support could keep the pair stuck inside the triangle for a while longer. The bulls will be back in the driver’s seat on a break and close above the resistance line. BNB price analysis BNB ( BNB ) has been trading between the moving averages and the $644 resistance for the past few days. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($618) and the RSI in the positive territory signal a slight advantage to buyers. If the price rebounds off the moving averages with strength, it improves the prospects of a break above $644. The BNB/USDT pair could then surge to $686. Contrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below the moving averages, it indicates that the bulls have given up. The pair may descend to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $591. Solana price analysis Solana ( SOL ) broke below the 20-day EMA ($136) on March 28, suggesting a lack of demand from the bulls. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers will try to sink the price to the $120 to $110 support zone. Buyers are expected to defend the support zone aggressively because a break and close below it could resume the downtrend toward $80. The 50-day SMA ($153) is the critical overhead resistance to watch out for. Buyers will have to kick the price above the 50-day SMA to indicate that the SOL/USDT pair may have formed a floor at $110. The pair could then jump to $180. Dogecoin price analysis Dogecoin ( DOGE ) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($0.21) on March 26, indicating that the sentiment remains negative. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.18) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the near term. The DOGE/USDT pair could swing between $0.14 and the 50-day SMA for some time. If the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 50-day SMA, it will signal that the bulls are trying to form a higher low. That increases the possibility of a break above the 50-day SMA. The pair may ascend to $0.24 and later to $0.29. Cardano price analysis Cardano’s ( ADA ) failure to sustain above the 50-day SMA ($0.75) may have attracted profit booking by short-term buyers. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The ADA/USDT pair could slip to the uptrend line, where the buyers are expected to step in. If the price rebounds off the uptrend line, the bulls will again attempt to drive the pair above the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the pair may rise to $0.84 and then to $1.02. Contrarily, a break and close below the uptrend line suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may drop to the $0.58 to $0.50 support zone, which is likely to attract buyers. Related: XRP price may drop another 40% as Trump tariffs spook risk traders Toncoin price analysis Toncoin ( TON ) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($3.54) on March 26 and reached the overhead resistance of $4.14 on March 27. TON/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate advantage to buyers. If the price turns up from the current level or the 20-day EMA, it increases the likelihood of a break above $4.14. That opens the doors for a rise to $5. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below the moving averages. There is minor support at $3.32, but if the level cracks, the TON/USDT pair could slide to $2.81. Chainlink price analysis Chainlink ( LINK ) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($15.96) on March 28 and broke below the 20-day EMA ($14.76), indicating that bears are selling on rallies. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the LINK/USDT pair toward the support line. A break and close below the support line could sink the pair to $10. Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to quickly arrest the decline and push the price above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could climb to $17.70 and subsequently to the resistance line. Avalanche price analysis Avalanche ( AVAX ) failed to sustain above the 50-day SMA ($21.93), signaling that the bears are active at higher levels. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($20.51) is the critical support to watch out for. If the price closes below the 20-day EMA, the AVAX/USDT pair could skid to $18. Buyers are expected to defend the $18 level, but if the bears prevail, the pair could retest the critical support at $15.27. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 50-day SMA. That suggests solid buying at lower levels. The pair may then attempt a rally to the $25.12 to $27.23 overhead resistance zone. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Speaking during a March 28 episode of Cointelegraph's Chain Reaction show on X, the Polygon founder said that he has only seen this type of pressure and anti-L2 rhetoric during the current market cycle amid suppressed price action for Ether ( ETH ). “Everybody understands that if Ethereum doesn’t survive, the layer-2s won’t survive,” Nailwal said, adding: ""The Ethereum community should not pressure the developers enough — I should not be able to pressure the developers enough — for price movements and all that, they may end up making a decision that completely breaks the social fabric of Ethereum."" The Polygon co-founder praised Vitalik Buterin’s leadership and his more active role in the Ethereum Foundation , saying he has been the biggest force in keeping Ethereum's ecosystem cohesive. Nailwal characterized Buterin as the “DNA"" of the network that has attracted many talented developers over the years who are building layers on top of the Ethereum base layer. The total value secured across Ethereum’s scaling solutions. Source: L2Beat Related: Getting crypto out of the ‘AOL era’ — Sandeep Nailwal Settlement layers vs execution layers According to Nailwal, the layer-1 vs layer-2 dichotomy is the wrong way to think about blockchain networks. The Polygon founder defined only two settlement layers in all of crypto, Bitcoin and Ethereum, with all other crypto networks being execution layers. In the future, almost every application will have its own blockchain to avoid paying gas fees and will post final transactions to one of these settlement layers, Nailwal said. Ethereum's base layer will benefit from this explosion of execution layers, accruing value from these final settlements and promoting the long-term growth of the ecosystem, which will one day be seamlessly interoperable. Ethereum base layer fees drop following the Dencun upgrade. Source: The Tie Terminal Critics of Ethereum's execution layers say that the scaling networks are currently cannibalizing the base layer, which culminated in a 99% drop in Ethereum L1 revenue by September 2024. Nailwal concluded that due to these differences between settlement and execution layers, no other crypto network is real competition for Ethereum except the Bitcoin network. However, the only way the Bitcoin network could be a threat to Ethereum is if it adopted more advanced scripting options that give it reliable, smart contract functionality like Ethereum, Nailwal said.

Kiyosaki tells his 2.7 million followers on the social media platform X that silver, gold and Bitcoin are a hedge against rising inflation and economic uncertainty but that silver will likely outperform the other two assets in the near term. “As the prices of gold, silver and Bitcoin go up, the purchasing power of those who work for and save fake money get poorer via government theft known as ‘inflation.’ I want you to grow richer, not poorer. Please start working for and saving gold, silver and Bitcoin. Silver for the next two months is the best of the three: gold, silver and Bitcoin. Today silver is about $35 an ounce. I believe silver may soon be $70 an ounce this year and $200 in a year or two.” He also says that a global economic slowdown is taking shape. “The facts are the world is in a recession. The facts are inflation is going up and so is unemployment.” In January, Kiyosaki said he was unloading his gold and silver holdings to accumulate more BTC. At the time, the author predicted that Bitcoin would soar past $200,000 this year and that investors would likely be rewarded with generational wealth. “I’m switching as fast as I can out of gold and silver into Bitcoin. Because I think Bitcoin, in 2025, it will probably go to $250,000 a coin.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,021 at time of writing, down 3.5% in the last 24 hours.

Among them, Pi Network and Ozak AI have both captured the attention of traders. However, their paths, technology, and ability returns are massively distinctive. While Pi Network stays a work in development, Ozak AI is already making waves with its AI-driven ecosystem and astonishing 33,233% growth potential. 1. Pi Network’s Never-Ending Launch vs. Ozak AI’s Immediate Utility Pi Network has been in development for years, yet users are nevertheless expecting a totally operational mainnet. Its mining technique is simple, requiring users to tap a button every day, but the coin stays largely untradeable. On the other hand, Ozak AI has already entered the market with a functional environment powered by using AI-driven data analytics, offering real-world applications from the beginning. 2. Centralized Concerns in Pi Network vs. Ozak AI’s Decentralized Power Critics argue that Pi Network operates with a relatively centralized structure, leaving questions on true decentralization and user management. Ozak AI, however, integrates decentralized bodily infrastructure networks (DePIN) to enhance security and maintain transparency, making sure that users and developers have extra autonomy in its atmosphere. 3.

In an order signed by Judge Ana C. Reyes, the Court sided with Coinbase, asking the regulator to comply with an already established deadline. Latest Coinbase Victory Over US SEC According to the X update from Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal, Judge Ana denied the regulator’s demand to dismiss the FOIA case. The Judge also refused to grant a further extension in the timeline required to respond to the FOIA requests. According to an excerpt of the judgment, the Court noted that it had granted a series of leniencies regarding this case. These allowances include the 3-week extension granted in January this year. The Judge flagged the subtle strategy of the US SEC as it produced only eight documents when it finally complied with some of the court orders. To address this, Judge Reyes said it might resort to sanctions if the regulator fails to meet the next deadline set for April 11. As Paul Grewal noted, the Coinbase team has been meeting with the new SEC leadership. He noted that the public will soon gain insight into the regulators’ crackdown efforts. What is Coinbase Exchange Really After? Per an earlier CoinGape report, Coinbase filed to access information on the agency’s crypto crackdown efforts during Gary Gensler’s tenure. The crypto exchange was looking for key documents targeting Ethereum following its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS). Considering the contentions around Ethereum’s classification as a commodity while other assets were targeted, the exchange sought communications regarding this. The crypto exchange also sought to see the documents from the regulatory efforts directed to the Ethereum 2.0 investigation, as well as information on how much the SEC spent on its crypto litigation, the number of staff hours, and related details. With the FOIA demands, the trading platform pushes for transparency and accountability with the regulator. The US SEC Regulatory Shift While the Mark Uyeda-led commission is bearing the brunt of the Gary Gensler crackdowns in the industry. Since his temporary appointment as Chairman on January 20, Uyeda has changed the direction of the markets regulator. The SEC is now exploring industry collaboration rather than an enforcement strategy. As a show of goodwill, the commission has closed its case against the exchange and other firms operating in the crypto industry. Whether or not this positive pivot from the commission will sway Coinbase in the FOIA case remains unknown.

Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to a low of $1,880, its lowest level since March 18. It has now erased most of the gains made in the past two weeks. Ether crashed after the US released hot inflation data, pointing to higher interest rates for longer. The core Personal Consumption Expenditure Index rose from 2.7% in January to 2.8% in February. The headline PCE rose to 2.5%, higher than the Federal Reserve target of 2.0%. These numbers mean that inflation will remain stickier for a while, especially after Donald Trump implements his Liberation Day tariffs . Higher inflation means the Federal Reserve may hold higher interest rates for longer. This explains why other risky assets dropped after the PCE report. The S&P 500 index dropped by 1.50%, while the Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones crashed by 2% and 1.2%, respectively. Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Cardano ( ADA ) also crashed.

Economists caution that these tariffs may lead to a recession, erasing some of the growth that happened under Joe Biden. Further, Wall Street investors stay on the sidelines as Ethereum challenges remain. SoSoValue data show that spot Ethereum ETFs had inflows just once in March. They added $14.8 million in net assets on March 4, and have shed assets since then, bringing the cumulative assets to just $2.4 billion. All Ethereum ETFs have just $6.86 billion in assets. Ethereum ETF inflows and outflows | Source: SoSoValue Further, Ethereum has continued to lose market share in key industries like decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized exchanges. It has lost share to layer-1 chains like Sonic and Berachain, and layer-2 networks like Base and Arbitrum. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news ETH price has also crashed for technical reasons. The weekly chart shows that it formed a triple-top pattern at $4,000 and a neckline at $2,130, its lowest level in August last year. Ethereum dropped below this neckline earlier this month, and then retested it this month. A break-and-retest pattern is a popular continuation sign. It has also formed a bearish flag pattern, comprising a vertical line and some consolidation. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin will crash to $1,537, its lowest point on October 9. A move above the resistance level at $2,131 will invalidate the bearish view.

Solana ( SOL )-based MonkeDAO announced on March 28 that it had adopted a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve in its strategy by acquiring the APOLLO on Solana token zBTC. The newly-launched zBTC is a token pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin and native to Solana . MonkeDAO is the first DAO to adopt the token for its treasury reserve. According to the APOLLO team, the token offers BTC on-chain – not bridged or wrapped but permissionless. Holders can tap into this token to participate in decentralized finance on Solana, earning on-chain yield. You might also like: APOLLO debuts as Solana’s first trustless Bitcoin exchange via Zeus Network MonkeDAO says it’s adding this zBTC to its treasury. The 1 zBTC purchased goes into the Strategic Monke Reserve. SMR is the NFT DAO project’s treasury reserve strategy that will help the community foster financial sustainability. It’s also MonkeDAO’s commitment to a permissionless ecosystem for Bitcoin DeFi, or BTCFi. zBTC allows Bitcoin holders the opportunity to participate in DeFi on Solana via lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities. “The SMR is our commitment to long term growth and the addition of zBTC diversifies [and] strengthens our current pool of native assets,” MonkeDAO posted on X. This strategy is nonetheless not the Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, level of play, but it does illustrate the growing confidence in Bitcoin. As well as the 1:1 peg with Bitcoin, APOLLO says zBTC leverages the trustless two-way peg for security, which it actually achieves via a simple payment verification sidechain. The token also taps into a decentralized validator set on the Zeus Network. For its role in BTCFi, Apollo and Zeus Network target the “trillions in value” on the Bitcoin network. Opening up BTC from its underutilized liquidity, with hodlers’ coins idle in wallets, is a big opportunity for growth and use case strengthening. Zeus Network validated its first Bitcoin transaction on Solana in December 2024.

ExoraPad’s $EXP token presale has rocketed past its initial softcap, raising over 40,000 XRP and counting. The momentum shows no signs of slowing, as whales keep accumulating $EXP tokens, triggering intense FOMO among investors eager to capitalize on XRP’s next 100X gem. Join Exorapad Presale ExoraPad’s Explosive Presale Momentum Amid a backdrop of market uncertainties and price corrections, ExoraPad’s presale stands out as a beacon of optimism and opportunity within the XRP community. While the broader crypto market experiences turbulence, Bitcoin dropping from $87,000 to around $85,000 and XRP slipping from $2.5 to $2.2, the ExoraPad Presale is defying market gravity, clearly demonstrating investors’ confidence in its innovative approach. This extraordinary performance, attracting both XRP enthusiasts and savvy investorrs, underscores ExoraPad’s potential to be the next 100X altcoin sensation within the XRP ecosystem. What Makes ExoraPad Stand Out? ExoraPad is pioneering a new wave of innovation by integrating advanced artificial intelligence into blockchain fundraising. Unlike conventional IDO platforms, ExoraPad meticulously evaluates projects through AI-driven analytics, predictive modeling, and robust risk assessment, significantly reducing investment risks. The result? Only the highest quality Real-World Asset (RWA) projects and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) gain access to the platform, ensuring premium opportunities for investors. Buy $EXP Token Presale Investors Rush to Secure $EXP Tokens ExoraPad’s $EXP token isn’t just another crypto asset, it’s the lifeline of the ExoraPad ecosystem.

Furthermore, holding $EXP provides exclusive benefits, including early priority access to RWAs, DePIN and top tier innovative projects launching on the XRP ledger. More token utility includes, generous staking rewards upto 30% APY, DAO governance and revenue sharing from platform fees. These compelling incentives have intensified investor urgency and FOMO. How to Join the ExoraPad Presale Now With the softcap smashed and the presale rapidly approaching full completion, the opportunity to secure $EXP tokens at presale prices is narrowing fast. Here’s how to quickly participate: Purchase XRP through trusted exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Bybit). Transfer XRP to a compatible wallet (e.g., Xaman or Trust Wallet). Visit the official ExoraPad presale page ( https://exorapad.com/presale/ ) and send your XRP to the presale address. Upon the completion of the Presale, your $EXP Token allocation will be airdropped to your wallet. With the presale closing in on its final target, now is the perfect moment to position yourself for potentially massive gains as ExoraPad transforms the XRP ecosystem.

Just when you thought Bitcoin and Ethereum were hogging all the ETF limelight, the altcoin market is stepping up in a big way. Get ready for a potential shake-up as two industry giants, Grayscale and VanEck, have thrown their hats in the ring to launch an Avalanche ETF. This move signals a significant expansion in the crypto investment landscape, opening doors for broader market access to altcoins like Avalanche (AVAX). Why the Sudden Rush for an Avalanche ETF? The surge in filings for an Avalanche ETF reflects a growing appetite for diversified crypto investments. For years, Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated institutional and retail interest. However, the impressive growth and technological advancements within the altcoin ecosystem are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Avalanche, currently ranked 15th by market capitalization, stands out due to its speed, scalability, and vibrant ecosystem. The move by Grayscale and VanEck indicates a strong belief in Avalanche’s long-term potential and investor demand for exposure to AVAX ETF products. Nate Geraci, CEO of the ETF Store, brought this development to light through a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that Nasdaq has filed a crucial 19b-4 form to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Avalanche ETF. Shortly after, news broke that VanEck has also submitted their filing, setting the stage for a competitive race to launch the first Avalanche ETF . This dual filing underscores the robust interest in providing investors with regulated and accessible investment vehicles for altcoins. What Does This Mean for the Altcoin ETF Landscape? The filings for an Avalanche ETF are not happening in isolation. They are part of a broader trend of increasing interest in altcoin ETF products. Avalanche joins a rapidly expanding list of altcoins that have seen ETF filings, including: XRP Solana (SOL) Dogecoin (DOGE) Cardano (ADA) Sui (SUI) Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Polkadot (DOT) Litecoin (LTC) Aptos (APT) Axelar (AXL) This growing list signifies a significant shift in the regulatory and investment landscape. It suggests that regulators are becoming more comfortable with cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, and that institutional players are recognizing the demand for diversified crypto exposure. The potential approval of these altcoin ETFs could unlock billions of dollars in institutional and retail investment, further legitimizing the crypto market and driving adoption. Benefits of an Avalanche ETF: Why Should Investors Care? An Avalanche ETF offers several compelling benefits for investors, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio: Simplified Market Access: ETFs provide a straightforward way to invest in Avalanche without the complexities of directly purchasing and managing AVAX tokens. Investors can gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. Regulation and Security: ETFs are regulated investment products, offering a layer of security and investor protection that is often lacking in the direct crypto market. Custody and security concerns are handled by established financial institutions. Diversification: An Avalanche ETF allows investors to diversify their crypto holdings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially enhancing portfolio returns and reducing risk. Tax Efficiency: Depending on the jurisdiction, ETFs can offer certain tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption: The availability of an Avalanche ETF can pave the way for increased institutional investment in AVAX, as many institutions are restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies but can invest in ETFs. Challenges and Considerations for Avalanche ETFs While the prospect of an Avalanche ETF is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: ETF approvals are not guaranteed and are subject to regulatory review and potential delays. The SEC in the United States, for example, has historically been cautious about crypto ETFs. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. An Avalanche ETF , while offering diversification, will still be subject to the price fluctuations of AVAX and the broader crypto market. Management Fees: ETFs typically charge management fees, which can impact overall returns. Investors should consider these fees when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of an Avalanche ETF . Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance may not perfectly mirror the price movements of AVAX due to factors like trading costs and tracking error. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? The news of Grayscale and VanEck filing for an Avalanche ETF presents several actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts and investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the regulatory developments regarding these ETF filings. Track news from reputable sources like the ETF Store, Bloomberg, and CoinDesk. Research Avalanche (AVAX): If you’re unfamiliar with Avalanche, now is a good time to research its technology, ecosystem, and potential. Understand the fundamentals driving interest in AVAX. Consider Portfolio Diversification: Evaluate your crypto portfolio and consider how an Avalanche ETF , if approved, could fit into your diversification strategy. Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek advice from a qualified financial advisor to understand the implications of investing in crypto ETFs and whether they align with your financial situation. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Altcoin Investments The filings by Grayscale and VanEck for an Avalanche ETF represent a **monumental** leap forward for the altcoin market and crypto investment landscape. As the demand for diversified crypto exposure grows, and regulatory attitudes evolve, we are likely to see even more altcoin ETFs emerge. The potential approval of an Avalanche ETF could be a watershed moment, paving the way for wider adoption and legitimization of altcoins as a mainstream asset class. Keep your eyes peeled – the race for the first Avalanche ETF is officially on, and the implications for the crypto market are significant.

The achievement highlights the platform’s rapid growth in a sector that’s increasingly drawing both institutional and retail interest. The surge in performance, according to internal data and third-party analytics, is linked to a successful Q1 strategy that included high-impact marketing campaigns and new product rollouts, in collaboration with notable crypto partners such as SignalPlus, DWF, and Big Candle Capital. Crypto Options: From Niche Strategy to Core Market Structure Once reserved for quants and hedge funds, options are now becoming a go-to instrument for crypto-native investors. These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell assets at a set price — enabling sophisticated hedging, volatility plays, and directional speculation. As the broader digital asset market matures, crypto options are increasingly viewed as a critical building block of the financial stack. That narrative hit the mainstream this month when reports emerged of Coinbase being in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the market’s dominant BTC and ETH options venue, for a rumored $4–5 billion. Although negotiations have since tapered, the message from the market is clear: crypto derivatives are no longer a sideshow — they’re center stage. Youngest in the Top 5 — and Fastest Rising Coincall’s breakout is notable not just for its velocity, but for the company’s relative youth. Founded in late 2023, Coincall now ranks among the top exchanges in the space, with it currently 9-10% the size of Deribit. According to data from Laevitas, Coincall captured an average market share of 5.43% between March 8 and 17, 2025, with a notable peak at 10.15% on March 15. The exchange also saw strong volume days with 9.78% share on March 8 and 6.64% on March 16 — signaling rising momentum and growing competitiveness in the global crypto options landscape. Coincall’s comparative market share and growth trajectory make it the youngest exchange ever to break into the Top 5, and potentially one of the most viable candidates for acquisition or institutional partnership among rising players. As attention shifts from mature giants to agile challengers, Coincall has positioned itself at the center of that conversation, growing into almost the same market share as industry giant ByBit. Leadership Backed by Vision In January, Coincall appointed Daryl Teo — former strategist at Alibaba Group (NASDAQ: BABA) and a long-time investor in the crypto space — as Chief Operating Officer and minority shareholder. He joins CEO Jimmy's team of executives previously from OKX, Paradigm and Bytedance. “We’re witnessing crypto achieve consensus-level legitimacy as a store of value,” Teo said. “Options are the next wave — they provide leverage, flexibility, and strategy. Our mission at Coincall is simple: make investing quick, intuitive, and safe — for everyone.” ""Earn While You Trade"" feature: Unlocking Yield + Capital Efficiency Coincall’s latest innovation, Earn While You Trade (EWYT), is designed to eliminate the traditional tradeoff between yield farming and active trading. With EWYT, users can: Earn up to 6.4% APR on USDT holdings Access 90% of staked funds as trading margin Withdraw funds at any time — no lock-ups Increased capital efficiency for active traders The feature enables users to earn yield on idle capital without forgoing trading activity, offering an alternative approach to capital utilization. Users can explore the product here . Macro Momentum: Crypto Infrastructure Is Back Coincall’s rise reflects broader tailwinds in crypto infrastructure. According to PitchBook , $11.5 billion in venture capital was invested into crypto and blockchain startups in 2024 across 2,153 deals — a strong rebound after the prior bear cycle. “The next phase of crypto will be defined by real infrastructure,” said Teo. “The platforms building with intention, with capital efficiency and user accessibility in mind, will shape the decade ahead.” About Coincall Coincall is a next-generation cryptocurrency options exchange founded in 2023, focused on accessibility, capital efficiency, and a seamless trading experience. With deep liquidity, fast execution, and innovative features like Earn While You Trade, Coincall is building the future of digital asset derivatives.

The surge in performance, according to internal data and third-party analytics, is linked to a successful Q1 strategy that included high-impact marketing campaigns and new product rollouts, in collaboration with notable crypto partners such as SignalPlus, DWF and Big Candle Capital. Crypto options – From niche strategy to core market structure Once reserved for quants and hedge funds, options are now becoming a go-to instrument for crypto-native investors. These contracts give traders the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell assets at a set price – enabling sophisticated hedging, volatility plays and directional speculation. As the broader digital asset market matures, crypto options are increasingly viewed as a critical building block of the financial stack. That narrative hit the mainstream this month when reports emerged of Coinbase being in advanced talks to acquire Deribit – the market’s dominant BTC and ETH options venue – for a rumored $4-5 billion. Although negotiations have since tapered, the message from the market is clear – crypto derivatives are no longer a sideshow – they’re center stage. Youngest in the top five – and fastest rising Coincall’s breakout is notable not just for its velocity – but for the company’s relative youth. Founded in late 2023, Coincall now ranks among the top exchanges in the space, with it currently 9-10% the size of Deribit. According to data from Laevitas, Coincall captured an average market share of 5.43% between March 8-17, 2025, with a notable peak at 10.15% on March 15. The exchange also saw strong volume days with 9.78% share on March 8 and 6.64% on March 16 – signaling rising momentum and growing competitiveness in the global crypto options landscape. Coincall’s comparative market share and growth trajectory make it the youngest exchange ever to break into the top five, and potentially one of the most viable candidates for acquisition or institutional partnership among rising players. As attention shifts from mature giants to agile challengers, Coincall has positioned itself at the center of that conversation, growing into almost the same market share as industry giant ByBit. Leadership backed by vision In January 2025, Coincall appointed Daryl Teo – former strategist at Alibaba Group (NASDAQ: BABA) and a long-time investor in the crypto space – as chief operating officer and minority shareholder. He joins CEO Jimmy’s team of executives previously from OKX, Paradigm and Bytedance. Teo said, “We’re witnessing crypto achieve consensus-level legitimacy as a store of value. Options are the next wave – they provide leverage, flexibility and strategy. “Our mission at Coincall is simple – make investing quick, intuitive and safe – for everyone.” ‘Earn while you trade’ feature – Unlocking yield and capital efficiency Coincall’s latest innovation, EWYT (earn while you trade), is designed to eliminate the traditional tradeoff between yield farming and active trading. With EWYT, users can do the following. Earn up to 6.4% APR on USDT holdings Access 90% of staked funds as trading margin Withdraw funds at any time – no lock-ups Increased capital efficiency for active traders The feature enables users to earn yield on idle capital without forgoing trading activity, offering an alternative approach to capital utilization. Users can explore the product here . Macro momentum – Crypto infrastructure is back Coincall’s rise reflects broader tailwinds in crypto infrastructure. According to PitchBook , $11.5 billion in venture capital was invested into crypto and blockchain startups in 2024 across 2,153 deals – a strong rebound after the prior bear cycle. Teo said, “The next phase of crypto will be defined by real infrastructure. The platforms building with intention – with capital efficiency and user accessibility in mind – will shape the decade ahead.” About Coincall Coincall is a next-generation cryptocurrency options exchange founded in 2023, focused on accessibility, capital efficiency and a seamless trading experience.

According to a March 28 CNBC report, Trump granted pardons to Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, who were facing a range of criminal charges related to money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Hayes and Delo pleaded guilty in February 2022 , admitting they “willfully fail[ed] to establish, implement and maintain an Anti-Money Laundering program” at BitMEX, while Reed entered a plea a few weeks later. At the time of publication, the White House had not released a statement suggesting that Trump planned to pardon the three men. Cointelegraph contacted BitMEX for a comment regarding the pardon, but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has issued a number of controversial federal pardons , including to more than 1,500 people facing charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol and Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who was in prison for more than 11 years. Reports have suggested that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in misusing customer funds, was also attempting to cozy up to Trump and Republicans for a potential pardon. Related: Changpeng Zhao says he ‘wouldn’t mind a pardon’ from Donald Trump US authorities charged Delo, Reed, Hayes, and Gregory Dwyer — the exchange’s first employee — in 2020 with violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Hayes, BitMEX’s then-CEO, stepped down from his role amid the legal battle. The reasons for Trump’s pardon were unclear at the time of publication, as the three men had already been sentenced to a combination of home arrest or probation in 2022. The BitMEX co-founders were also ordered to pay $30 million in penalties as part of a civil case with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The exchange’s cases with US authorities included an agreement to pay $100 million in consent payments to both the CFTC and the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Center in 2021. In January, a judge imposed a $100 million fine and two years of unsupervised probation on HDR Global Trading Limited, BitMEX’s parent company.

However, a rising competitor priced at just $0.025 is now capturing investor attention with bold projections of a 13,320% rally. This emerging altcoin aims to mirror, if not surpass, Cardano’s (ADA) past success by offering cutting-edge blockchain solutions and faster adoption. During the current Phase 4 of the presale period, Mutuum Finance tokens sell for $0.025 per token. The strong investor support is visible through the $5.7 million raised from more than 7400 buyers who invested uniquely. The Phase 4 investors in MUTM can earn up to 140% return at $0.06. Mutuum Finance could hit $8 with the projected 13320% after launch. Cardano’s resilience in a competitive market The cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) maintains its endurance on the market because of its strong fundamentals and skilled development team while trading for $0.71. The continued investor trust in ADA remains robust because it focuses on top priorities of scalability and security alongside actual adoption in real-world environments even though emerging altcoins claim explosive growth potential. Despite short-term attractive benefits from new projects Cardano exists as a leading blockchain entity through its balanced long-term development strategy. ADA’s ability to transform and innovate will decide its future market position because the competition is growing stronger. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum as phase 4 takes off Hot investor activity keeps driving the popularity of Mutuum Finance despite the falling Shiba Inu values. The pre-sale activities of the project reached a milestone where investors contributed more than $5.7 million while acquiring more than 7400 participants. The MUTM token transitioned into Phase 4 while its price rose to $0.025 and will continue to advance until reaching the price of $0.06 at launch. Revolutionizing DeFi lending with a dual-lending system Through its dual-lending model Mutuum Finance revolutionizes decentralized loans by satisfying the lending requirements of both borrowers and lenders. Through Peer-to-Contract (P2C) automated liquidity pools manage and change interest rates to maximize capital efficiency. The elimination of intermediaries through P2P enables users to establish direct loan terms which stands out as an excellent solution for managing world assets. The system includes automated security for transparent transactions and provides users the option to select from fixed and variable interest rates. The platform achieves trust by undergoing independent audits and providing open-source smart contracts which deliver complete transparency. The Mutuum Finance platform has been developed for enduring success with its buyback strategy and revenue sharing (staking rewards) features as part of sustainable economic models. The demand increase will lead to additional upcoming exchange listings that will boost accessibility and liquidity between users. $100,000 giveaway Mutuum Finance conducts a $100,000 giveaway that gives 10 lucky participants $10,000 in MUTM tokens each to thank its initial users. Organizational growth gets accelerated through the referral program when users introduce new investors to earn bonus rewards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly positioning itself as a strong alternative to established cryptocurrencies, driven by innovative DeFi solutions and a fast-growing community. With $5.7 million already raised and 7,400 investors securing early positions, the presale continues to gain traction. As Phase 4 fills up, now is the ideal time to invest before the next surge. With a projected 50x increase to $3 in 2025, early investors stand to gain significantly.

Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje revealed that incoming stablecoin regulation in the US contributes to the change of stance. Sonic Labs Makes U-Turn Over Algorithmic USD Stablecoin In mid-March, Sonic Labs disclosed plans for a yield-generating algorithmic stablecoin for its blockchain. However, new developments in the US regulatory landscape are forcing the company to ditch its algorithmic stablecoin ambitions. Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje confirmed the change in direction via an X post following the release of the full draft of the STABLE Act by Congress for clearer oversight. According to the text, lawmakers are pushing for a two-year moratorium on algorithmic stablecoin, souring Sonic Labs plans. Unlike mainstream stablecoins backed by fiat or other commodities, algorithmic stablecoins rely on smart contracts to maintain their peg. The 2022 implosion of Terra’s ecosystem following the de-pegging of its TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin stunned regulators. “We will no longer be releasing a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin,” said Cronje. In a light-hearted note, community members teased potential strategies for Sonic Labs to sidestep incoming stablecoin regulation. Apart from the loophole of launching the algorithmic stablecoin before the regulation goes live, Cronje teased an algorithmic dirham that will be denominated in USD. Industry Players Are Bracing For New Stablecoin Regulations Stablecoin issuers are steeling themselves for incoming stablecoin regulations in the US. While the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act continue to inch forward, there are common denominators in both bills. For starters, there is the requirement for equivalent reserves at a 1:1 ratio with both bills steering clear of algorithmic stablecoins. The White House is favoring the GENIUS Act over the STABLE Act as lobbyists rally to stifle the possibility of a Conference Committee. Authorities are targeting stablecoin regulation to reach Trump in two months as issuers jostle for position. Tether, Circle, and Ripple are staking their claims to lead the US government’s ambitions to rely on stablecoins to maintain the dollar’s dominance.

The altcoins saw sharp declines as Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $84k amid CME gap trades. Cryptocurrencies were also tracking downside action amid broader jitters across the risk assets market. Top crypto losers today As several altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP and Solana tapped further weakness, analysts pointed to what could happen next. The global crypto market cap stood at $2.72 trillion, down 4% in 24 hours, while total daily trading volume was up 16% to over $90 billion. In the crypto derivatives space, the market recorded a notable spike in liquidations. Data from Coinglass showing a 100% jump in 24 hours to over $448 million in wiped out longs and shorts. The fresh pain across the crypto market mirrored the reaction on Wall Street as macroeconomic data out on the day showed the United States’ higher inflation. A number of crypto tokens bled significantly, to contribute to the 5% dip in the global crypto market cap. Curve DAO (CRV) was down more than 14% to below $0.50, while Bonk (BONK) and Sonic (S) were each down 12%. Bonk’s dip follows a notable surge earlier in the day amid positive ecosystem news . The other top losers on the day included Pyth Network (PYTH), down 10%; Lido DAO -10% and Bittensor (TAO) also -10% in the past 24 hours. The top altcoins of SOL, XRP, BNB and ADA also dropped, with these recording between 2% and 6%. What are analysts saying? Mike Alfred, a crypto investor and entrepreneur says : “With Bitcoin and other high quality long term assets, it’s always better to add a little early than it is to add very late.” Another analyst, Michael van de Poppe, is bullish on Sonic (S).

The current market trend suggests a period of consolidation, with BTC attempting to find support after failing to break key resistance levels. Daily Timeframe Analysis On the daily chart, Bitcoin is consolidating near $84,000, struggling to sustain upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates indecisiveness, suggesting that traders are waiting for a clearer direction. Key support sits at $82,000–$83,000, which could be tested soon if selling pressure persists. Weekly Timeframe Analysis Bitcoin recently hit a high of $88,752 on March 24 but has since been forming lower highs and lower lows, signaling a downward trend. The failure to break the $88,000 resistance increases the likelihood of further retracement. If BTC remains below this level, it could see a correction toward $80,000 or even $75,000 in the coming weeks. 4-Hour Timeframe Analysis The 4-hour chart shows BTC stabilizing near $87,000, with traders hesitant to push the price higher. If BTC fails to regain momentum above $85,000, it may trigger a larger sell-off. Short-term support sits at $82,500, and a break below this level could accelerate the decline. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Predicted Next Move Bitcoin’s next move depends on whether it can hold above key support levels: Bearish Scenario: If BTC loses support at $82,000, it could decline to $78,000–$75,000 before finding strong buying interest and if buyers fail to gain control, BTC price may drop to $70,000 if the downward momentum continues. Bullish Scenario: If BTC reclaims $85,000–$86,000, it may attempt another run toward $90,000–$93,700. However, this relief rally could be short-lived unless buying volume increases. BTC is currently in a high-risk zone , with a higher probability of short-term downside. Traders should monitor the $82,000–$83,000 support—if it holds, BTC could attempt recovery; if broken, expect a further drop toward $75,000.

The three had previously pleaded guilty to federal charges related to money laundering and regulatory violations, according to CNBC reporting . The three executives were convicted for failing to implement anti-money laundering measures at BitMEX, which prosecutors labeled a “money laundering platform.” Reed admitted to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in 2022 and agreed to pay a $10 million fine. Despite BitMEX’s claims of withdrawing from the U.S. market, authorities alleged that the move was a “sham.” You might also like: Solana-based MonkeDAO acquires zBTC as a Bitcoin reserve BitMEX’s banking hiccups In January, BitMEX was ordered to pay a $100 million penalty for violating U.S. banking laws.

BitMEX sought a buyer earlier this year and enlisted Broadhaven Capital Partners for the sale. Reports indicated the investment bank was appointed in late 2024 to facilitate the deal. The move followed increasing mergers and acquisitions in the crypto derivatives sector. Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, according to CNBC, the same day Trevor Milton, the former CEO of Nikola, announced that he had received clemency for his securities fraud conviction.

CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV), put forward by Jeremy Rubin with BIP 119, is the most mature and fully fleshed out covenant proposal, not only out of the proposals we will be covering, but out of all of the covenant proposals in their entirety. As I mentioned in the introduction article to this series, there are many concerns in the ecosystem regarding covenants that are too flexible enabling things that wind up having very detrimental consequences for Bitcoin. CTV was designed specifically to constrain its capabilities tightly enough to avoid any of those concerns. To first understand how CTV functions, we need to understand the individual parts of a Bitcoin transaction. This is a very high level view of a Bitcoin transaction. It has inputs, or unspent coins ( UTXOs ), and outputs, the new unspent coins that the transaction will create when it is confirmed in a block. There are a lot more pieces we will go through, but this is the highest level view of a transaction’s structure. Every transaction also has a version number field for the whole transaction, indicating applicability of new versions of rules or features. There is also the marker and the flag, which are set to specific values to indicate the transaction uses Segwit. After this is the input count, the number of inputs in the transaction. Then come the actual inputs. Each input contains a TXID of the transaction that created the unspent coin being spent, a VOUT which marks what output in that transaction is being spent, the size of the ScriptSig, and the ScriptSig, which is the unlocking script proving the input being spent is authorized by its locking script rules, and finally a Sequence number which is used to ensure the input being spent is following relative timelock rules. i.e. the input has existed for a certain number of blocks or length of time since its creation. The output count is the next piece of data, the number of outputs in the transaction. After this comes the actual outputs, which contain an amount of satoshis assigned to that output, the ScriptPubKey size, and the actual ScriptPubKey, which is the locking script for that output. Lastly the nLocktime field applies a timelock value in timestamp or block height that applies to the entire transaction. Each Segwit transaction also contains a Witness section, where each input has a corresponding witness containing a Stack Items count, how many things will be put on the script stack, a Size field for each item, and the actual data Item to go on the stack. How CTV Works CTV is an opcode that enables the most basic form of introspection and forward data carrying out of all the covenant proposals. It allows a script to take a pre-defined 32 byte hash and compare that against a hash of most of the fields of the spending transaction. If the hash derived from the actual spending transaction does not match the pre-defined hash, the transaction is invalid. The fields it commits to are: nVersion nLocktime Input count A hash of all the nSequence fields Output count A hash of all the outputs Input index (the place the input has in the transaction, 1st input, 2nd, etc.) These are all the fields committed to by the CTV hash, in their entirety, and with no ability to pick and choose. This is the degree of introspection CTV enables, “does the hash of these fields in the spending transaction match the hash in the locking script of the input being spent,” that’s it. The hash commits to essentially the entire transaction except the actual inputs. There is a reason the hash does not include the inputs. In order to lock an output to a 32 byte hash with CTV, you need to know the hash of the transaction that you are ensuring is the only way for it to be spent. The input locked with CTV being spent will have to include this hash in order to be verified against CTV. That necessitates having the hash of that transaction before you create the complete transaction. That is not possible. You can also nest CTV scripts, i.e. have an initial CTV script commit to a transaction with outputs that also include CTV scripts. This is what allows CTV to “carry forward” data. All it carries forward in practice though is whatever data is contained in the chain of transactions. You can do this in theory to an infinite depth, but you are limited in practice to a finite depth because the nesting must be generated backwards starting from the end. This is because each level, or “hop,” must have the hash of the transaction moving to the next one, otherwise you can’t create the locking script in the first place. If you don’t already know the next transaction, you can’t generate the previous one. What Is CTV Useful For CTV allows you to restrict an output so that it can only be spent, according to consensus rules, by an exact pre-defined transaction. Some of you might be asking what the big deal is, we can already pre-sign transactions. If the level of introspection is so limited that it can only accomplish something we can already do just pre-signing, what is the value add? First, pre-signed transactions always leave open the possibility of the keyholder(s) signing new transactions and spending those coins in a different way. You have to trust that the keyholder will not do this, or will delete the key needed to sign with (which you also have to trust them on). CTV removes that trust entirely. Once the spending transaction is defined and the output locked to that CTV hash is created, there is no possibility of being spent another way, enforced by consensus. Currently the only way around that trust is to be involved in pre-signing transactions yourself using multisig. Then you can be completely certain that unless you choose to sign one yourself, no other valid transaction spending a coin in a different way can be created. The problem is the more people are involved, the more difficult and unreliable coordinating everyone to pre-sign a transaction at the same time becomes. Past small sizes it becomes a totally impractical problem to solve reliably. CTV gives a way for people to know a set of transactions is committed without everyone having to get online at the same time to sign them. It greatly simplifies the coordination process by allowing everyone to get the needed information to anyone else whenever they can, and once that person has everyone’s information they can create the chain of CTV transactions without anyone else’s involvement, and everyone can verify and be certain that the correct outcome is the only possible one. That is incredibly valuable on its own, but CTV can also enable even more valuable things in combination with other opcodes, which we’ll see in the next article. Closing Thoughts CTV is a tightly restricted covenant that enables a degree of introspection and forward data carrying that is so limited it does not exceed the actual functionality of anything that can be done with pre-signed transactions. The value proposition is not in enabling new functionality in its own right, but drastically improving the efficiency, scalability, and security guarantees of what can be built currently using pre-signed transactions. This alone is a massive benefit to almost every currently deployed protocol using pre-signed transactions. Here are some of the projects demonstrating how thoroughly fleshed out and explored this particular covenant is compared to the others: A basic payment pool example by stutxo . A CTV vault implementation by James O’Beirne , who went on to propose OP_VAULT (which still makes use of CTV). A proof-of-concept port of the pre-signed transaction based Ark implementation from Second by Steven Roose to use CTV instead. The Sapio Language by Jeremy Rubin himself, a higher level language for building contracts with CTV (also supporting the use of pre-signed transactions instead). Timeout Trees , a proposal for a very basic coinpool design by John Law. Numerous other possible protocols , such as optimized Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), non-interactive Lightning channels one party could open without the other, and even decentralized ways for miners to pool together. CTV is an incredibly mature proposal at this point, with a high value add, and no risk of enabling anything driving the concerns around covenants. This should not only be very seriously considered, but in my personal opinion should have been activated years ago.

ADA joined the party and is now posting minor losses on the daily scale. The past three weeks’ trading has subjected ADA to a consolidation phase due to a serious contraction. But things are now getting heated up from the bears’ side following a notable loss in the last 24 hours. While the bearish party is likely to continue, more selling pressure can be expected with bigger losses in the coming days. Retaking the monthly low is a key target for the bears. If they do this week, we can expect a key breakdown capable of expanding bearishness in the coming month. If that occurs, ADA may plunge to as low as $0.37 – a key level where the price surged through during last November’s rally. A rebound should be expected once the price tests the mentioned low. Losing that month’s low would mark the start of a long-term bearish move. For now, there’s still hope for a bullish move, even in the face of the dip. If the bulls manage to defend the recent yearly low well, we can anticipate an increase capable of restoring bullish actions. That could trigger a rally to a new high. But looking at the latest setup from a technical perspective, the bears are expected to gain more control soon. ADA’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview In the latest fall, ADA is eyeing $0.65. A successful pull below this level could bring a retest at the $0.58 and $0.5 levels before plunging heavily to the mentioned low. While there’s no sign of bulls in the market at the moment, the higher resistance level to watch for buying would be $0.913 and $1.175, aside from the recent weekly high of $0.776.

Failure to break through may trigger a little consolidation before deciding the next move. Last month’s trading was painful as LTC witnessed a major crash after failing to push above $140. This brought a significant loss, and the trend swiftly switched from bullish to bearish within the blink of an eye. The most important part of the crash lies in the breakdown of the key $100 level that stood as crucial support for the past three months. Ending that month extremely weak, LTC saw a relief this month and retraced for three weeks. Things turned negative today due to a sudden decrease in the market cap, and the price dropped to $88. As seen on the daily chart, the bears appear back in action following an increase in the selling volume since yesterday. A continuous increase in volume could fuel more dips in the coming days. This could lead to a serious bloodbath next month if this week closes on a bearish note. While the current monthly low is a key sell target to watch for another crack, LTC may revisit the $70 level anytime soon. That should be expected when the supply level turns heavy. LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The key closest target support for the bears on the way down is $83.3 – the current monthly low. If they surpass it, their next target would be $77.9, along with the $74.3 level. Towards the upside, LTC recently marked resistance at $. If the price climbs back above it, the $ and $ levels are the next resistance to consider for an increase.

The SEC has decided not to press charges against Welch in connection with the rapid rise and subsequent collapse of the meme-based cryptocurrency. US SEC Investigation Into Hawk Tuah Girl Concludes Without Charges The SEC had launched an investigation into the $HAWK token after its dramatic price drop. The token, which was linked to Welch’s viral persona, initially saw a market cap surge to $490 million before crashing by over 90%. Investors who were impacted by the crash filed a lawsuit against those behind the project, alleging that the coin had been promoted and sold without proper registration. Hawk Tuah girl Hailey Welch, who cooperated fully with the investigation, expressed relief after the SEC’s decision. “For the past few months, I’ve been cooperating with all the authorities and attorneys, and finally, that work is complete,” Welch told TMZ.

After weeks of consolidation, this zone has emerged as a key battleground between bulls and bears, potentially defining the short-to-mid term trajectory of the token. Over the past two weeks, XRP has gained over 7%, showing clear signs of renewed strength. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are approaching bullish thresholds, and momentum indicators are pointing toward a possible breakout scenario. A clean move above $2.50 could unlock targets in the $3.00–$3.40 range, according to several analysts monitoring XRP’s multi-year breakout patterns. But what’s fueling this price action? Much of it stems from a dramatic shift in the regulatory environment. Legal Clarity Boosts XRP Outlook After SEC and Ripple Drop Appeals In a major development for the crypto industry, both the U.S. SEC and Ripple Labs have officially dropped their appeals in the long-standing XRP case—marking the end of one of crypto’s most public legal battles. Source: Good Morning Crypto This regulatory breakthrough removes a significant cloud that has hovered over XRP since 2020. With the legal uncertainty now behind it, institutional interest in XRP is expected to rise significantly. Just last week, XRP saw $6.7 million in inflows from institutional investors, an unusually high figure given the broader market’s flat performance. XRP’s status as a legally defined asset, combined with its central role in cross-border financial infrastructure, is drawing renewed attention from hedge funds, banks, and crypto-native investors alike. The market’s response is now converging on one key question: can XRP finally breakout and retest its all-time highs? Rotating Toward Early-Stage High-Growth Opportunities While XRP’s risk profile has improved dramatically thanks to legal clarity and technical strength, some investors are beginning to question whether its upside is capped. With a market cap already exceeding $140 billion, achieving another 100x return becomes increasingly unrealistic. This has sparked a broader shift among retail investors, who are now looking toward smaller, emerging projects, particularly those still in presale, that offer a stronger growth-to-risk ratio. Crypto market cycles have historically shown that after major caps like Bitcoin and XRP stabilize, capital tends to rotate into mid and low-cap assets. The next wave of breakout projects often comes from ecosystems that combine strong narratives, proven traction, and scalable user onboarding. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) – A New Model for Web3 Investing One of the most compelling early-stage projects gaining traction right now is The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) . Rather than offering yet another passive token utility or static staking model, TLD introduces an entirely new paradigm, Play-to-Invest, where users engage with an interactive game platform that unlocks access to presale tokens of other emerging crypto projects. The platform is already live on Telegram and fully integrated with the TON blockchain, giving TLD instant exposure to a potential user base of over 900 million. What’s more, over 300,000 users have already joined the ecosystem, interacting daily with its mining, staking, and progression systems. In TLD, players “mine” tokens not through traditional staking, but by leveling up characters and optimizing in-game strategies, creating an ecosystem where value generation is active, skill-based, and inherently more sustainable than inflationary P2E models. TLD Presale Gains Momentum Ahead of Stage 3 The $TLD presale is currently in Stage 2, with the first stage already completely sold out. Tokens are now priced at $0.00852, and early buyers can benefit from staking rewards of up to 300% APY, along with participation in the Ref2Earn program, which offers a 15% bonus for each successful referral. To further reward its early community, The Last Dwarfs has also launched a 1 Million $TLD Giveaway , giving users the chance to win free tokens simply by completing small tasks and inviting friends into the ecosystem. Final Thoughts – Could TLD Outperform XRP’s Growth Potential? There’s no doubt that XRP is on firmer ground today than it has been in years. Its legal clarity, growing institutional inflows, and strong technical setup suggest that it may finally be ready for its next rally. But with a multi-billion dollar market cap already in place, the days of 100x returns for XRP are likely behind us. In contrast, early-stage projects like The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) are just getting started. With a functioning platform, over 300,000 users, and a presale still underway, TLD combines innovation with real-world traction, reducing the typical risks of presale investing. If XRP manages to break $2.50, it will likely ignite broader interest in altcoins. But for those seeking outsized returns, TLD may offer the better bet, before the rest of the market catches on.

While other projects have stumbled, Coldware (COLD) continues building out a mobile-native infrastructure powered by Litenodes, a decentralized dApp Store, and built-in PayFi capabilities. This has attracted early interest from institutions and retail investors alike, particularly those looking to escape the stagnation of legacy mobile crypto platforms. The $COLD token powers the entire Coldware (COLD) ecosystem, enabling low-fee payments, dApp access, staking, and interaction with IoT-enabled devices like the Larna 2400® smartphone. Coldware’s unique approach isn’t just about speculation—it’s about solving real problems in decentralized finance and mobile usability. Coldware Becomes a Diversification Destination for PI Whales As momentum in Pi Network (PI) fades, whale investors are moving their capital toward Coldware (COLD) , seeing its potential to disrupt mobile crypto infrastructure. Coldware’s combination of lightweight mobile nodes, DePin utility, and on-device staking offers both performance and utility—something Pi Network (PI) has yet to fully deliver. With Coldware’s growing visibility in the Web3 space, especially across gaming, DeFi, and IoT sectors, it’s becoming the go-to choice for those seeking a modern, interoperable, and efficient mobile protocol. Pi Network (PI) holders diversifying into Coldware (COLD) aren’t just seeking profits—they’re chasing functionality and growth. How to Join the Coldware Ecosystem Joining Coldware’s ecosystem is straightforward. Early investors can participate in the ongoing presale by visiting the official Coldware (COLD) website, connecting their wallet, and selecting their preferred payment method. Once completed, the purchased $COLD tokens will be visible in the user dashboard and claimable before launch. What makes this appealing is the project’s long-term vision and real-world application. Unlike Pi Network (PI), which still struggles with centralized roadblocks, Coldware (COLD) is community-focused, infrastructure-ready, and designed for true decentralization across devices. PI Network (PI) Faces Centralization Concerns and Listing Doubts Pi Network (PI) launched its mainnet in February 2025, yet continues to face backlash over its lack of decentralization and uncertain exchange support. Most recently, rumors surfaced that Binance rejected listing Pi Coin due to its closed mainnet and centralized governance. Although Pi Network (PI) supporters argue that the mainnet is open, Binance has not issued any formal statement—leaving investors in limbo. This has caused considerable doubt within the Pi Network (PI) community, especially among large holders (whales) who had expected a post-mainnet listing to drive value. With the token currently priced at $0.84, up 3% in the last 24 hours but still down over 70% from February highs, the enthusiasm has clearly waned. The Shift Away From PI Network (PI) Pi Network (PI) once promised to revolutionize crypto through accessible mobile mining, but the lack of clarity surrounding its exchange listings, its centralized validator model, and its limited ecosystem utility have caused concern. While the .pi domain auctions sparked brief interest, they haven’t translated into long-term confidence. Coldware (COLD) is stepping in with a better offering—true mobile utility, a real dApp economy, and future-facing infrastructure that includes cross-chain interoperability and IoT integration. Pi Network (PI) may have ignited early excitement, but Coldware (COLD) is lighting the path forward. Conclusion As Pi Network (PI) struggles with its identity and direction post-mainnet, Coldware (COLD) is establishing itself as the superior alternative for mobile-native Web3 interaction. With whale investors now diversifying away from Pi Network (PI), and Coldware’s presale accelerating, the writing on the wall is clear: utility, decentralization, and mobile-first design win in the long run. Coldware (COLD) is not just a presale—it’s a movement toward a smarter, more connected blockchain future.

This reverses a controversial policy imposed under the Biden administration. In a March 28 statement, the FDIC said banks can now participate in crypto-related services like custody and trading if they properly manage the risks. The agency will also work to replace old regulations with updated crypto guidance. BREAKING: FDIC says banks can engage in crypto activities without prior approval. pic.twitter.com/H0eGXfvSna — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 28, 2025 The policy change came in a new Financial Institution Letter that rescinds earlier rules from 2022 requiring banks to get FDIC clearance before handling bitcoin and crypto assets. That red tape frustrated the banking industry. By removing this barrier, the FDIC enables its supervised banks to experiment with this emerging ecosystem more freely. However, specific permissions will still depend on interagency coordination. Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill called the move “one of several steps” in laying out a new crypto-friendly approach focused on security. He said, “The FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years.” The agency expects to release additional guidance as it consults the President’s Working Group on digital assets. Major banks have recently launched bitcoin and crypto services despite unclear regulations. Providing regulatory clarity will allow more banks to participate.

The visit, reported by Bloomberg, follows Bukele’s agreement to detain hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members deported from the U.S., a move that aligns with Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda. If finalized, Bukele will be the first leader from the Western Hemisphere to receive a formal White House visit under Trump’s administration. While no official date has been set, discussions are ongoing, and plans could change. Bukele has actively courted Trump in recent months, positioning himself as a key regional ally on security and migration. Bukele has drawn international attention for his strict crime policies , particularly his crackdown on gang violence, which has significantly reduced crime rates in El Salvador. His administration’s cooperation with U.S. deportation policies could further solidify his standing with Trump, who has made border security a top priority.

The move has drawn mixed reactions, with supporters praising it as financial innovation and critics pointing to volatility and IMF concerns . Bukele has remained a strong advocate for Bitcoin, using it to attract foreign investment and promote economic independence.

According to prominent, self-proclaimed market wizard Peter Brandt, a head-and-shoulders pattern has formed on the XRP daily chart. The formation hints at a potential drop in price value, and according to the analyst, XRP could drop to lower levels of $1.07 or $1.90 in the near term. A break below the $3 price level weakened the H&S model, and a continuous consolidation in price could result in a massive 55% drop in price value. “Updating a chart for those interested, I have no vested interest up or down. XRP is forming a textbook H&S pattern. So, we are now range-bound. Above 3.000 I would not want to be short. Below 1.9 I would not want to own it” he wrote in a post shared to X. Conversely, market analyst Javon Marks sees a more favorable outcome in the near term. According to his assertion, a trend reversal is in view, courtesy of XRP’s price and relative strength index (RSI) breaking through a descending wedge. “XRP’s Price and RSI has BROKEN OUT TO THE UPSIDE! The last breakout resulted in a roughly +570% price increase and prices can be ready for another substantial surge.” He asserted. XRP is trading for $2.17 at the time of this report.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin exhibits signs of a robust upward trend. This article delves into which meme coins are primed for a rally, offering insights into the potential growth trajectories of these digital assets. Pepe (PEPE): Short-Term Gains Behind Long-Term Setbacks PEPE prices show a modest gain over the past month while falling significantly in the half-year period. The weekly performance reflects an 11.21% climb, suggesting brief bullish activity. During this time, price levels have fluctuated within a narrow range. Overall, the data indicates uneven performance with sporadic moves interrupting a longer-term downturn. Current levels show the coin near resistance at $0.00001686, supported by a lower level at $0.00000277, and an additional resistance at $0.00002390. Earnings indicators and a slightly elevated RSI indicate cautious buyer interest. Active traders may look for positions on retracements while keeping an eye out for breakout opportunities between these key levels. DOGE Market Recap: Short-Term Dip, Strong Six-Month Recovery DOGE experienced a 14.18% weekly gain followed by an 8.74% decline last month while posting an impressive 50.35% surge over the past six months. The price history shows a mix of brief corrections and a strong upward trend in the long run with noticeable but temporary bearish moves. Current price oscillates between $0.14 and $0.30 with immediate resistance at $0.39 and support at $0.09, and an extra resistance point around $0.54. Overall market balance is indicated by an RSI near 52 and minimal oscillator momentum, inviting trades within these established levels as bulls and bears test the bounds without a clear trend. Conclusion PEPE has broken through resistance levels, suggesting strong upward momentum. DOGE 's super trend indicator points to continued strength in the market. These signs combined imply that a rally for meme coins might be forthcoming. The overall outlook for PEPE and DOGE remains positive, with further gains appearing likely in the near term.

In a new video update, deVere Group CEO Nigel Green tells his 115,000 YouTube subscribers that stablecoins, or fiat-pegged digital assets, could save the US economy and reinvigorate demand for the top two crypto assets by market cap. According to Green, stablecoins can help keep US interest rates lower, boosting money circulation in the economy. “Stablecoins are virtually instant – in other words, it means you can transfer inexpensively and very quickly. It’s good for banks, it’s good for individuals. Really, it’s a revolution.” The executive goes on to say that if the US can successfully create policies that boost dollar-pegged stablecoins, it would increase the rate at which people are buying US Treasury bills with fixed rates, which would drive down interest rates and increase demand for tech stocks, BTC and ETH. “It’s in America’s interest to try and drive down interest rates. [They are] pushing hard on producing stablecoins… Trump has his own family venture which is going to be launching stablecoins. JPMorgan, PayPal, you’ve got many many different [firms], including Fidelity, that are producing or have produced stablecoins. Okay, it’s the future. So then if we take that as the future, what else does it mean? Well, we live in a digital world already. So obviously there are some stocks that gain in the digital world. They’re fairly obvious – the ones that are in the tech industry will gain. If payments are faster, easier to be paid, then they gain. But also at the same time, not only does this create more innovation, it means that we’re in a world where people will buy more Bitcoin, use more Ethereum. In general, stablecoins [will] actually settle in Ethereum [and] drive the price up.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company recently allocated a portion of its cash reserves to the leading asset and plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings as its cash reserves grow. This move follows a growing trend among companies considering Bitcoin a valuable asset. More Companies Embrace Bitcoin for Long-Term Value Dominari Holdings is not the only company investing in Bitcoin . Big firms, including the software intelligence firm Strategy, KULR Technology Group, and Semler Scientific, have adopted a Bitcoin strategy. These private companies see the asset as a strong financial asset that has the potential to hedge against inflation. Last December, KULR announced that it would invest up to 90% of its extra cash into the leading cryptocurrency. The company recently bought $65 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $88,824 per coin, bringing its total holdings to 668.3 BTC. This strategy has been highly profitable, as KULR has reported an 181.1% return on its Bitcoin investment this year. Strategy, the Bitcoin treasury company led by Michael Saylor has total Bitcoin holdings of over 500,000 BTC worth more than $44 billion. Despite market uncertainty, this came after the company bought 6,911 BTC some days ago. Bitcoin Is Becoming a Bigger Part of Corporate Finance Strategy Bitcoin is no longer just an asset for retail investors or an alternative investment; it is becoming a major part of the financial system. Institutional investors are adopting Bitcoin as a valuable asset. The launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has made it easier for large investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without buying and storing it directly. Dominari Holdings has also invested $2 million into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), the largest digital investment product. As more businesses and financial institutions adopt Bitcoin, its role in corporate finance is expanding. The growing national Bitcoin reserve initiative suggests that the asset could play a much bigger role in corporate finance. Bitcoin Market Outlook According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is trading at $83,771 as of writing, down 4.08% in the last 24 hours. Notably, recent market fluctuations caused by economic factors and investor sentiment have led to uncertainty in the crypto market. While many analysts are being cautious, some market experts remain optimistic. Earlier this month, Jamie Coutts, Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst, revealed that Bitcoin is on track to break past its all-time high of $109,000 sooner than anticipated.

The recent downturn crashed crypto prices and left lingering effects on new holders. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price rose 2.7% in the past seven days to $87,526. Despite trading below the $100k mark, previous data might favor a turnaround with whale accumulations. STH Unrealized Losses at 4% A new CryptoQuant report shows that the short-term high remains negative following the downtrend in crypto prices. Short-term holders’ realized price is now at $90,800, down 4% compared with the market value to realized value ratio. This year, Bitcoin’s price nosedived from an all-time high above $108k to current levels. This loss of value has taken a toll on relatively new holders, weakening the broader sentiment. Bulls will face further resistance if present factors persist due to sell pressures. This period was categorized with inflows to centralized exchanges and an outflow reduction in miner reserves to hedge against losses. “ (Short term holders) continue to face unrealized losses of around 4%, meaning the STH MVRV ratio is currently at 0.96. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio is an indicator that compares total market capitalization with realized capitalization. Realized capitalization represents the average purchase price, and in this case, it refers specifically to STH (Coin held Since the last bull phase, short-term holders’ profit percentage failed to break 42%, ushering in a slight correction afterward. While this bear phase has consequences for market strength, a rebound could be in the cards. This typically occurs when the unrealized losses fluctuate between 9% and 17%. Whales Target $95k Recovery After the Bitcoin price slumped below the $80k mark, whales moved to buy the dip. Although institutional sentiments remained low, new movements triggered an upward trend. Last week, institutional investors reversed five weeks of losses, recording inflows of over $700 million. New Glassnode data shows that Bitcoin whales have accumulated $11 billion worth of assets in the last 14 days. The purchase of 129,000 BTC has also spiked retail interest in the market after months of low activity . However, analysts opine that a $95k target can be sustained with easing macro tensions alongside whale purchases.

All three had already pleaded guilty and were sentenced, but on Thursday, the White House confirmed the full pardons, just over three months after the exchange itself was fined $100 million for violating U.S. law. Arthur, the former CEO of BitMEX, had been sentenced to six months of home confinement followed by two years of probation. Benjamin, who served as chief operating officer and strategy officer, got 30 months of probation. Samuel, who was BitMEX’s chief technology officer, was handed 18 months of probation. Together, the three were fined $30 million in civil penalties. Prosecutors said the men operated BitMEX like a money laundering platform, and allowed U.S. users to continue trading on the exchange even after announcing BitMEX would stop serving them. That announcement, according to federal authorities, was “a sham.” The platform lacked any functioning KYC or AML system and completely ignored the Bank Secrecy Act, which mandates customer identity checks and suspicious activity monitoring. The trio had entered guilty pleas in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, admitting that they failed to establish or maintain proper controls. The court accepted the plea deals, which let them avoid prison time. Despite the non-custodial sentences, the Justice Department said their actions enabled years of unchecked financial activity that could have supported criminal transactions. Trump grants additional pardons to Milton and Ulbricht The BitMEX pardons were part of a larger set of actions taken by Trump this week. On Thursday night, Trevor Milton, the founder and former CEO of electric truck startup Nikola, confirmed that Trump also pardoned him. Trevor had been convicted of securities fraud and sentenced to four years in prison for misleading investors about Nikola’s tech. He hadn’t entered prison yet, as he was still appealing the case. Trump had pardoned a crypto figure before. On January 22, he announced that he had signed a full and unconditional pardon for Ross Ulbricht, the man who built Silk Road, a dark web marketplace that used Bitcoin for illegal drug sales and other underground goods. Trump actually called Ross’s mother personally to give her the news. Ross had been convicted in 2015 in New York on conspiracy charges related to narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and hacking. He was sentenced to two life terms plus 40 years, with no parole. Prosecutors said Silk Road handled more than $200 million in illegal transactions before being shut down in 2013. They also said Ross tried to hire people to kill six others, including a former employee of the site. No murders were ever carried out, but the government brought it up in court to show the extent of his criminal plans. Trump responded to critics of the pardon by posting on Truth Social. “The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponisation of government against me,” he wrote. “He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years.

In his appearance on Chain Reaction on March 28, Nailwal said recent market movement and ETH price stagnation have fueled rhetoric that can be perilous in the sense of being predicated on incorrect assumptions. If Ethereum goes down, the layer-2s won’t,” Nailwal emphasized, adding that pressuring Ethereum developers to prioritize price or politics over technology could “destroy the social fabric of Ethereum.” Vitalik Buterin’s Leadership in Uniting Ethereum Nailwal credited Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin with maintaining Ethereum’s growing ecosystem intact. Calling Buterin the “DNA of Ethereum,” he credited him with attracting high-talent developers and having a decentralized yet unified vision for Ethereum’s future. Reframing the Layer-1 vs Layer-2 Dichotomy Nailwal argued that the L1 vs L2 binary forgets the greater context. Instead, he asked the community to consider Ethereum a settlement layer like Bitcoin. “All other chains,” he said, “are execution layers,” which will eventually meet specific app requirements and deposit their final state into Ethereum or Bitcoin. This vision supports a future of app-blockchains economically anchored to Ethereum’s foundation layer, locking up its value with final settlement activity. Critics of Ethereum Are Missing the Long Game Despite concerns about plummeting L1 revenue—down 99% through September 2024—Nailwal scoffed at the idea that scaling networks harmed Ethereum. He pointed out that these execution layers expand the network’s reach, not diminish it. No other network is real competition to Ethereum, save perhaps Bitcoin—if it ever gets smart contract capabilities,” he added. The future of Ethereum, Nailwal suggests, hinges not on internal conflict but on collaborative growth, where L2s are not competitors but necessary extensions of Ethereum’s initial vision.",Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-28 19:59:29

In addition, analysts see the price target a post-launch to $3.50, representing the gain of 13,900% over the current stage. Metrics like this highlight why more than 7,000 holders are well in place ahead of wider market entry. The tiered nature of the presale builds urgency, with each step reducing access at the cheap price. The rapid fill rate in Phase 4 points to growing FOMO, as delays would mean missing out on the 20% price increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) based its value on a lending ecosystem, unlike speculative assets where users borrowed, lent, and earned with mtTokens, interest-accruing deposit certificates. Unlike Ethereum’s often transaction-heavy use cases, this model supports demand and smooths out volatility. Mechanics of Innovation Long-Term Demand Uninterrupted purchase pressure differentiates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) through its specific operations. Some platform charges automatically purchase MUTM tokens from market exchanges and redirect them to mtToken staking participants. Through the establishment of this loop users acquire assets longer term as sell-offs decrease thus maintaining consistent long-term price stability. The lending model places additional asset value above loans to decrease default possibilities thereby drawing in investors who take a guarded approach. P2P (Peer-to-Peer) lending has led to better utility because it lets users conduct negotiations for meme coins which are absent from standard liquidity pools. The combination of complete flexibility options and adjustable interest rates based on market trends makes MUTM emerge as a strong decentralized finance (DeFi) tool. The existing features attract presale investors who have already contributed $5.7 million while additional funds will come from liquidity mining and strategic partnerships when the platform launches. Security and Future Roadmap Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is wrapping up a smart contract audit with CertiK, a significant milestone that is likely to enhance investors’ confidence. Once available, results will be transmitted via official channels, ensuring transparency. Furthermore, the promise of a $100,000 giveaway for presale participants adds an element of speculative fun and excitement, rewarding the initial adopters. The project’s roadmap also includes the launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin to complement its ecosystem further. This stablecoin is decentralized and backed by user-deposited collateral, differentiating it from centralized alternatives that contradict DeFi principles. Along with deploying a token supply distributed across liquidity, development, and partnership, such innovations drive MUTM’s base for continued adoption. Posture for Exponential Growth As Ethereum faces a barrage on chain management and transaction fees, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be the sub-dollar exposure into DeFi’s lending sector—a vertical that’s more than due for stretching. Current presale price is still only a fraction of its $0.06 listing target, with post-launch predictions putting a potential rise to $3.50 as platform adoption picks up. MUTM Early investors secure triple figure returns at launch and so position for multi thousand percent gains when MUTM shakes out across the crypto space. As Phase 4 fills up fast and CertiK audit results are around the corner, the time is running out to get MUTM for only $0.025. To get in before prices increase, check out Mutuum Finance’s official site. Getting in today might well peg your stake to a project that will reshape decentralized finance — and yields like nothing else in the world of crypto.

After being pulled from the edge of bankruptcy in 2021 thanks to a surging stock price, the company has made sensible business decisions over the years, such as shrinking its physical footprint and focusing on higher-margin items. Now, GameStop is trying to secure its survival by investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ). This approach seems to have worked for Strategy, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin bank. Strategy has now amassed more than 500,000 BTC through successive purchases. And despite experiencing massive volatility, Strategy’s stock has rallied more than 2,100% since acquiring its first Bitcoin back in 2020. GameStop has memed its way back to relevance — who says it can’t secure at least the next decade of its existence by riding the Bitcoin wave? This week’s Crypto Biz newsletter chronicles GameStop’s Bitcoin gambit, the adoption magnet that is tokenization and the recovery in Bitcoin mining revenues. GameStop: Following the Strategy playbook On March 25, GameStop confirmed that it had received board approval to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins. There’s reason to believe that the video game retailer could make a big splash, given its corporate cash balance of nearly $4.8 billion. This is a notable jump from one year earlier when the company’s balance sheet was around $922 million. There’s also reason to believe that GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was orange-pilled by Michael Saylor after the two met in early February. Cohen confirmed that the meeting took place by posting an uncaptioned photo of him and Saylor on Feb. 8. Source: Ryan Cohen For his part, Saylor continues to accumulate as much BTC as humanly possible. Earlier in the week, he announced that Strategy had acquired another 6,911 BTC, bringing its stockpile to 506,137 BTC. Tokenized real estate comes to Polyon DigiShares has launched a real estate trading platform on Polygon , giving investors access to a liquid on- and off-ramp for commercial and residential properties. RealEstate.Exchange, also known as REX, launched with two luxury property listings in Miami, Florida, including a 520-unit tower and a 38-unit residential complex. A Google street view of one of the property listings, The Legacy Hotel & Residences in Miami, Florida. Source: Google Maps DigiShares CEO Claus Skaaning told Cointelegraph that REX has an additional five or six properties in the pipeline, adding that REX will eventually support all sorts of commercial and residential properties. REX operates in the United States through a license with Texture Capital, a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The platform is also seeking registrations in the European Union, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. Tokenized assets coming to CME CME Group, one of the world’s largest derivatives exchange operators, has tapped Google Cloud to roll out its asset tokenization program. Specifically, CME Group is using the Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL) to tokenize traditional assets on the blockchain — a move the company said would improve capital market efficiency and wholesale payments. Tokenization could “deliver significant efficiencies for collateral, margin, settlement and fee payments as the world moves toward 24/7 trading,” said Terry Duffy, CME Group’s Chairman and CEO. Although CME didn’t provide specific details about which assets would be part of the tokenization pilot, it plans to begin testing the technology with market participants next year. Bitcoin miner revenues stabilize post-halving Bitcoin miners are on track for recovery following the network’s April 2024 halving event, which reduced mining revenues from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. According to data from Coin Metrics, miner revenues are approaching $3.6 billion in the first quarter, which isn’t far off from the prior quarter’s $ 3.7 billion tally. It marks a major rebound from the third quarter of 2024 when revenues plunged to $2.6 billion. Miners have quickly adapted to the latest quadrennial halving, though revenues remain lower than the pre-halving peak in the first quarter of 2024. Source: Coin Metrics “With almost one year elapsed since Bitcoin’s 4th halving, miners have endured a period of stabilization, adapting to reduced block rewards, tighter margins, and shifting operational dynamics,” Coin Metrics said. Despite adverse market conditions since the halving, some miners are doubling down on their Bitcoin hodl strategy. Hive Digital’s chief financial officer told Cointelegraph that the company is focused on “retaining a significant portion of its mined Bitcoin to benefit from potential price appreciation.” Crypto Biz is your weekly pulse on the business behind blockchain and crypto, delivered directly to your inbox every Thursday.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-28 20:00:00

The former crypto executive was previously incarcerated in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, but Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) data indicates he now resides at FTC Oklahoma City, a transfer center that temporarily houses inmates being transported through the prison system. No reason for Bankman-Fried’s transfer was provided, but the FTX founder did recently conduct an unauthorized YouTube interview with conservative media personality Tucker Carlson. The New York Times, citing “a person briefed on the situation,” reported earlier this month that the unsanctioned conversation landed Bankman-Fried in solitary confinement. The FTX founder reportedly interviewed with Carlson as part of a longshot effort to secure a pardon from President Donald Trump. Crypto lobbyists are doubtful the disgraced FTX founder’s efforts will be successful, with one telling Fortune that Bankman-Fried had a “near zero” chance of landing the pardon. FTX imploded and filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 amid accusations that Bankman-Fried mishandled the exchange’s funds by loaning out billions of dollars’ worth of customer deposits to Alameda Research, the firm’s trading arm. The exchange’s multi-billion dollar collapse led to a sharp downtick in crypto prices, and US federal authorities arrested Bankman-Fried the following month. A US judge sentenced the FTX founder to 25 years in prison last year after he was convicted of fraud charges in 2023. His current release date is scheduled for November 17th, 2044, per FBOP data. Earlier this year, Bankman-Fried’s parents, Stanford Law School professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, reportedly met with lawyers and other figures considered close to Trump to discuss potential clemency for their son. Joseph Bankman even penned an opinion piece in the Washington Post (with Berkeley law professor Mark Gergen) praising Trump’s plan for a US sovereign wealth fund. Trump pardoned Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht in January, fulfilling a campaign promise to Libertarian voters. Bankman-Fried, however, has much less grassroots support than Ulbricht.

42545256,https://thecoinrise.com/meme-coin-bulls-get-ready-pepe-dragoin-could-lead-the-charge/,1743192025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42545256.jpeg,Meme Coin Bulls Get Ready—Pepe & Dragoin Could Lead the Charge,https://thecoinrise.com/meme-coin-bulls-get-ready-pepe-dragoin-could-lead-the-charge/,"After months of anticipation, the meme coin market might be preparing to erupt—and two names are pulling ahead fast. Pepe Coin (PEPE), a favorite among risk-loving traders, is sending clear technical signals that a breakout could be imminent. At the same time, Dragoin ($DDGN) , a newer Ethereum-based token, is catching serious attention with its red-hot presale and ambitious game-focused roadmap. As overall sentiment improves and liquidity begins to pour into higher-risk assets, both tokens are gaining traction—and those watching closely can see where this is heading. Historically, meme coins have been viewed as short-term hype plays. But this year, that mindset is shifting. Investors are looking for meme coins with depth—solid communities, functional tokenomics, and actual use cases. Pepe and Dragoin represent two very different strategies, but both could end up dominating the coming wave. Pepe Coin Eyes Breakout as Technicals Line Up Pepe Coin looks ready to move. Chart watchers have pointed to a clear ascending triangle forming on its daily timeframe—an often-reliable setup for bullish breakouts. As of late March, PEPE is sitting just beneath major resistance, with volume climbing and RSI pushing upward. According to CoinCentral data, PEPE’s current setup closely mirrors its last breakout in late 2024, when it soared over 300% in less than two weeks. Analysts now say a move above $0.000009 could trigger another big rally, especially as social chatter heats up and whale wallets begin accumulating again. Pepe isn’t offering much in terms of utility. But it thrives on culture, hype, and trading momentum—and that cocktail has worked before. While it might not be built for the long haul, its setup for short-term gains looks increasingly promising. Still, for investors thinking beyond meme trends and hunting for something more structured, Dragoin offers a different kind of play. Dragoin Raises the Bar With Utility, Scarcity, & Community Dragoin isn’t trying to follow the typical meme coin playbook—it’s rewriting it. Built on Ethereum and tied to a live Telegram-based game, Dragoin lets players hatch, train, and battle dragons for $DDGN rewards. This adds an interactive layer that most meme coins lack—and it’s already attracting attention from both gamers and crypto enthusiasts. Its presale format is just as strategic. Spread across 25 stages, the token price increases slightly with each new phase. Half of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens are locked into this process—and any tokens left unsold in a stage are permanently burned, cutting supply at every step. But it’s the long-term thinking that sets Dragoin apart. After the presale wraps up, developers will renounce the smart contract, giving full control to the community. Few meme coins take that leap—and those that do rarely have a structured economy to back it up. Looking ahead, Dragoin has a packed roadmap. Q2 2025 will bring the full game launch, staking options, and influencer-led marketing. Q3 promises exchange listings, game upgrades, and community governance features. With airdrops, referral rewards, and token use already live, Dragoin is building something designed to last—and grow. Market Conditions Give Meme Coins a Green Light Zooming out, the broader crypto market is creating the perfect storm for meme coin momentum. Bitcoin is holding strong above $85K, Ethereum is approaching $5K, and risk appetite is clearly rising. When these conditions align, meme coins often see the first and fastest inflows. Historically, meme coins act like early sparks for broader rallies. Their wild swings grab attention and draw in capital before the rest of the altcoin market catches up. That cycle appears to be starting again—and Pepe and Dragoin are right at the center of it. Pepe’s chart setup shows it’s ready to break out, and Dragoin’s explosive presale growth proves it’s gaining steam at just the right moment. While their approaches differ—Pepe riding the meme wave, Dragoin building a full ecosystem—both are positioned to benefit from what comes next. Two Meme Coins, Two Very Different Opportunities Meme coins aren’t what they used to be—and that’s a good thing. The space is evolving, and so are the tokens leading the charge. Pepe delivers fast-moving, high-volatility trades fueled by memes and momentum. Dragoin brings long-term potential through utility, community ownership, and deflationary design. As crypto markets gear up, early positioning in high-upside meme coins could be a game-changer. Pepe is flashing strong bullish signals, and Dragoin’s ecosystem is taking shape fast. Whether you’re after the thrill of the trade or the potential for 100x returns, these two tokens could define the next chapter in the meme coin story. Just remember: this isn’t about catching a trend—it’s about catching the right one.

The market-wide correction over the past 24 hours has weighed on Ethereum’s recovery momentum, and the leading altcoin has seen a dip in sentiment that could lead to a deeper decline or a sharp mid-term rebound. Short-term sentiment is cautious, but a new analysis from a well-followed crypto analyst has brought attention to a significant technical event that opens up a bullish perspective for the Ethereum price. Ethereum Hits 300-Week Moving Average Again: What Happened The Last Time? Taking to social media platform X, crypto analyst CryptoBullet pointed out that Ethereum has now touched the 300-week moving average for only the second time in its history. The first instance was in June 2022, during the market-wide crash that saw the Ethereum price plummet to as low as $880 before beginning a long, slow recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Maintains Movement Inside Ascending Triangle, Is Another Crash Coming? The second occurrence has come this month, March 2025, just as Ethereum continues to extend its struggles in gaining a footing above $2,000. With Ethereum touching the 300-week moving average again, we can only look back to see what happened last time to get a perspective of what to expect now. In June 2022, Ethereum’s touch of the 300-week moving average marked the beginning of a long-term recovery phase. After the bounce from that level, the Ethereum price surged more than 140% over the next eight weeks, eventually pushing above $2,100 in August 2022 before another correction. Mid-Term Rebound In Focus For ETH, But Resistance Ahead CryptoBullet noted the significance of this moving average, framing it as a key historical support zone. The analyst argued that regardless of bearish sentiment in the short term, this kind of macro-level support typically sets the stage for a meaningful bounce. Related Reading: Ethereum In 2024 Vs. 2025: What Important Technical Indicators Are Saying “Even if you’re a bear, you can’t deny that we hit a very important support level,” he wrote, adding that his price target for the coming bounce is between $2,900 and $3,200. Nonetheless, the bounce will depend on how the Ethereum price reacts to the level, as a continued downside move would cancel out any bullish momentum. For now, Ethereum’s price is trapped under bearish sentiment, and bulls will need to reclaim the $2,000 zone before any sustainable bounce toward the $2,900 and $3,200 range can begin to materialize. Furthermore, the recent price correction in the past 24 hours increases the risks of the Ethereum price closing March below the 3M Bollinger bands, which is currently just around $2,000. A close below the 3M Bollinger bands could spell trouble for the leading altcoin. However, if CryptoBullet’s analysis proves to be accurate, Ethereum may soon enter a period of stronger price action that plays out over the coming weeks. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,907, down by 5.82% in the past 24 hours.

Trump reportedly also pardoned Hayes’ co-founders at BitMEX, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) brought charges against BitMEX, its three co-founders, and its first employee, Gregory Dwyer, accusing them of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Prosecutors alleged BitMEX advertised itself as a place where customers could use its platform virtually anonymously, without providing basic know-your-customer (KYC) information. All four individuals eventually pleaded guilty and were sentenced to fines and probationary sentences. The exchange itself pleaded guilty to violating the BSA last year. Hayes faced two years of probation; Delo spent 30 months and Reed 18 months. Dwyer got 12 months of probation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered BitMEX to pay $100 million for violating the Commodity Exchange Act and other CFTC regulations in 2021, separately from its DOJ settlements. Attorneys representing Hayes, Delo and Reed did not immediately return requests for comment. The reported pardons come just a day after Trump granted a pardon to Trevor Milton, the former CEO of Nikola Motors who was previously convicted of fraud in 2022. In January, Trump made good on long-standing promises to pardon Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, who was 11 years into a draconian sentence of double life in prison plus 40 years, with no possibility of parole. Since Ulbricht’s pardon, former FTX CEO and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried has been angling for his own pardon, attempting to curry favor with the Trump administration and appearing on Tucker Carlson in an unauthorized jailhouse interview that landed him in solitary confinement. Former Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, who pleaded guilty to the same charge as Hayes and served four months in prison last year — making him not only the richest person to ever go to prison in the U.S., but also the only person to ever serve jail time for violating the BSA — has denied reports that he, too, is seeking a pardon from President Trump. But, Zhao admitted in a recent X post that “no felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge.”",Policy|BitMEX|Arthur Hayes|Trump,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|COMMODITY|BNB|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-28 20:04:27

The revision was issued by Edison Yu, who still maintains a buy rating on the stock despite the downgrade. Yu said the new target is 26% higher than Tesla’s Thursday closing price, but the forecast reflects a sharp decline in performance. Yu now expects Tesla to deliver between 340,000 and 350,000 vehicles in the first quarter. That’s well below the sell-side consensus of 378,000, and would be an 11% drop from the same time last year. Compared to the previous quarter, the decline hits 30%, making this the lowest delivery count since Q3 of 2022. Yu added that this drop “likely means auto margin will also be under greater pressure.” Analysts flag delivery declines, brand issues, and political exposure Yu said Tesla’s stock has taken a hit from weak delivery volumes, a wider sell-off in growth stocks like the Mag 7, and policy uncertainty tied to politics. He wrote: “Our view is that Tesla’s stock has been under pressure recently driven by much weaker auto volumes, broader de-rating in growth assets (e.g., Mag 7), and to some extent, political/policy uncertainty.” He warned that things at Tesla rarely follow a predictable path and noted that neither the company’s robotaxi program nor its humanoid project should be expected to scale in a straight line. Yu also pointed to ongoing “brand damage” tied to Elon Musk’s political activity, saying it could lower demand. He said he plans to monitor that trend closely. While the U.S. presidential shift back to Donald Trump adds more risk, Tesla may be better prepared than others if Trump moves forward with his plan to apply a 25% tariff on all foreign-made vehicles. Yu said that Tesla could still take a hit from the tariff, especially because 20–25% of some models rely on parts made in Mexico. But he added that the impact should be small under the current trade guidelines. “While the new 25% tariffs can hurt Tesla, mainly on the Mexico content (20-25% depending on the model), we estimate very minimal impact under the current guidelines (powertrain, electronic components) given Tesla likely sources mostly low value-add items from there,” he wrote. HSBC slashes target and questions Tesla’s product strength At HSBC, analyst Michael Tyndall dropped his price target by $35, bringing it down to $130. That suggests a 52.2% fall from Wednesday’s closing price. Tyndall said there are “no quick fixes” to Tesla’s current issues. In a Thursday note to clients, he wrote, “The seeds for the current sales weakness pre-date the recent brand issues.” Tyndall pointed to trouble in China, where he said Tesla’s older product lineup and limited driver-assist tech are hurting sales. He also said Tesla is losing out in Europe, where fleet buyers make up 60% of new car sales. He explained that the company has ignored some key industry practices like regular model updates and price changes, which could now be costing them. “Tesla eschews many of the industry norms (holding list prices firm, making regular facelifts and model renewals) and has to date seen only minimal impact, but tougher competition and brand erosion is likely to see the impact of its strategy hurt more,” Tyndall wrote. Tyndall also pushed back on the timeline for Tesla’s robotaxi plans, saying the future opportunity is too far off. He cited a report from early March that used crowdsourced data to show progress in Tesla’s autonomous driving tech is either “slow or stagnating.” He added, “Delays have been a constant theme at Tesla, whereas the competitive threats continue to grow. We see a longer and less certain timeline than the current valuation reflects.” Despite the recent 9.3% gain in Tesla stock this week, shares are still down over 32% in 2025. The recent bump hasn’t fixed the long-term drop, and investor confidence remains mixed. Out of the 54 analysts currently tracking the stock, 26 rate it as a buy or strong buy, 16 have it listed as a hold, and 12 are advising underperform or sell, based on coverage numbers shared by LSEG.

The announcement comes as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that digital asset derivatives wouldn’t be treated differently than any other derivatives. The FDIC letter rescinds a previous instruction under former US President Joe Biden’s administration that required institutions to notify the agency before engaging in crypto-related activities. According to the FDIC’s definition: ”Crypto-related activities include, but are not limited to, acting as crypto-asset custodians; maintaining stablecoin reserves; issuing crypto and other digital assets; acting as market makers or exchange or redemption agents; participating in blockchain- and distributed ledger-based settlement or payment systems, including performing node functions; as well as related activities such as finder activities and lending.” FDIC-supervised institutions should consider associated risks when engaging in crypto-related activities, it said. These risks include market and liquidity risks, operational and cybersecurity risks, consumer protection requirements, and Anti-Money Laundering requirements. On March 25, the FDIC eliminated the “reputational risk” category from bank exams, opening a path for banks to work with digital assets. Reputational risk is a term that underscores the dangers banks face when engaging with certain industries. Related: FDIC resists transparency on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 — Coinbase CLO Digital asset derivatives won’t be treated differently — CFTC While the US crypto derivatives market had been a gray zone due to regulatory uncertainty, that has been changing. On March 28, the CFTC withdrew a staff advisory letter to ensure that digital asset derivatives — a type of trading product — will not be treated differently from other types of derivatives. The revision is “effective immediately.” The change in tone from the CFTC and FDIC follows a new environment for crypto firms under US President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump has vowed to make the US “ the crypto capital of the planet .” Crypto firms are shifting strategies to align with the easing regulatory climate. On March 10, Coinbase announced the offer of 24/7 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) futures. In addition, the company is reportedly planning to acquire Derebit , a crypto derivatives exchange. Kraken, another US-based cryptocurrency exchange, has also made moves in the derivatives market. On March 20, it announced the acquisition of NinjaTrader , which would allow the exchange to offer crypto futures and derivatives in the United States.

This can be attributed to profit-taking after a short-lived rally above $16 earlier this week. However, key stakeholders have added 8.3% more LINK to their wallets in just six months, which could lead to a price reversal in the short-term. LINK Accumulation According to Santiment’s latest analysis , there has been a surge in Chainlink’s social dominance, which has coincided with a private meetup involving important US government leaders. Amidst these developments, wallets holding between 10,000 and 10,000,000 LINK have expanded their stash to an all-time high of 438.33 million LINK, representing 43.8% of the total supply. In fact, this cohort of whales and sharks has added 26 million LINK tokens since September 2024, while social media discussions on LINK have reached their highest levels since October 2024. Such an accumulation trend underscored growing confidence among major investors amid rising social media discussions. Meanwhile, Chainlink also remains the frontrunner in development activity within the real-world assets (RWA) sector. The decentralized oracle network has surpassed competitors like Synthetix (SNX), Maker, Dusk Foundation (DUSK), and Reserve Protocol (RSR). As per Santiment’s data , Chainlink has logged approximately 586 noteworthy GitHub events in the last 30 days, highlighting its active development efforts. Chainlink Ecosystem Developments On the ecosystem side of things, Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the international financial hub of the UAE capital, recently entered into a memorandum of understanding with Chainlink to develop regulatory frameworks for tokenized assets. Through this partnership, ADGM will leverage Chainlink’s blockchain solutions, which include data feeds and interoperability services, in a bid to advance its blockchain innovation initiatives under its Registration Authority. Chainlink reported that its technology has facilitated more than $20 trillion in global transactions and has been adopted by some of the leading financial institutions. More recently, in a near-unanimous decision, the Aave DAO community has integrated Chainlink’s Smart Value Recapture (SVR) on the Ethereum Mainnet to mitigate oracle-related MEV losses, starting with an initial set of markets. This initiative will initially be applied to a select group of markets, but its adoption is expected to set the stage for DeFi applications to retain MEV that was previously siphoned off by blockchain networks.

Over the past week, ADA has been consolidating in a narrow range between $0.69 and $0.75. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels However, due to a bearish market sentiment and a notable price decline, ADA has reached the lower boundary of the zone and is on the verge of breaking out of this consolidation. According to expert technical analysis, ADA has turned bearish and weak as it falls below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. Despite the weak and bearish trend, if the asset price falls below the $0.69 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 9% to reach $0.64 in the coming days. Source: Coinglass However, historically, whenever ADA’s price reached the lower boundary of consolidation, it experienced an upside move along with buying pressure. However, this time, the sentiment is entirely bearish, and major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are influencing the overall market, increasing the probability of ADA dropping to the $0.64 level in the coming days. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.695, registering a 6% price decline over the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume jumped by 30%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Key Liquidation Levels Meanwhile, with the bearish market sentiment and ADA trading at a crucial level, traders’ outlook appears to have shifted as they are strongly betting on the short side. Source: Coinglass Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that traders are heavily over-leveraged at $0.715, with $11.15 million worth of short positions. However, bulls are over-leveraged at $0.687, having built $6.51 million worth of long positions, clearly indicating that bears are currently dominating the asset.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 20:09:49
