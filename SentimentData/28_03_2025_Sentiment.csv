The cryptocurrency with a total value of $201,400 was traced to fundraising addresses allegedly controlled by Hamas and used to launder more than $1.5 million in digital assets since October 2024. The laundering occurred through a series of “virtual currency exchanges and transactions by leveraging suspected financiers and over-the-counter brokers,” the DOJ said. The funds are currently held in a combination of at least 17 wallets. Affidavit to seize the Hamas-linked cryptocurrency. Source: US DOJ In January 2024, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, along with corresponding organizations in the United Kingdom and Australia, announced sanctions against networks and facilitators of crypto transactions linked to Hamas. Those sanctions were built on US Treasury sanctions from October 2023. In January 2024, three families of victims of the Hamas attack against Israel sued Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao , alleging that the exchange had provided “substantial assistance” to terrorists. In oral arguments, a lawyer representing Binance claimed the exchange had “no special relationship [with] Hamas .” Binance has faced scrutiny from the US government over alleged shortcomings in its Anti-Money Laundering controls. The exchange settled with the DOJ for $4.3 billion in November 2023. More regulation needed? According to a December 2024 report by the Congressional Research Service, Hamas has allegedly sought cryptocurrency donations since at least 2019, although the “scale and effectiveness” of these efforts have been unclear. Terrorist organizations using crypto for fundraising have increasingly drawn the attention of the US, with some officials questioning whether the industry needed more supervision or regulation to stop such behavior. According to a 2023 Chainalysis report, terrorism financing accounts for a very small amount of crypto usage, with illegal groups sticking to using traditional, fiat-based methods to fund operations.

This time, the spotlight was on Token2049, a prominent cryptocurrency event that is expected to attract major industry players in three separate events later this year. The alert warned members of the group to be wary of sponsors as the event approaches because conveners typically do very little due diligence on these supporters. “Just because someone is a title or platinum sponsor does not mean they are credible,” Zach wrote. Zach blow s wh istle about shady and sketchy Token2049 sponsors The report listed Spacecoin as the title sponsor of the upcoming event, but according to Zach, it is a “botted project.” Connect with @_spacecoin , Title Sponsor of #TOKEN2049 Dubai! Spacecoin is the world’s first DePIN powered by satellites, building trustless, decentralized internet connectivity on a global scale. Learn more: https://t.co/ove4Sodour pic.twitter.com/n6DMQ1rZgm — TOKEN2049 (@token2049) March 20, 2025 A quick look at Spacecoin’s page revea ls i t is aiming to be the world’s first DePIN project that is powered by satellites. It claims its “decentralized satellite constellation provides global 5G internet access to the 2.9 billion people who remain unconnected” and has lofty ambitions of connecting the world via its satellites. The term “botted” can be interpreted in a number of ways in crypto, but none is flattering. On the bright side, its name appears alongside platforms like OKX, BloFin, MEXC, KuCoi n and Binance as “title sponsors. ” The on-chain sleuth also tagged Bitunix, JuCoin, WEEX, and DWF, which Token2049 lists as platinum sponsors as “sketchy. ” Zach pointed out in his report that the teams he mentioned are the ones on his radar for now. However, he expects the list to grow longer before the first event starts in April. For the centralized exchanges that made the “sketchy” list, Zach said he checked to verify if the team is public and has a prior work history in the space. The listed platform s including Bitunix, JuCoin, & WEE X all failed this test. Bitunix, which Zach described as a “sketchy exchange,” is an actual cryptocurrency exchange registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and it offers spot and futures trading. Some days ago , a report revealed that Bitunix is being targeted by South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) for providing services to Korean customers without proper registration. The crypto platform reportedly operates Korean-language websites and provides market and customer support activities targeted to Korean investors without notifying authorities or filing for a VASP license. JuCoin, also tagged “sketchy” by Zach, is another exchange, previously known as Jubi. It may have gotten on Zach’s radar because it has a history of ownership changes, rebrand s and regulatory pivots. Ironically, the exchange announced that it had applied for its VASP license to operate in Taiwan, stating that it “is taking the lead in Taiwan’s compliance process by officially applying for regulatory licenses, implementing KYC systems. ” Another eyebrow-raiser may be that JuCoin is not regulated in the US, EU, or other major markets with strict regulatory standards, except for an exemption from Singapore’s Monetary Authority. WEEX, another sketch y company according to Zach , is a crypto futures exchange established in 2018 and registered in Singapore. The doubts about the exchange are because it is not regulated by a financial authority with strict standards. There have also been social media posts complaining of weird behavior on the exchange, such as frozen accounts and unwarranted KYC issues. DWF, tagged as a “sketchy market maker,” is a known Web3 investor and market maker, trading on over 60 exchanges and involved in high-profile investments. It may have been included on Zach’s list because of past accusations of wash trading as a market maker and the more recent rug allegation from Vite Labs. Vite Labs made the rug allegation hours ago today, March 27, 2025. The allegation was shared on the project’s X page and claimed that “the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. ” “We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled,” the post from Vite Labs concluded . Hi guys we want to update that the funds left for development got rugged by @DWF market making service and @binance delist decision. We will only maintain the network until we can no longer support it. All roadmap plans are cancelled. — Vite Labs 🏃🏻‍♂️ (@vitelabs) March 27, 2025 In the comments section of the post, people demanded more information on how DWF Labs may have rugged the fund s, but Vite Labs did not provide any further explanation. As for Binance, it claimed that it delisted Vite Labs’ token because it no longer met certain requirements. The wash trading allegation linked to DWF Labs came in May 2024. It accused the market maker of conducting over $300 million in wash trades across seven tokens in 2023, manipulating the price of Yield Guild Games’ native token , Y GG and other cryptocurrencies. Binance refuted the allegations, claiming that the transactions were proprietary and were free o f manipulati on while accusing the head of the monitoring team of collaboration with DWF’s competitors, leading to his termination. Binance has affirmed its strict market surveillance program and commitment to combating market abuse. The exchange has said that it does not tolerate manipulation practices and has dismissed nearly 355,000 users with a transaction volume of over $2.5 trillion for violating its terms of use in the past couple of years. The danger of sketchy platforms posing as sponsor s A sketch y character sponsoring an event, brand, or politician happe ns in all spheres of life, including crypto. It does not happen often at the Token204 9 eve nt but a case was recorded not too long ag o whi ch had disastrous consequences . Za ch in hi s repo rt highlighted one incident from late 2023 when a sketchy exchange known as JPEX was chosen as a platinum sponsor for that year’s Token 2049 conference. The team was flagged by the Hong Kong government during the conference as an unlicensed company with allegedly “suspiciou s features .” After victims made abou t 14 00 reports to law enforcement, about 70 people were arrested by the police in connection with the HK$1.6 billion JPEX cryptocurrenc y scand al and nearly HK$230 million (US$29.37 million) in assets were immediately frozen. The scandal was tagged Hong Kong’s biggest case of alleged financial fraud. Despite all the heat, the platform remained defiant, hitting users with an exorbitant fee for virtual asset withdrawals. Police Commissioner Raymond Siu Chak-yee later revea led the number of arrests related to the case had shot up t o 72 and about HK$228 million had been frozen. “The force has received 2,636 reports with regard to the case as of today, and the amount involved is about HK$1.6 billion,” he said. Among those previously arrested were social media influencers who had appeared in adverts for the trading platform and set up their own over-the-counter shops. These included Chan Wing-yee, Joseph La m Ch ok and Sheena Leung. We're thrilled to be partnering for TOKEN2049, a key crypto event!

Another example of a crypto project that employed this tactic is Centra Tech, a fraudulent crypto project that leveraged celebrity endorsements and event appearances to gain credibility. With its antics, it secured $32 million in funding through an ICO, claiming to offer a debit card for crypto payments. Those behind it went as far as talking about it at events, touting fake partnerships with Visa and Mastercard. The SEC charged them with fraud in 2018, and co-founder Sohrab Sharma was sentenced to eight years in prison. An even more popular example is the FTX saga. FTX, now a bankrupt exchange, used its significant political influence, which it got by sponsoring politicians, to enhance its reputation. Its form er CEO S am Bankman-Fr ied would donate millions to political campaigns in the US, including $1 million to a McConnell-aligned super PAC days before FTX’s 2022 collapse. The purpose of the spending was to keep FTX on the favorable side of regulation, but in the end, FTX was exposed for misappropriating $10 billion in customer funds, leading to Bankman-Fried’s conviction in 2023.

New processes reduce friction and simplify crypto transactions. Enhanced security and clear rules boost user confidence. This approach may widen access in underserved areas. Although Bitcoin (BTC) has long been perceived as a store of value, analysts in 2024 predicted that its next major use case could emerge in the form of payments, driven by shifting regulations and increasing infrastructure support. According to EMARKETER , crypto payment adoption was expected to grow by 82.1% over two years beginning in 2024, supported by friendlier regulations and expanding payment provider networks . Source: EMARKETER A Bitget Wallet report also highlighted security concerns as the biggest barrier to crypto payment adoption. What’s driving crypto payment adoption and what’s holding it back? We surveyed 4,599 users to uncover key trends shaping the future of PayFi Here’s the key findings from our 2025 PayFi Report! pic.twitter.com/yycmW7OcWO — Bitget Wallet (@BitgetWallet) March 25, 2025 The report, which surveyed 4,599 users, found that over 37% of respondents considered security risks the main obstacle to using cryptocurrency for payments. Other concerns included irreversible transactions and a lack of legal protection. Source: Bitget Wallet Simplifying Crypto Payments With Traditional Platforms In response to ongoing security and usability issues, some platforms have started to streamline the crypto payment process to encourage broader usage. Bakhrom Saydulloev, a product lead at payments infrastructure firm Mercuryo , told Cryptonews that crypto payments had shown consistent growth despite wider market fluctuations. “The data supports this outlook, as Mercuryo is observing steady growth in payment volumes across our ecosystem despite broader market fluctuations,” said Saydulloev. Saydulloev noted that user experience remains a major hurdle. “Many products remain unnecessarily complex, fostering friction at every step from account opening to completing transactions,” he remarked. “Beyond these issues, users simply want what they expect from any payment system: low costs, speed, and safety.” Saydulloev noted that Mercuryo had begun integrating traditional payment methods to address these issues. For example, the company partnered with Revolut Pay, a mainstream online payment platform, to make buying and selling crypto more accessible. “Revolut Pay simplifies buying crypto assets to a single click,” Saydulloev said. “The platform also has reinforced security features, including biometric technology and passcodes that secure the crypto purchasing process for users.” Crypto exchange CEX.IO has also adopted traditional methods to simplify crypto transactions. Alexander Kerya, vice president of product management at CEX.IO, said the platform recently integrated with MoneyGram to support cash-in and cash-out services for USDC. “This integration facilitates crypto cash-in and cash-out services, enabling seamless conversion of Circle’s USDC stablecoin into physical cash and vice versa,” Kerya said. Kerya added that he believes the growing collaboration between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto services is gradually blurring the lines between these two industries. Regulatory Support for Crypto Payment Adoption These platform efforts coincide with evolving regulatory frameworks that support safer adoption. Bitget Wallet’s report shows that 27% of investors are worried about the lack of legal protection. This signals the need for better safeguards and regulatory clarity around crypto payments. Saydulloev highlighted regulatory progress in the EU and UK. Frameworks such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) now allow credit institutions to issue crypto assets under their existing banking licenses. “Rather than hindering innovation, these regulations create essential trust by establishing consistent rules and protections, which are prerequisites for wider adoption,” Saydulloev commented. Coinbase has also focused on easing friction around crypto payments, particularly stablecoins. A company spokesperson noted that free USDC transfers and fiat onramps make it easier for users to send and receive crypto. Coinbase’s layer-2 network, Base, also allows near-instant crypto transactions with very low fees. Statistics from CoinGate , a payment platform, show that stablecoins are becoming a preferred method for crypto payments. In 2024, stablecoins accounted for 35.5% of transactions on the platform, with USDT making up 97.2% of those, followed by USDC at 2.5% and DAI at 0.3%. Global Demand for Faster, Accessible Crypto Payments While adoption in developed regions remains gradual, crypto payments are gaining traction in emerging markets with limited banking access. Bitget Wallet’s data showed that 46% of users prefer crypto payments over fiat due to speed and efficiency. Interest was particularly strong in Africa and Southeast Asia, where 52% and 51% of respondents, respectively, expressed interest in using crypto for payments. Rich Rine, an initial contributor at Core DAO, told Cryptonews that in developing regions, crypto is more than just an alternative—it’s often the first access to financial infrastructure. “In regions with large unbanked or underbanked populations, crypto payments are a 0 to 1 leap in trust and access,” Rine said. “It’s not about replacing a legacy system; it’s about gaining access to a system in the first place.” Rine added that for adoption to grow in the US and Europe, payment solutions must compete with existing systems that offer fraud protection and chargebacks. “This likely requires clearer regulatory frameworks – especially around stablecoins – and tighter integration between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi) ,” he said. For example, he suggested that banks could offer fraud protection and chargeback services on top of stablecoin rails, helping users benefit from fast infrastructure without sacrificing security. Beyond security and infrastructure, financial incentives may also shape the future of crypto-based transactions. “This adds complexity, but also introduces the idea that payments themselves could become productive, not just functional,” he said. Building Trust and Access The drive to simplify crypto payments speaks to a deeper call for secure and inclusive financial services. Traditional banks and digital providers now work side by side to build systems that users can rely on. Their combined focus on safety and usability has the power to expand access for those left behind by older models. This collaboration opens new doors for trust and participation in financial affairs. Think about how this blend of old and new might expand opportunities for you and your community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How will combining traditional banking with crypto payments alter consumer use? Integrating established banking methods with digital assets offers a smoother transaction experience. This approach combines secure, familiar processes with quicker crypto transfers, lowering hurdles for daily payments. What benefits can merchants and users expect from a streamlined crypto process? A streamlined process reduces transaction friction for both merchants and consumers. By integrating secure, known banking practices, it provides faster service and ease of use, promoting smoother digital trade. How can regulators and industry leaders work together to build trust in simplified crypto payments? Regulators and industry players must establish clear, consistent rules that merge secure traditional practices with modern digital tools. This cooperative effort fosters trust and promotes broader user confidence.

However, a new type of digital fund, yield-bearing stablecoins , is gaining traction in the industry. These tokens offer interest to investors, similar to how savings accounts in traditional banks work. JPMorgan analysts, led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, believe yield-bearing stablecoins could grow massively in the coming years. Currently, these stablecoins make up just 6% of the stablecoin market. Panigirtzoglou suggests they could grow to 50% if regulatory hurdles do not slow them down. Why More Investors Are Choosing Yield-Bearing Stablecoins JPMorgan analysts say more people choose yield-bearing stablecoins because they offer interest without risk. Panigirtzoglou explained that investors do not need to trade or lend money; just holding these treasury funds is enough. These stablecoins have grown fast in recent months. Since the U.S. election in November 2024, the top five treasury-backed assets have increased in value. This includes Ethena’s USDe, Sky Dollar’s USDS, BlackRock’s BUIDL, Usual Protocol’s USD0, and Ondo Finance’s USDY. Their market cap has jumped from $4 billion to over $13 billion. As traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) platform yields have dropped, more investors are turning to them. Crypto trading platforms now accept tokenized U.S. Treasurys as collateral, making earning interest while holding assets easier. Additionally, well-known crypto projects like Frax Finance are now using these stablecoins, which is pushing the trend further. The SEC’s Approval Could Open the Door for More Growth Despite their fast growth, yield-bearing stablecoins still face challenges. They are classified as securities, which creates legal issues and limits their use, especially for everyday investors. However, things might be changing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved a new yield-bearing tokens called YLDS, which is registered as a security. This could open the door for more stablecoins like it. Traditional stables, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, do not share their earnings with users because doing so would make them securities. That would bring stricter rules, making them harder to use in crypto transactions. More companies might follow this model with the SEC approving a yield-bearing stablecoin. Will Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Replace Traditional Ones? Unlike traditional stablecoins with a $220 billion market cap, these newer assets have lower liquidity and are not widely used. However, JPMorgan analysts believe these obstacles may fade as more traders and projects adopt them. As more traders and crypto projects use yield-bearing tokens, their liquidity could improve. This could make them widely used as collateral in crypto trading, part of DAO treasuries, or even a way for crypto investment funds to store idle cash.

After a quiet spell, the past week has brought renewed life to the market. Solana’s BONK posted double-digit gains with impressive volume, while Dragoin ($DDGN) captured growing interest with its interactive play-to-earn design. Investors are once again paying attention—not just to hype, but to tokens that offer real engagement and growth potential. BONK and Dragoin are showing they’re not just participating in the trend—they’re shaping it. BONK Posts Big Gains & Surges in Trading Activity BONK, the top meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, has staged a significant comeback. On March 24, 2025, the token gained 14.8% within a single day, bringing its price to $0.00002507. But even more notable was its trading volume, which hit $210 million—one of the highest totals across the entire crypto market that day. This wasn’t just a random bump in interest. BONK’s performance came on the back of new exchange listings, growing developer involvement within Solana, and a fresh wave of social media activity. Analysts also highlight recent token burn announcements and community-led efforts as key drivers. As BONK bounces back from a challenging earlier stretch this year, many now see it as a core part of Solana’s push into DeFi and NFTs. Still, BONK’s rapid movement reflects how quickly meme coins can respond to sudden buzz. A listing or tweet can change everything—but how long that energy lasts remains uncertain. That’s where Dragoin offers a more carefully structured alternative, built for durability. Dragoin Builds a Strong Foundation Around Utility & Engagement While BONK is making headlines, Dragoin ($DDGN) is steadily building a following. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, this Ethereum-based token is focusing on creating a lasting ecosystem. It combines entertainment with real incentives, setting it apart in a crowded field. At the center of Dragoin is a Telegram-based play-to-earn game. Players can hatch, train, and battle dragons, earning $DDGN tokens along the way. It’s not just for fun—it’s a system that turns participation into value. Users aren’t just buying and holding; they’re actively engaging, competing, and growing the network. Dragoin’s structure is another key to its appeal. It has a 200 billion token supply, with 50% allocated to a presale divided into 25 pricing stages. As each stage progresses, the price increases. Unsold tokens won’t linger—they’ll be permanently burned, increasing scarcity. The remaining tokens support liquidity, rewards, and development, with only 5% locked for the team under a two-year vesting schedule. That level of clarity and planning is still rare among meme projects. Dragoin’s next steps are already mapped out. In Q2 2025, it will roll out the full game, launch staking options, and expand with influencer collaborations. Q3 is set to bring listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, along with more in-game features. While the online buzz is growing fast, the plan behind it is focused on lasting growth—not quick spikes. Meme Coins Are Growing Up—And So Are Their Audiences The strong rise of both BONK and Dragoin signals that meme coins are evolving—and so are the expectations of those investing in them. The market is no longer driven only by names or memes. It’s about utility, community, and what comes next. BONK, already established and widely recognized, is showing how a meme coin can adapt and align with a broader blockchain vision. Its recent trading activity and increased exchange visibility suggest that it’s becoming more than just a cultural relic—it’s taking on a strategic role in Solana’s crypto growth. Dragoin, on the other hand, represents a fresh direction. It’s not leaning on nostalgia. It’s offering a hands-on experience, paired with a token model that encourages long-term engagement. The combination of gaming, decentralization, and deflationary mechanics is striking a chord with a new wave of users who want to do more than just hold. Together, these two projects highlight different paths to success. BONK reflects resilience and evolution. Dragoin, meanwhile, offers innovation and a new kind of interaction. Both are thriving—but each is writing its own unique story in the next chapter of meme coins.

42500579,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144062,1743116442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Major Crypto Seizure: US DoJ Targets Hamas Terrorism Financing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unveiling-crypto-seizure-doj/,"In a significant move highlighting the ongoing battle against illicit finance in the digital age, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) has announced the seizure of approximately $200,000 in cryptocurrency. This crypto seizure targeted a digital wallet allegedly linked to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The operation underscores the increasing scrutiny on cryptocurrency’s role in funding illegal activities and the proactive measures law enforcement agencies are taking to counter it. This incident also brings to the forefront critical questions about the use of digital assets in terrorism financing and the evolving regulatory landscape. What Exactly Happened with this Crypto Seizure? According to the DoJ, the seized cryptocurrency originated from a wallet believed to be controlled by Hamas. While the immediate seizure amounted to $200,000, authorities suspect this wallet was part of a larger network responsible for laundering around $1.5 million in funds for the organization. This operation is not isolated; it’s part of a broader effort by the U.S. government to disrupt and dismantle financial networks supporting terrorist groups. The details released by the DoJ indicate a sophisticated investigation that traced the flow of funds through the blockchain to identify and ultimately seize the assets. This successful crypto seizure is a testament to the growing capabilities of law enforcement in tracking and intercepting illicit cryptocurrency transactions. Why is Hamas Crypto Usage a Concern? The use of cryptocurrency by groups like Hamas raises several red flags. Here’s why this is a significant concern: Anonymity and Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies, by nature, offer a degree of anonymity and operate outside traditional financial systems. This decentralization can be exploited to evade detection and sanctions, making it challenging for authorities to track and control financial flows. Ease of Cross-Border Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are borderless, enabling groups to receive and transfer funds internationally without relying on traditional banking infrastructure. This ease of cross-border movement complicates efforts to monitor and intercept funds intended for illicit purposes, including terrorism financing. Lower Transaction Fees: Compared to traditional banking systems, cryptocurrency transactions often involve lower fees, making them an attractive option for frequent and large-scale money movements, even for activities like terrorism financing. Potential for Fundraising: Cryptocurrencies can be used to solicit donations globally through online platforms and social media. This fundraising mechanism can be particularly effective for groups seeking to operate outside the purview of traditional financial regulations. The recent crypto seizure highlights these vulnerabilities and underscores the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to combat the misuse of digital assets for illegal activities like terrorism financing. The Role of the DOJ in Combating Terrorism Financing The Department of Justice (DOJ) plays a crucial role in the U.S. government’s efforts to combat terrorism financing. Its responsibilities encompass a wide range of activities, including: Area Description Investigation and Prosecution The DoJ investigates and prosecutes individuals and entities involved in financing terrorism. This includes tracing financial flows, identifying facilitators, and bringing legal action against those who provide material support to terrorist organizations. Asset Forfeiture As demonstrated by this crypto seizure, the DoJ utilizes asset forfeiture laws to seize and confiscate assets derived from or used to facilitate terrorism financing. This disrupts the financial resources available to terrorist groups and prevents them from using these funds for further illicit activities. International Cooperation The DoJ works closely with international partners to share information, coordinate investigations, and extradite individuals involved in terrorism financing. This global collaboration is essential to address the transnational nature of terrorist financing networks. Policy and Strategy Development The DoJ contributes to the development of national policies and strategies to counter terrorism financing. This includes working with other government agencies and international bodies to enhance legal frameworks and improve enforcement mechanisms. The successful crypto seizure operation against Hamas is a clear example of the DOJ’s proactive approach and effectiveness in disrupting terrorist financing networks. How Does Crypto Laundering Work and How is it Being Addressed? Crypto laundering, the process of concealing the origin of cryptocurrency obtained illegally, is a growing concern for law enforcement agencies worldwide. The methods employed by criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but so are the tools and techniques to counter them. Here’s a breakdown of how crypto laundering works and the measures being taken to address it: Common Crypto Laundering Techniques: Tumblers and Mixers: These services obscure the transaction history by mixing various cryptocurrency transactions together, making it harder to trace the original source of funds. Privacy Coins: Cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash offer enhanced privacy features, making transactions more difficult to trace compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Layered Transactions: Launderers may use multiple wallets and exchanges, moving funds through a complex web of transactions to obfuscate the money trail. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): DEXs often have less stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements compared to centralized exchanges, providing avenues for laundering funds with reduced scrutiny. Cross-Chain Swaps: Converting cryptocurrencies across different blockchains can also be used to complicate tracing efforts. Addressing Crypto Laundering: Enhanced Regulations: Governments and regulatory bodies are implementing stricter regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, including robust KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements. Blockchain Analytics Tools: Sophisticated blockchain analytics tools are being developed and utilized by law enforcement and financial institutions to trace cryptocurrency transactions, identify suspicious patterns, and uncover laundering schemes. International Collaboration: Global cooperation among law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies is crucial for sharing information, coordinating investigations, and establishing international standards to combat crypto laundering. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government agencies and the cryptocurrency industry is essential to develop effective solutions and best practices for preventing and detecting crypto laundering. The seizure of funds from the Hamas wallet underscores the effectiveness of these countermeasures and the ongoing efforts to refine and improve them. The fight against crypto laundering is a continuous process that requires constant adaptation and innovation. What are the Broader Implications of this Hamas Crypto Case? This particular crypto seizure case has broader implications for the cryptocurrency world and beyond: Legitimacy of Crypto Under Scrutiny: Incidents like this, where cryptocurrency is linked to terrorism financing, can fuel skepticism about the legitimacy of digital assets and strengthen calls for stricter regulation. It is crucial for the crypto industry to proactively address these concerns and demonstrate its commitment to compliance and responsible use. Increased Regulatory Pressure: Expect to see increased regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency industry globally. Governments will likely push for more stringent KYC/AML requirements, enhanced transaction monitoring, and greater oversight of crypto exchanges and service providers to prevent illicit activities. Advancements in Crypto Tracing Technology: The success of this crypto seizure will likely spur further investment and innovation in blockchain analytics and crypto tracing technologies. The ability to effectively track and intercept illicit cryptocurrency transactions is becoming increasingly vital for law enforcement and national security. Heightened Awareness of Terrorism Financing Risks: This case serves as a stark reminder of the evolving tactics used by terrorist organizations to finance their operations. It highlights the need for continuous vigilance and adaptation in strategies to counter terrorism financing, particularly in the digital realm. Actionable Insights: What Can Be Learned? For individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency, this event provides several actionable insights: Prioritize Security and Compliance: For cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, robust security measures and strict adherence to KYC/AML regulations are paramount. Proactive compliance can help prevent the misuse of platforms for illicit activities and build trust with regulators and users. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is constantly evolving. Individuals and businesses need to stay informed about new regulations and adapt their practices accordingly to remain compliant. Support Responsible Crypto Use: The cryptocurrency community has a responsibility to promote the responsible use of digital assets and actively combat illicit activities. This includes supporting initiatives that enhance transparency, improve security, and foster collaboration with law enforcement. Understand the Risks: Users of cryptocurrency should be aware of the potential risks associated with illicit activities and take precautions to protect themselves from scams and involvement in illegal transactions. Conclusion: A Warning Shot for Illicit Crypto Use The U.S. DoJ’s crypto seizure from a Hamas-linked wallet is more than just a confiscation of funds; it’s a powerful statement. It demonstrates the resolve and increasing capability of law enforcement to track and disrupt illicit financial activities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This operation serves as a clear warning to those who seek to exploit digital assets for illegal purposes, including terrorism financing and crypto laundering. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so too will the scrutiny and efforts to ensure its responsible and legitimate use. The future of cryptocurrency hinges on its ability to operate within a framework of transparency, security, and compliance, and this crypto seizure is a significant step in that direction.

Recently, pseudonymous Bitcoin market analyst Plan B ignited a fresh wave of speculation by suggesting that Bitcoin is not just valuable, but profoundly undervalued when stacked against traditional titans like gold and real estate. For those navigating the crypto landscape, Plan B’s insights offer a compelling narrative, hinting at a potentially significant upside for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Let’s dive deep into this intriguing analysis and unpack what it means for the future of digital gold. Is Bitcoin Really Undervalued? Plan B Thinks So Plan B, a well-known figure in the crypto sphere for his stock-to-flow (S2F) model, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his perspective on Bitcoin’s current market position. His core argument is simple yet powerful: Bitcoin’s market capitalization and scarcity metrics point towards a substantial undervaluation relative to gold and real estate. But what exactly does this mean, and how does he arrive at this conclusion? According to Plan B’s analysis, the numbers speak volumes: Bitcoin’s Market Cap: Currently hovering around $2 trillion. Gold’s Market Cap: A staggering $20 trillion. This ten-fold difference in market capitalization is the first red flag for Plan B. He argues that considering Bitcoin’s growing adoption, technological advancements, and its inherent scarcity, this valuation gap is simply too wide. But the comparison doesn’t stop at market cap. Plan B delves into another crucial metric: scarcity. Scarcity Showdown: Bitcoin vs. Gold Scarcity is a fundamental principle driving value in both traditional commodities like gold and digital assets like Bitcoin. Plan B highlights the concept of “stock-to-flow” ratio to illustrate this point. Stock-to-flow essentially measures the relationship between the existing supply of an asset (stock) and the rate at which new supply is produced (flow). A higher stock-to-flow ratio generally indicates greater scarcity and, theoretically, greater value retention over time. Let’s break down the stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin and gold as presented by Plan B: Bitcoin’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Approximately 120 years. Gold’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio: Around 60 years. Intriguingly, Bitcoin boasts a stock-to-flow ratio twice that of gold. This implies that Bitcoin is inherently scarcer than gold, at least based on this metric. Plan B posits that this superior scarcity should logically translate to a higher, or at least comparable, valuation. The fact that Bitcoin’s market cap is only a fraction of gold’s, despite its greater scarcity, further strengthens his argument for Bitcoin being undervalued . Real Estate Enters the Valuation Equation While gold is a traditional safe-haven asset often compared to Bitcoin, Plan B also brings real estate into the conversation. The global real estate market dwarfs both gold and Bitcoin in terms of total value. Estimates vary, but the global real estate market is often cited as being several times larger than the gold market, easily exceeding $200 trillion. Why include real estate in this comparison? Plan B’s rationale likely stems from the fact that real estate, like gold, is considered a store of value and a hedge against inflation. However, unlike Bitcoin, real estate is not inherently scarce and is significantly less divisible and portable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers digital scarcity, ease of transfer, and global accessibility. Considering the vastness of the real estate market, Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap appears even smaller in perspective. While real estate serves different purposes and has unique utility, the comparison highlights the immense potential upside if Bitcoin continues to gain traction as a global store of value. What Makes Bitcoin Potentially Undervalued? Beyond market cap and stock-to-flow, several factors contribute to the narrative of Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation: Growing Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even nation-states are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This institutional influx brings significant capital and validation to the Bitcoin market. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. This hard cap ensures digital scarcity, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and robust blockchain technology offer security and censorship resistance, appealing to individuals and entities seeking alternatives to traditional financial systems. Network Effects: As more people adopt and use Bitcoin, its network effect strengthens, further enhancing its value and utility. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments like the Lightning Network and Taproot upgrades are improving Bitcoin’s scalability, privacy, and functionality. These factors collectively paint a picture of a maturing asset with strong fundamentals and growing adoption. If Plan B’s analysis is accurate, and Bitcoin is indeed undervalued , then the current price levels could represent a significant buying opportunity for long-term investors. Challenges and Counterarguments to Bitcoin’s Undervaluation While Plan B’s perspective is compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the counterarguments and challenges to the idea that Bitcoin is fundamentally undervalued: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Price swings can be dramatic and unpredictable, deterring some investors and raising concerns about its stability as a store of value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Unfavorable regulations in major economies could negatively impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Competition from Other Cryptocurrencies: The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with new projects and technologies emerging. Bitcoin faces competition from other cryptocurrencies that may offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, or different functionalities. Energy Consumption Concerns: Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is energy-intensive, raising environmental concerns and attracting criticism. While solutions like the Lightning Network and layer-2 scaling aim to address this, it remains a valid concern for some. Market Sentiment and Speculation: Cryptocurrency markets are heavily influenced by market sentiment and speculation. Price movements can be driven by hype and fear, rather than solely by fundamental value. These challenges highlight the inherent risks associated with investing in Bitcoin and underscore the importance of conducting thorough research and understanding the complexities of the cryptocurrency market. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Undervalued Bitcoin Narrative So, what are the actionable takeaways from Plan B’s analysis and the broader discussion about Bitcoin’s potential undervaluation? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Plan B’s analysis is a valuable perspective, but it’s crucial to conduct your own independent research. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, economics, and market dynamics. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin may present a compelling investment opportunity, diversification is key to managing risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin alongside other asset classes. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Its volatility means short-term price fluctuations are inevitable. Focus on the long-term potential and avoid being swayed by short-term market noise. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and it’s essential to manage your risk appropriately. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Undervalued Potential – A Smart Investment? Plan B’s assertion that Bitcoin is undervalued compared to gold and real estate offers a thought-provoking perspective on the current cryptocurrency landscape. By highlighting the market cap disparity and superior stock-to-flow ratio, he presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s untapped potential. While challenges and risks remain, the fundamental arguments for Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition – scarcity, decentralization, growing adoption – are undeniable. Whether Bitcoin will ultimately reach the market capitalization levels of gold or real estate remains to be seen, but Plan B’s analysis certainly provides a strong incentive for investors to take a closer look and consider the smart investment opportunity that Bitcoin might represent.

Over the past 30 days, traders have deployed nearly $400 million in short-leveraged positions, preventing XRP from breaking key resistance levels. How will XRP price react in April 2025? Ripple (XRP) Stagnates at $2.35 as Traders Remain Reluctant to Sell Ripple (XRP) has delivered notable gains over the past week, largely driven by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision to drop charges against Ripple. Many market participants expected a sharp correction following the 10% rally on Monday, assuming large investors would trigger a “sell-the-news” event. However, sustained bullish sentiment, coupled with fresh volatility from Trump’s 25% auto tariff announcement, has helped XRP maintain stability. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis | March 27 | Source: Coinmarketcap Market data from CoinMarketCap indicates that Ripple price briefly dipped to $2.30 before rebounding to $2.35 at press time. This intraday recovery suggests strong buying support at current levels. $244 Million XRP Short Leverage Cluster Emerges at $2.60 as Bears Look to Avert $3 Breakout While spot market sentiment has remained optimistic, XRP derivatives data signal stiff resistance clusters that could impede further price gains. Coinglass liquidation data highlights a notable discrepancy between short and long leverage positions. Over the past 30 days, bears have placed $404 million in short-leveraged positions—30% more than the $283 million in active long positions. The most significant concentration of these short positions, totalling $244 million, is clustered around the $2.60 level. Ripple (XRP) 30-day Liquidation Map, March 27 | Coinglass This high volume of short positions at $2.60 may explain why XRP has struggled to breach this resistance level, despite strong fundamental catalysts such as the SEC dropping its case against Ripple. Whenever XRP price approaches $2.60, an influx of sell orders from leveraged short positions forces a retracement, effectively capping bullish momentum. Until short positions are liquidated or bulls muster enough demand to absorb selling pressure, XRP may continue to face strong resistance at $2.60, delaying a potential breakout toward $3. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls Struggle as XRP Faces Key Resistance at $2.40, Eyes $2.00 Support XRP price remains under pressure, trading at $2.35, as it struggles to reclaim key resistance levels. The daily chart presents mixed signals, with the 50-day SMA at $2.52 acting as a key barrier to the upside, while support at $2.00 remains a critical level for bulls to defend. The declining MACD histogram suggests waning bullish momentum, as the MACD line flattens near the zero mark. This signals that buying pressure is fading, leaving room for potential downside movement. XRP Price Forecast The Parabolic SAR dots above the current price indicate a bearish trend, reinforcing the likelihood of further selling pressure. Additionally, declining volume confirms the lack of strong bullish conviction. However, if XRP reclaims $2.40 and closes above the 50-day SMA, it could spark renewed bullish momentum, targeting $2.60. Failure to hold above $2.30 could expose XRP to further declines, with bears eyeing the $2.00 psychological level as the next support. A decisive move below $2.00 would confirm a bearish breakdown, opening the door for further losses toward $1.76.

The latest report, titled “Interest Rates, the S&P 500, and Bitcoin: Lessons from the Past and Expectations in 2025,” examines historical market reactions to the Fed’s policy changes and offers important insights for investors navigating the current economic environment. Dot-Com Bubble (2000-2002): Fed rate hikes contributed to the bursting of the tech bubble, causing the S&P 500 to fall by nearly 50% as overvalued companies collapsed. Subprime Crisis (2007-2009): The S&P 500 fell nearly 57% as the Fed raised interest rates to combat inflation and excessive credit, triggering a global financial crisis. COVID-19 Crash and Recovery (2020): The Fed’s emergency rate cuts and liquidity injections initially led to a sharp 35% decline in the S&P 500, followed by a rapid recovery. Bitcoin has been volatile, but has ultimately benefited from the low-interest environment, strengthening its appeal as an alternative asset. Current Cycle (2022-2025): Divergence in Market Behavior Since 2022, the Fed has aggressively raised interest rates from near-zero to 5.5% to counter post-pandemic inflation. Unlike previous crises, the S&P 500 has remained resilient, reaching new highs in 2024-2025. Alphractal attributes this to the following reasons: Lower corporate leverage compared to 2008. Strong performance from AI and technology giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft. Expectations of gradual interest rate cuts are fueling investor optimism. However, the divergence between interest rates and stock market performance is a major concern, according to the analyst firm. Historically, such a breakout has been preceded by high volatility. Bitcoin's historical performance reveals a strong correlation with liquidity conditions: 2010-2021 (Low Interest Rate Era): Bitcoin rose from mere cents to $69,000 in 2021. 2022 Rate Hikes: BTC experienced a sharp correction and dropped to around $16,000. 2024-2025 Stabilization: Bitcoin has regained strength as interest rates have fallen slightly, consolidating its role as a hedge against expansionary monetary policy and inflation. What Happens to Bitcoin If the Fed Cuts Interest Rates? According to Alphractal, the impact of future rate cuts will depend on their nature: Emergency Cuts (Symptom of Crisis): If the Fed is forced to cut rates due to a major economic shock (similar to 2008 or 2020), initial market reactions may be bearish, with both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin experiencing sharp declines. Preemptive Cuts (Soft Landing): Gradual interest rate cuts, as seen in 1995-1996 and 2019, can support market growth, benefiting both stocks and digital assets. Market Scenarios 2025: Alphractal's Forecasts Alphractal outlines three possible scenarios for 2025: Gradual Rate Cuts: If the Fed cuts interest rates in a controlled manner without triggering a recession, the S&P 500 could maintain its upward momentum and Bitcoin could benefit from increased liquidity. External Shock: A new crisis such as geopolitical instability, banking collapse or another pandemic could cause a sharp decline in the market despite interest rate cuts. Persistently High Interest Rates: If inflation remains stubborn and the Fed maintains or raises interest rates, a severe market correction similar to 2000 or 2008 could ensue. *This is not investment advice.

The fourth-quarter GDP numbers “demonstrate that the economy is heading into this year with great momentum and profitability and is resilient to some level of policy uncertainty,” Wells Fargo economists Shannon Grein and Tim Quinlan said. But they fretted over how businesses would respond if trade conditions changed and uncertainty over where the economy is headed. That level of profitability is far above historical averages, which suggests that companies may be able to swallow persistent cost increases rather than pass them on to consumers. That could help keep inflation under control even as trade policies change. Consumer spending slows as businesses stock up Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the economy, increased at a revised 4% pace in the fourth quarter, a bit below prior estimates. And businesses raced to import goods ahead of anticipated tariffs, which helped fuel a jump in imports. The trade gap stayed elevated in February but shrank slightly from a record in January. Some economists caution that this surge of imports will lead to a slowdown in GDP growth in early 2025. Another key economic measure, gross domestic income (GDI), rose 4.5% in the fourth quarter from 1.4% in the third quarter. While GDP measures how much people and businesses spend on goods and services, GDI measures the income earned and the costs involved in producing them. Those two measures grew 3.5% on average last quarter, the fastest pace in a year. A report on Thursday showed that new unemployment claims held steady at 224,000 last week, meaning that the number of people applying for jobless benefits changed a bit. Uncertain trade policies shape 2025 economic outlook Economic growth was robust in the fourth quarter of 2024 but is expected to slow in the months ahead. Most economists are cautious about the future, pointing to shifting trade policies and business uncertainty. Even two of the most powerful investment banks in the world, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have already cut back their forecasts, citing the uncertain global trade environment as a potential drag on economic growth. In an age of surging tariffs, new trade deals, and the potential creation of additional policies, businesses are increasingly reluctant to invest and expand as they work through the unclear swamps of an uncertain market environment. These concerns have led to an update of the Federal Reserveʼs economic outlook and a recognition of the risks to growth. Some economists now expect G.D.P. to reduce in the first three months of 2025 as businesses and consumers dial back spending in the face of an uncertain economic outlook. A rise in imports in the early months of the year, partly propelled by companies stockpiling goods ahead of new tariffs, could also depress growth. If companies cut back on production or lower spending because of higher costs, that could slash more water on economic activity.

42501265,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144063,1743117638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Lightning-Fast Crypto Trading: Jupiter DEX Unleashes Signless Transactions on Solana,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jupiter-dex-signless-solana/,"Are you tired of slow crypto transactions and hefty fees slowing down your trading game? In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), every second counts, and every penny saved is a penny earned. For Solana enthusiasts and high-frequency traders, the wait for a game-changing solution is finally over! Jupiter, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana, has just dropped a bombshell update that promises to redefine trading speed and efficiency. Get ready to experience the future of DeFi trading with Jupiter DEX ‘s revolutionary new feature: Quick Accounts. What are Solana Signless Transactions and Why Should You Care? Imagine executing trades on the Solana blockchain without the constant need to manually sign each transaction with your wallet. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, dream no more! Solana signless transactions are now a reality thanks to Jupiter’s innovative Quick Accounts. This groundbreaking feature leverages embedded wallets to enable a smoother, faster, and significantly cheaper trading experience. But what exactly are signless transactions, and why are they such a big deal? In traditional blockchain transactions, every action, whether it’s swapping tokens, providing liquidity, or interacting with a smart contract, requires a digital signature from your wallet. This process, while crucial for security, can introduce delays and add to transaction costs. Signless transactions, on the other hand, streamline this process by utilizing embedded wallets that handle transaction signing behind the scenes, offering a near-instantaneous trading experience. Think of it as autopilot for your crypto trades! Here’s a simple breakdown: Traditional Transactions: User initiates transaction -> Wallet prompts for signature -> User signs -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Signless Transactions (with Jupiter Quick Accounts): User initiates transaction -> Embedded wallet signs automatically -> Transaction broadcasted -> Transaction processed. Unpacking Jupiter’s Embedded Wallets and Quick Accounts At the heart of this innovation are embedded wallets . Jupiter’s Quick Accounts are essentially smart contract-based wallets that are seamlessly integrated into the Jupiter DEX platform. These wallets are designed to manage transaction signing automatically, eliminating the need for manual wallet interactions for every trade. This integration is not just about speed; it’s about creating a more user-friendly and efficient trading environment, especially crucial for those engaged in rapid-fire trading strategies. Let’s delve deeper into the key aspects of Jupiter Quick Accounts: Speed Boost: By automating the signing process, Quick Accounts drastically reduce transaction times. This is a game-changer for traders who need to react quickly to market fluctuations. Reduced Fees: Faster transactions often translate to lower gas fees on the Solana network, making trading more cost-effective, particularly for high-volume traders. Lower DeFi transaction fees mean more profit in your pocket. Enhanced User Experience: Say goodbye to constant wallet pop-ups and signature requests. Quick Accounts offer a streamlined, almost centralized exchange-like trading experience within the decentralized realm. Security Considerations: While signless transactions offer convenience, security remains paramount. Jupiter has implemented robust security measures for Quick Accounts, but users should always exercise caution and understand the security implications of using embedded wallets. Always do your own research (DYOR) and manage your risk accordingly. The Tremendous Benefits of Crypto Trading Speed for Solana Users Why is crypto trading speed so critical, especially on a blockchain like Solana, known for its high throughput? The answer lies in the nature of crypto markets – they are volatile, dynamic, and move at lightning speed. Faster transaction execution can mean the difference between a profitable trade and a missed opportunity. For Solana users, Jupiter’s Quick Accounts unlock a new level of trading agility. Consider these advantages: Benefit Description Impact on Traders Faster Order Execution Signless transactions minimize delays in processing trades. Capture fleeting market opportunities, execute trades at desired prices more consistently. Reduced Slippage Quicker trades mean less time for price to move against you before your order is filled. Minimize losses due to unfavorable price changes during transaction processing. Improved Arbitrage Opportunities Speed is paramount in arbitrage trading. Signless transactions provide the edge needed to capitalize on price differences across exchanges. Unlock more arbitrage opportunities and increase profitability from arbitrage strategies. Better Performance for Algorithmic Trading Algorithmic trading bots rely on speed and efficiency. Quick Accounts enhance the performance of automated trading strategies on Jupiter. Optimize algorithmic trading strategies for maximum efficiency and profitability. Addressing Potential Challenges and Security Aspects While the advantages are clear, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges. Any new technology comes with learning curves and considerations. For embedded wallets and signless transactions, users should be mindful of: Security Practices: Understanding the security framework of embedded wallets is crucial. Users need to trust the platform and ensure they are following best practices for account security. Smart Contract Risks: Quick Accounts rely on smart contracts. While audited, smart contracts are not immune to vulnerabilities. Users should be aware of smart contract risks associated with DeFi platforms. Custodial Aspects: While presented as non-custodial in the sense that you retain control over your funds within the smart contract, embedded wallets introduce a different custodial model compared to traditional self-custody. Understanding this nuance is key. Platform Dependency: Reliance on Jupiter’s infrastructure is inherent when using Quick Accounts. Users should consider the platform’s reliability and reputation. Jupiter has emphasized security in the development of Quick Accounts. However, as with any DeFi innovation, users are encouraged to exercise caution, educate themselves thoroughly, and only use services they fully understand and trust. Actionable Insights: Getting Started with Jupiter Quick Accounts Ready to dive into the world of signless transactions on Jupiter? Here’s a quick guide to get you started: Visit Jupiter DEX: Head over to the Jupiter DEX platform . Connect Your Wallet: Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) to the platform. Explore Quick Accounts: Look for the Quick Accounts feature within the Jupiter interface (likely under account settings or trading preferences). Enable Quick Accounts: Follow the prompts to set up and enable Quick Accounts. This might involve creating a new embedded wallet or linking an existing one. Start Trading: Once enabled, you can start experiencing the speed and efficiency of signless transactions. Monitor and Manage: Keep an eye on your Quick Accounts and transactions. Familiarize yourself with the platform’s security features and best practices. Jupiter’s Quick Accounts represent a significant leap forward in making DeFi trading more accessible and efficient. By embracing Solana signless transactions and embedded wallets, Jupiter is not just enhancing its platform; it’s contributing to the evolution of the entire DeFi ecosystem. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of DeFi Trading Jupiter’s introduction of Quick Accounts is more than just an update; it’s a bold step towards the future of DeFi trading. By tackling the challenges of transaction speed and fees head-on, Jupiter is paving the way for a more seamless, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized trading experience. The era of lightning-fast crypto trading on Solana is here, and Jupiter DEX is leading the charge.

Bitcoin Faces Pressure After Massive Long Position Wipeout,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/are-the-bulls-still-in-control-bitcoin-faces-pressure-after-massive-long-position-wipeout/,"Bitcoin continues to show signs of price consolidation, with its value hovering just below the $87,000 mark. As of today, BTC is trading at approximately $86,990, reflecting a 0.8% decline over the past 24 hours. Despite the slight dip, the broader picture shows that Bitcoin has stabilized above $85,000 for several consecutive sessions, signaling a pause in the strong upward or downward momentum observed in previous weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Above $86K as On-Chain Data Points to ‘Bullish Shift’ Long Liquidation Indication For The Market While volatility appears subdued, market dynamics remain active behind the scenes. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently provided insights into Bitcoin’s latest market structure, highlighting a key development: the liquidation of $359.7 million worth of long positions. This event has drawn attention to potential shifts in sentiment and important technical levels that may act as support or resistance in the short term. According to Taha, a long liquidation occurs when traders holding leveraged long positions are forced to close their trades after the price drops below their margin thresholds. When this happens at scale, as seen recently, it reflects a sudden change in sentiment and often forces short-term sell-offs. However, Taha points out that such events can also set the stage for a potential market rebound, as many overleveraged positions are cleared, giving space for new demand to emerge. Liquidation event of $359.7M in long positions “If BTC holds above the short-term realized price, it suggests strength in demand. A breakdown below these levels might indicate a potential reversal or correction.” – By Amr Taha Full post ⤵️https://t.co/SW9e16kofW pic.twitter.com/0YR9rfreGa — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Bitcoin UTXO Metrics Paint a Mixed Picture Complementing this observation is Bitcoin’s realized price distribution by UTXO age bands. Taha notes that Bitcoin’s current market price remains above the realized price for UTXOs aged 1 day to 1 week, indicating that recent buyers are holding unrealized profits. Meanwhile, UTXOs in the 1-week to 1-month range have their realized price near $84,740—a level that could act as technical support if Bitcoin dips in the near term. This confluence of short-term holder profitability and support near $84K may serve as an important signal. If Bitcoin maintains its position above these realized price zones, it suggests continued strength from recent buyers. However, if the price begins to fall below these thresholds, it could point to increased selling pressure or a broader correction phase.

As key breakout levels loom, market watchers are buzzing with curiosity. Will these assets surge to new heights, or falter under pressure? Discover the exciting potential and hidden opportunities within the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency. Worldcoin: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Pressure The past month Worldcoin experienced a 7.39% decline paired with a 9.10% weekly rebound, indicating volatile price swings. Over the past six months, the coin has dropped sharply by 53.76%, reflecting a significant bearish trend amid persistent downward pressure. The price actions reveal a market that struggled to maintain momentum over a longer cycle while showing glimpses of recovery in the short run. These changes outline a history marked by rapid declines along with sporadic rallies that indicate the coin’s reactive nature in bearish market conditions. The coin currently trades between $0.78 and $1.62, with a key resistance level set at $2.14 and strong support around $0.46. Technical measures suggest balanced activity between bulls and bears, with no decisive trend direction. Traders could consider buying near support and taking profits as resistance nears, keeping a close eye on market fluctuations. GALA Price Trends and Key Trading Levels GALA showed a mild recovery over the past month, gaining approximately 5% with a monthly increase around 5.5%. However, it has experienced a six-month decline of nearly 21%, indicating ongoing downward pressure despite recent short-term strength. The price action has fluctuated, with various upswings from a low range. Overall, sentiment among traders appears cautious as they assess the market's direction. Current price is between $0.0129 and $0.0293, with resistance around $0.0392 and support at $0.0065. Bulls are currently testing the resistance levels while bears exert pressure, leading to a lack of a clear trend. Traders might consider entering positions near support and monitoring for a breakout above resistance, which could signal potential upward momentum. Conclusion WLD and GALA are nearing critical breakout points. Such levels suggest a potential for upward movement. If the breakout is confirmed, investors might see significant gains. Monitoring these levels closely will be essential to capitalize on the possible price surge. While the immediate future looks promising, only time will reveal if these cryptocurrencies can maintain their momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) platform Hyperliquid has just announced a significant expansion to its offerings. Get ready to dive into the world of ETH trading as deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading for Ether (ETH) are now officially live on Hyperliquid. This development marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the wider crypto community, opening up new avenues for traders and investors alike. Let’s explore what this exciting launch means for you. Why is ETH Trading on Hyperliquid a Game Changer? The introduction of ETH trading on Hyperliquid isn’t just another listing; it’s a strategic move that brings numerous benefits to users. Hyperliquid has quickly gained attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space for its innovative approach and robust infrastructure. Adding ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, to its trading roster significantly enhances the platform’s appeal and utility. But what exactly makes this launch so impactful? Expanded Trading Opportunities: With ETH trading now available, Hyperliquid users have access to a wider range of trading pairs and opportunities. Ethereum is a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, and its availability on Hyperliquid provides traders with more flexibility and portfolio diversification options. Enhanced Liquidity: Listing ETH typically attracts more users and trading volume, leading to increased liquidity on the platform. Higher liquidity translates to tighter spreads, faster order execution, and reduced slippage, all of which are crucial for efficient crypto spot trading . Platform Growth: The addition of ETH can be seen as a sign of Hyperliquid’s growth and maturity. It demonstrates the platform’s commitment to expanding its offerings and becoming a comprehensive hub for decentralized trading. Access to DeFi Ecosystem: Ethereum is the backbone of a vast DeFi ecosystem. By facilitating Ethereum trading , Hyperliquid is further integrating itself into this ecosystem, potentially unlocking future integrations and opportunities for its users. Navigating the World of Decentralized Exchange ETH Trading on Hyperliquid For those new to decentralized exchanges or Hyperliquid itself, understanding the basics is essential before diving into ETH trading . Decentralized exchanges differ significantly from centralized exchanges in their operational model and ethos. Here’s a quick rundown: Feature Decentralized Exchange (DEX) – Hyperliquid Centralized Exchange (CEX) Custody of Funds Users retain control of their private keys and funds. Users deposit funds, and the exchange controls custody. Transparency Transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, offering high transparency. Transactions are often less transparent, with order books and execution details sometimes opaque. Security Relies on smart contracts and blockchain security; reduces single point of failure risks. Vulnerable to centralized points of failure and hacking of exchange infrastructure. Regulation Operates with less regulatory oversight, though this landscape is evolving. Subject to stricter regulatory compliance and KYC/AML procedures. Accessibility Potentially more accessible globally, without stringent KYC in some cases. May have geographical restrictions and stricter onboarding processes. Hyperliquid, as a decentralized exchange , embodies these DEX principles, offering users a platform for crypto spot trading where they maintain control over their assets. The launch of ETH trading further enriches this ecosystem. Unlocking the Potential of Crypto Spot Trading with ETH on Hyperliquid Crypto spot trading refers to the immediate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for instant delivery. Unlike futures or margin trading, spot trading involves direct ownership of the asset. With ETH trading now live on Hyperliquid, users can engage in spot trading with Ethereum, leveraging the platform’s decentralized nature and unique features. What are some key benefits of engaging in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid? Direct Ownership: When you engage in crypto spot trading of ETH on Hyperliquid, you directly own the ETH you purchase. This ownership is recorded on the blockchain, giving you full control over your assets. Simplicity: Spot trading is generally simpler to understand compared to more complex trading instruments like derivatives. It’s a straightforward way to buy or sell ETH based on your market analysis and strategy. Decentralized Security: Trading ETH on a decentralized exchange like Hyperliquid enhances security by minimizing counterparty risk. Your funds are not held by a central entity, reducing the risk of exchange hacks or failures. Transparency and Control: DEXs like Hyperliquid offer greater transparency in trading operations. You can often verify transactions on the blockchain, and you retain control over your private keys, empowering you in your trading journey. Navigating Challenges in ETH Trading on a Decentralized Exchange While decentralized exchange ETH trading on platforms like Hyperliquid offers numerous advantages, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Complexity for Beginners: DEXs can sometimes have a steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with concepts like wallet management, gas fees, and blockchain interactions. However, platforms are continually working on improving user experience. Gas Fees: Transactions on Ethereum and many DEXs involve gas fees, which can fluctuate and sometimes be high, especially during periods of network congestion. Understanding and managing gas fees is crucial for cost-effective ETH trading . Smart Contract Risks: While smart contracts enhance security, they are not immune to vulnerabilities. It’s essential to use reputable and audited DEX platforms like Hyperliquid, which prioritize security and smart contract integrity. Liquidity Fragmentation: While Hyperliquid aims to provide robust liquidity, liquidity can sometimes be fragmented across different DEXs compared to centralized exchanges. It’s important to monitor liquidity when engaging in larger trades. Actionable Insights for Getting Started with ETH Trading on Hyperliquid Ready to jump into ETH trading on Hyperliquid? Here are some actionable insights to get you started on the right foot: Set up your Wallet: Ensure you have a compatible Web3 wallet like MetaMask or WalletConnect. Connect your wallet to the Hyperliquid platform. Fund your Account: Deposit ETH or other supported cryptocurrencies into your Hyperliquid account through your connected wallet. Remember to factor in gas fees for transactions. Explore the Platform: Familiarize yourself with the Hyperliquid trading interface. Understand how to navigate the order book, charts, and trading tools. Start Small: If you’re new to DEX trading or Hyperliquid, begin with smaller trades to get comfortable with the platform and processes. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market trends, Hyperliquid platform updates, and security best practices in the DeFi space. Utilize Resources: Hyperliquid likely offers documentation, tutorials, or community support channels. Make use of these resources to enhance your understanding and trading experience.

Elise Stefanik’s nomination as US ambassador to the UN has greatly impacted President Donald Trump’s choice of Cabinet members. Her confirmation had been postponed because of concerns about the narrow House margins for Republicans. Trump confirmed the ruling in a post on Truth Social, saying that they had to keep all of the Republican seats in Congress. GOP scraps Stefanik’s UN nomination to preserve House majority Stefanik was nominated shortly after Trump was reelected in November to represent the United States at the global organization. Although her nomination advanced out of committee in late January, and she was regarded as one of the least controversial Cabinet choices, the House Republicans’ razor-thin majority kept her eventual confirmation in a state of purgatory for the past few months. Stefanik’s nomination appeared to make it to the Senate floor recently, especially since Florida had two U.S. House special elections in districts that Trump won easily in 2024. However, concerns about maintaining the Republican majority ultimately led to the decision to withdraw her from consideration. “We must be unified to accomplish our mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts. As one of my biggest allies, I have asked Elise to remain in Congress,” the president said. He, however, did not specify who he would propose to take her place. On the other hand, Stefanik’s office did not immediately answer a request for comment. Keeping Stefanik in the House would have provided Republicans, who control 218 seats, more flexibility in passing legislation in an increasingly divided Congress. The Democratic caucus holds 213 seats. The GOP also took notice after Democrats won an unexpected victory in a Pennsylvania state Senate special election, flipping a seat in a Republican-leaning district. Stefanik is the fourth Trump administration nominee who did not make it through the confirmation process. Former U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz was withdrawn from consideration for the position of attorney general, Chad Chronister was removed from consideration for the position of Drug Enforcement Administration, and Dr David Weldon, a former congressman from Florida, was removed from consideration for the position of CDR. Trump withdraws Chad Chronister’s DEA nomination amid conservative backlash Trump’s selection for DEA chief, Chad Chronister, also faced confirmation troubles. A couple of months ago, Trump abruptly resigned the sheriff from a Senate confirmation position and removed his name from the list of candidates for the job. Consequently, Chronister shared an X post stating that he had turned down the offer, calling it the honour of a lifetime. Without going into further detail, Chronister wrote, “Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I have concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.” Trump explained on his social media account, Truth Social, that Chronister resigned suddenly because he did not agree with what the sheriff had told his pastors and other supporters. Some conservatives criticized Chronister for his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic and for claiming that his office was not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Deep altcoin dips could spark a reevaluation of risk, prompting a realignment of strategies. Investors might soon favor assets with stable fundamentals and robust network support. The top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization lost a combined $659 billion between January and March 2025, according to a Thursday report by CryptoQuant . Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) took the hardest hits during the downturn, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) showed more stable performance. XRP, which saw a surge earlier in the cycle, failed to maintain its gains. CryptoQuant: BTC and BNB Withstand Market Pressure CryptoQuant’s analysis showed that BTC and BNB weathered the market drop better than their peers. Each asset declined by around 20% from its most recent all-time high, marking a milder correction compared to the rest of the top five. BNB’s stability is particularly notable, as it has maintained a consistently shallow drawdown range throughout the observed period. This resilience is partly driven by practical utility across the Binance ecosystem, all of which require users to actively hold BNB. ETH and SOL… pic.twitter.com/9d6CagU2jY — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Their relative strength stood in contrast to the sharp pullbacks seen in Ethereum and Solana, both of which saw more severe losses. XRP, despite a market cap rally following the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, also slipped behind in recent weeks. ETH/BTC Ratio Fell 72% Since September 2022, CryptoQuant Data Shows Another key metric highlighted in the report is Ethereum’s falling value relative to Bitcoin. Since September 2022, the ETH/BTC ratio has dropped by 72%, reaching its lowest level since January 2020. Historically, such dips have sometimes preceded a reversal, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure against Bitcoin. Mixed Signals from XRP Performance XRP experienced a sharp rise in market capitalization following regulatory optimism in late 2024. Its valuation jumped from $30 billion in early November to $141 billion by March 2025. This growth was supported by increased activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), where active addresses spiked from 15,000 to 109,000. However, that momentum has since faded. As of now, daily active addresses have settled between 20,000 and 40,000, based on CryptoQuant’s latest data. The report paints a clear picture of how leading digital assets are moving in different directions. While Bitcoin and BNB have held their ground more effectively, ETH, SOL, and XRP have struggled to keep pace. CryptoQuant’s findings underscore the uneven impact of the current market correction and suggest that the next few months could be key in determining whether these trends deepen or reverse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What might this divergence mean for crypto’s long-term structure? The split may drive a reallocation of capital toward coins that deliver steady network metrics and lower volatility, potentially redefining market norms and investment strategies. How could these corrections influence risk management in crypto portfolios? Investors might adopt more disciplined approaches by diversifying holdings and emphasizing assets with proven fundamentals, leading to a strategic reassessment of exposure and risk tolerance. Which emerging trends could gain favor as portfolios are rebalanced? Expect growing interest in projects that blend strong network effects with scalable, low-cost solutions, attracting long-term capital and sparking renewed innovation in blockchain protocols.

The bloc’s decision comes after Washington slapped a 25 percent tariff on the car industry and hinted at further measures next week. One EU diplomat told FT, “The Americans think that they are the ones with escalation dominance [in the trade war], but we also have the ability to do that,” stressing that the ultimate goal is to de-escalate tensions and reach a comprehensive trade deal. Officials believe that by targeting services where the US shows vulnerability, they can force Washington to come to the negotiating table. Brussels had already responded by imposing extra duties on up to €26 billion of US goods following tariffs on steel and aluminum. However, European officials say the scale of the Trump administration’s actions has forced the EU to consider using even more powerful trade tools. The EU’s legal framework targets intellectual property and contracts Under its Enforcement Regulation, strengthened in 2021 after an earlier trade dispute, the EU has the power to suspend intellectual property rights and exclude companies from public procurement contracts. A potential fightback might involve restrictions on the intellectual property rights of major tech companies. This could include a ban on Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network from winning government contracts. In fact, Italy is already rethinking its plans to acquire the system. “Services is where the US is vulnerable,” said a second diplomat. Moreover, Washington ran a €109 billion trade surplus with the EU in services in 2023, compared with a €157 billion deficit in goods. Economic risks and negotiation challenges loom ahead While some European diplomats are optimistic about reaching a deal quickly, they acknowledge that such an agreement would not automatically remove all the extra tariffs imposed by the US. “The view is that we have to respond. It is the only way to get a deal,” said a third EU diplomat, adding that previous attempts to talk had failed. Since the EU’s exports far outstrip its imports, the bloc would find it difficult to match the US tariffs on goods. Moreover, Brussels does not want to risk cutting off gas supplies from the United States, which are vital to the continent’s energy needs. “There are only so many goods imports from the US that the EU can target before that damages the economy too much,” explained David Henig from the European Centre for International Political Economy. “If you don’t want to target energy, there’s a limit to what can be done on goods. Whereas on services there is greater room for retaliation without so much harm to the economy.” Some experts argue that the EU might need to use its anti-coercion instrument, the “trade bazooka,” to inflict even more economic pain on the US. This tool could allow the European Commission to restrict activities by US banks, revoke patents, or prevent companies from receiving revenues from software updates or streaming. “I would advise the European Commission to use the ACI,” said Ignacio García Berrero, a former senior commission official who led negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a deal that was never finalized. Any retaliatory measures would be drafted by the European Commission but must gain the approval of a weighted majority of member states. EU countries are still negotiating the goods retaliation list that was drawn up in response to Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. For example, France has pressed for bourbon whiskey to be removed from the list to protect its own drinks industry. The commission has postponed measures covering jeans, motorcycles, and possibly soyabeans until April 12. These measures will be discussed with national leaders before a final decision is made. Diplomats and officials also noted that more tariffs on googs could be on the table in response to any US reciprocal tariffs expected from the White House next week . Brussels estimates these tariffs could be around 20 percent and might hit aircraft, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products.

It was a calculated attempt to put an end to the industry,” Marszalek said in a March 27 X post. ”The fact that we not only persevered but became stronger is a testament to our vision and the community supporting it. Onwards!” It comes seven months after the SEC issued a Wells notice to the crypto platform in August, signaling its intention to take legal action against the firm. We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com,” added Crypto.com’s chief legal officer Nick Lundgren in a March 27 statement, which accused the previous administration of abusing its authority to harm the crypto industry. Source: Kris Marszalek Crypto.com had filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October, two months after the Wells notice, accusing the Gary Gensler-led commission of overstepping its authority and taking a “misguided” approach to crypto regulation. SEC continues to roll back previous enforcement actions Crypto.com’s announcement follows a wave of other crypto investigations and lawsuits dropped by the SEC over the last five weeks, which affected the likes of Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap, OpenSea and more recently, Immutable. The SEC also dismissed its civil enforcement action against crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW with prejudice on March 27. Related: Ripple will drop cross-appeal in SEC case, get refund from lower court ruling The SEC has adopted a far friendlier approach since Mark Uyeda started leading the commission as acting chair on Jan. 20 after the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler.

It also canceled a controversial rule that asked financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets on Jan. 23.

Ethereum Supply Drops & ADA Awaits Breakout,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/blockdags-path-to-1-gains-clarity-after-recent-ama-ethereum-supply-drops-ada-awaits-breakout/,"Ethereum supply on exchanges has fallen to a level not seen in nearly ten years, yet price action remains lackluster, sparking renewed discussions in the ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) also sits in a cautious zone, with its next movement depending on a critical technical breakout. In contrast to these slow-moving scenarios, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gathering strong traction. Its recent AMA revealed detailed plans for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) along with a rollout to 10 major exchanges. As a result, analysts now expect BDAG to potentially reach $1 by 2025—positioning it among the best crypto to buy right now. Ethereum Market Shows Mixed Signals as Exchange Supply Declines The ongoing Ethereum (ETH) market analysis points out that ETH holdings on centralised exchanges have reached the lowest point since 2015, hinting at a growing trend toward holding and staking. With just 8.97 million ETH remaining on exchanges, Santiment data indicates a 16.4% decrease over the past seven weeks. Still, ETH’s value has dropped nearly 47% from its peak last December. Technical signals remain weak, with Ethereum struggling to clear major resistance zones. Slower fee revenue, lower DeFi usage on the mainnet, and increasing competition from layer-2 platforms have all contributed to a blurry short-term picture for Ethereum. Cardano Price Prediction Depends on Crucial Breakout Zones Current Cardano (ADA) price prediction sees limited clarity as ADA trades near $0.72, falling 2% in the past day. A 25% dip in trading volume also signals decreased trader interest. Analysts note a symmetrical triangle forming, suggesting the next move could decide ADA’s near-term direction. From a technical viewpoint, the Cardano price prediction depends on a breakout. Moving past $0.74 could open the way to $0.83, while slipping under $0.70 could lead ADA toward $0.65. Liquidation zones at $0.71 and $0.73, as shown by on-chain metrics, reflect strong indecision among market players. BlockDAG Eyes $1 Mark as TGE Plans Go Viral in Recent AMA BlockDAG’s latest AMA revealed a full breakdown of what many are calling one of the most well-prepared launches in today’s crypto space. The team outlined specific steps for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), setting the stage for its official market debut. Among the key updates, BDAG will be fully tradable shortly after TGE. Work is already underway to ensure listings on 10 well-known centralised exchanges, including top-tier platforms that could drive stronger volume and attention. This upfront strategy has boosted confidence. Since the announcement, presale activity has surged. BlockDAG has now collected more than $207 million, with over 18.9 billion BDAG coins sold across 27 separate presale rounds. These milestones point to growing belief from the market, as many are eager to grab BDAG before it becomes openly available. This demand continues to push BDAG into the spotlight as the best crypto to buy right now. Outlook for BDAG remains positive. The coin has jumped 2380% already—from $0.001 in early rounds to $0.0248 in the current batch. Forecasts now suggest BDAG could reach $1 in 2025, supported by a clear rollout plan, planned listings, and solid early performance. This places BlockDAG among the top breakout projects under watch before it fully enters the market. Final Take! Ethereum’s reduced exchange supply signals long-term confidence, but weak price action still clouds its outlook, as outlined in the latest Ethereum (ETH) market analysis. Cardano continues to hover in a narrow range, with any breakout likely to shape the short-term Cardano (ADA) price prediction. On the other hand, BlockDAG appears to be entering a new phase of rapid development. With its Token Generation Event strategy clearly outlined and exchange listings in progress, BDAG is building strong momentum. Analysts predict it could hit $1 in 2025, and with its current presale price at $0.0248, BDAG is now widely seen as the best crypto to buy right now.

Lookonchain notes on the social media platform X that the whale spent $5 million worth of Circle’s stablecoin, USDC , to buy TRUMP right after President Donald Trump posted “I LOVE $TRUMP” on his social media platform Truth Social. The whale then sold the TRUMP stash an hour later, booking a $207,000 loss. However, the loss pales in comparison to gains the whale made earlier this year when it spent 1.09 million USDC to buy 5.97 million TRUMP and booked a $108 million profit, according to Lookonchain. The president launched the Official Trump memecoin in mid-January, days before he took office. The asset has generated controversy in and out of crypto circles, raising questions of corruption in an already heavily questioned administration. Even Ethereum ( ETH ) founder Vitalik Buterin said in January that political coins represented “vehicles for unlimited political bribery.” In a February letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Government Ethics, officials at the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen argued TRUMP could be a violation of federal law regulating gifts to government officials.

People are looking beyond flashy price charts. What they really want are the best crypto projects in 2025—ones with strong real-world use, powerful tech, and the chance for real growth. That’s why attention is turning to four key names: BlockDAG, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Each of these coins has its own strengths, and if current trends continue, they could see strong gains soon. BlockDAG: Is This the Next $1 Coin by 2025 with 3932% Growth? BlockDAG (BDAG) ranks high among the best crypto projects in 2025. It runs on a smart system called Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which allows transactions to take place at the same time—no delays or traffic issues. This leads to faster processing and smooth performance, making it a great choice for developers building fast and reliable decentralised apps. In its presale, BlockDAG has brought in more than $207 million. A total of 18.9 billion BDAG coins have already been sold. At batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, and those who joined early have seen a return of 2,380%. Analysts say BDAG might reach $1 in 2025, which would be a 3,932% increase from where it is now. With the mainnet expected later this year and ten confirmed CEX listings in 2025, BlockDAG is seen as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for early access to high returns. XRP: Designed for Fast, Large-Scale Transfers XRP continues to gain ground as a top name in digital payments. The United Nations has mentioned XRP in relation to a possible cashless global system. There is even speculation about Donald Trump possibly including it in a US crypto reserve. Maximilian Staudinger, a well-known analyst, suggested XRP could help unlock $1.5 trillion from Nostro accounts used for cross-border payments. What makes XRP one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is its speed and ease of use. Some believe it may become part of official global reserves, and the interest around this continues to rise. It hasn’t yet broken past $3, but the selling pressure is lower now, with an RSI of 34. In the past 24 hours, XRP moved up 12.4%, now priced at $2.53. It’s showing steady movement, and many are watching to see if it can finally cross that $3 line. Solana (SOL): Potential ETF Launch May Drive 2025 Growth Solana’s strong point is its role as a fast and cheaper option compared to Ethereum. Since its 2020 launch, it has reached a market cap of $65.6 billion. Talks are going on about the SEC allowing spot ETFs for Solana in 2025, which could draw in users from traditional finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum have ETF approvals already, so some believe Solana could be next. Its price has fallen around 50% since its $260 high in January, mostly due to broader market conditions. The RSI is now at 57 and is moving slowly upward, suggesting demand is cooling for now. Still, many see Solana as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 if ETF approval happens and market activity rises again. Cardano (ADA): Focused on Careful Growth and Clear Plans Cardano, with its $25.2 billion market value, is aiming to grow as a serious option alongside Ethereum and Solana. There’s talk that Trump might also include ADA in the US crypto reserve idea. Charles Hoskinson, who co-created Ethereum, started Cardano in 2014 to offer something more stable and well-planned. One reason many view ADA as one of the best crypto projects in 2025 is the team’s open way of working. Right now, ADA is staying around the $0.70 level with resistance at $1 and $1.10. These price levels show a slow but steady path. Its mix of clear growth, stability, and detailed progress has made ADA a strong option to follow. Best Crypto Projects in 2025– Final Remarks! Looking toward 2025, XRP is building a real use case in payments and may benefit from political moves. Solana is waiting for ETF chances, and Cardano keeps improving steadily with on-chain upgrades. However, BlockDAG stands out. With over 2,380% gains already and a price of $0.0248 in batch 27, many believe it could hit $1. A return of 3,932% would make it one of the best crypto projects in 2025 for those aiming for early growth with long-term value. It’s showing clear signs of being ready for the next big move.

The cloud provider sold 37.5 million shares at $40 each. It had initially planned to sell 49 million shares at $47 to $55 each, but a weaker-than-expected stock market posed difficulties for the company. The company initially sought to raise $4 billion at a $35 billion valuation, reporting $1.9 billion in revenue last year but still seeing a net loss of nearly $900 million. AI powerhouse Nvidia, an investor in CoreWeave, is anchoring the IPO with a $250 million order, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. CoreWeave is closely tied to bitcoin miner CoreScientific, which struck a multi-billion deal with the New Jersey-based firm to expand its artificial intelligence capabilities. Nvidia's own stock price is down 12% since the beginning of the year, The Information reported late Thursday, reflecting broader weakness in AI-focused firms.

President Donald Trump appears open to a deal that leaves some involvement for the Chinese company. Lawmakers such as Michigan Republican John Moolenaar have warned that any arrangement giving ByteDance continued control is a grave threat to US security and a violation of American law. At a TikTok Coalition event on Thursday, Moolenaar said, “Any deal that allows ByteDance to maintain control of TikTok is a grave threat to our security and a violation of US law. If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal – plain and simple.” Recent reports indicate that a prospective deal would allow ByteDance to retain a stake in TikTok. Under the proposal, data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle. The move is part of talks led by the White House, centered on a “qualified divestiture.” The law mandates that a foreign adversary must no longer control the app, defined as holding a stake of 20 percent or more, while leaving room for the president to set the terms. President Trump is eager to “save” the app and would go to extra lengths. He has not clearly stated whether he would support ByteDance having a partial role in TikTok. On Wednesday, he said he might lower tariffs on China to secure Beijing’s support and would consider extending the April 5 deadline if no agreement is reached. Trump talks about the TikTok deal at the Oval Office. Source: Bloomberg The law originally set the deadline as January 19 with a one-time 90-day extension for progress, and Trump had extended it on his first day in office after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The forced sale law, passed last year as part of a foreign aid package, was enacted amid concerns that TikTok’s Chinese ownership might allow Beijing to conduct influence operations against the United States. While the law mandates a divestiture, free speech advocates warn that a ban would restrict Americans’ access to foreign media. It would violate the First Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January, maintaining pressure on TikTok to separate from its Chinese owner. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts stated that the US intelligence community had “no information” that ByteDance manipulated TikTok content to favor the Chinese government. On Monday, Markey, along with Senators Cory Booker and Chris Van Hollen, sent a letter urging Trump to work with Congress on a legal basis for any extension. Earlier this year, they and Representative Ro Khanna of California introduced a bill to extend the original January 19 deadline by 270 days. Some Republicans want pure TikTok divestiture Florida Republican Representative Kat Cammack called for “an absolute pure divestiture” on Thursday. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, known as one of the strongest supporters, has yet to firmly take a stand on the need for complete divestiture, with reports indicating he is allowing the White House to handle the negotiations. When asked about President Trump’s recent remarks, Guo Jiakun, spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Beijing has stated its position on TikTok on multiple occasions. He added that China’s opposition to extra tariffs is “consistent and clear.” In January, China’s foreign ministry also expressed openness to a TikTok deal, noting that acquisitions should be “decided independently by companies” according to the law. Some reports have suggested that TikTok’s algorithm may be subject to export controls by China’s commerce ministry. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company’s revised investment policy now permits a portion of its corporate treasury and future borrowings to be invested directly into Bitcoin and stablecoins. Despite declining net sales, GameStop holds significant liquidity, reporting cash reserves of $4.77 billion as of February. This strategic pivot aligns closely with previous Bitcoin adoption moves by firms such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet, both of which have seen notable stock appreciation after similar announcements . An announcement regarding Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gG8JRarIok — GameStop (@gamestop) March 25, 2025 GameStop’s Bitcoin investment further validates the cryptocurrency’s growing appeal among corporate treasuries, potentially attracting broader institutional participation and strengthening Bitcoin’s market position. MicroStrategy’s Growing Bitcoin Ambitions MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy, could accumulate more than one million Bitcoin by 2033—equating to nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply—according to analysts at Bernstein. Currently, the firm owns approximately 506,137 Bitcoin, purchased at an average cost of $66,608.

Bernstein forecasts Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by 2025 and possibly $1 million by 2033, driven by supportive monetary policies and strong capital markets. Under bullish market conditions, Strategy’s holdings could reach 5.8% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Strategy’s continued Bitcoin accumulation underscores institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Nonetheless, short-term volatility persists, with Bitcoin recently trading around $86,982, down 1.33% in the past 24 hours. U.S. Government Accelerates Digital Payment Transition President Donald Trump mandated a complete transition to digital federal payments by September 30, 2025, aiming to eliminate paper-based transactions. The administration expects annual taxpayer savings of approximately $657 million through reduced fraud and administrative costs. #ACH $SHx #Stronghold #NACHA Executive Orders March 25, 2025 Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account – Effective September 30, 2025 Read this: (e) The Secretary of the Treasury shall support agencies’ transition to digital payment methods, including… pic.twitter.com/Fs5dyq5FAb — Cpt. X (@DebunkJelpi) March 27, 2025 The executive order emphasizes electronic fund transfer (EFT) methods, including digital wallets, direct deposits, and debit cards, explicitly ruling out the adoption of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Trump’s administration maintains a clear stance against government-controlled digital currencies. This move toward digital payments may indirectly support increased Bitcoin adoption, as users shift toward decentralized digital assets rather than centralized digital currencies. Bitcoin Price Technical Outlook Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is consolidating near $87,220 within a symmetrical triangle formation on the 2-hour chart. Price action maintains key support at $86,800, reinforced by the 50-period EMA. Immediate resistance at $88,800 limits upside momentum, and a confirmed breakout above this level could target $90,750 and $92,800. On the downside, critical support levels remain at $86,400 and $84,870, with a sustained move below these zones potentially opening the door to $83,200. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral at 51, signaling balanced market sentiment. Traders should monitor volume closely to confirm the next major directional move.

Analyst Says A Weekly Close Above This Level Would Trigger A Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-imminent/,"The crypto market is still trying to recover from its crash in early March, and sentiment is currently fluctuating. Although the Fear & Greed Index is still in the fear zone, the Bitcoin price is now slowly pushing back toward $90,000, which has been slowly changing the sentiment among altcoins. Rekt Capital, an influential analyst on X, reignited hope for an incoming altcoin season with a key technical signal. According to the post, a breakout in the altcoin market cap could soon take shape if one critical condition is met. The analyst shared a chart and commentary suggesting that the next major rally may already be in motion, provided that the altcoin market cap can secure a weekly close above a particular level. Weekly Close Above $250 Billion Could Be The Game Changer The altcoin market cap reached a multi-month low in the first week of March after the crash that saw many cryptocurrencies shell out weeks of price gains within a short period. This crash briefly pushed the altcoin market cap below $200 billion, although it eventually closed the week above this threshold. However, this market cap has steadily been inching upwards in the last two weeks since the crash. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat At the time of writing, the altcoin market cap has risen back to around $249 billion. Technical analysis from crypto analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that a weekly close above the $250 billion mark would mark a significant technical shift for alts. This level, highlighted in blue on the chart below, will be an important resistance level for crypto investors waiting for the altcoin season. The analyst noted that a decisive close above it would likely precede a breakout rally toward the $315 billion level, marked in red. That move wouldn’t just signal short-term bullishness; it would also serve as confirmation that the bottom for altcoins has already been established. However, even if the altcoin market cap were to surge quickly towards $315, there would still be some work to do to return in order to the recent high of $451 billion set in December 2024. Shallow Correction Points To Stronger Momentum Ahead For Altcoin The nature of the current correction from this $451 billion altcoin market cap adds more weight to the possibility of an altcoin rally. According to the analyst, the ongoing correction has only reached a 55% drawdown from its local high, notably shallower than the previous major altcoin bear market retracements of 69% and 85%. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Recent Crypto Dip Shows Decline May Be Over And Bulls Are Taking Charge The shallower decline in the current retracement is interpreted as a sign of growing market maturity among altcoins. This implies that the selling pressure may be waning and that bulls are preparing for a stronger push. It also means that the $425 billion altcoin market cap resistance is weakening as a point of rejection, which in turn increases the chances of a breakout at the next visit.

Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit, Lummis emphasized that Bitcoin’s scarcity , immutability, and storability make it a strong long-term asset for national stability. “If we hold for 20 years — according to the best available models — we could reduce our national debt by half,” she said, referring to the country’s eye-popping $36 trillion debt. Saylor and Lummis push for Bitcoin as America’s strategic reserve Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor , also sparked discussion at the summit, going so far as to say during his discussion with Lummis that Bitcoin is the “Manifest Destiny for the United States of America.” Lummis also argued for creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve, stressing that it should be treated similarly to current national reserves. “We have a strategic oil reserve, we have a strategic gold reserve, we have a strategic cheese reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold,” she said. Lummis also pointed out this classic way of the government converting mineral wealth into cash possessed by the government, which then invests it into diversified assets that still generate cash. She views Bitcoin as a next-generation answer to an ancestral monetary problem. “I’ve kind of been looking for the Bitcoin strategic reserve my whole life,” Lummis added, clarifying that she believes it’s Bitcoin that will shape the country’s economic destiny. Saylor’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic asset resonated beyond the summit. Within an hour of his statement being posted on X, Bitcoin saw a 0.11% increase, reaching $87,273.47. The asset’s market capitalization grew by 0.09% at press time. The market’s reaction indicated a big change in sentiment, with the Fear and Greed Index rising from a complacent 50 to a “Greed” status of 65. Witnessing this in such a short timeframe demonstrates Bitcoin’s impact not just beyond political discourse but also in terms of market dynamics. Saylor stands firm on $13 Million Bitcoin prediction, calls it the ultimate store of value Just recently, Saylor doubled down on his claim that Bitcoin’s price will go to $13 million over 20 years. While addressing the Digital Asset Summit, Saylor emphasized Bitcoin’s unique qualities as a scarce digital commodity, arguing that no other asset can compare. “I can stand here and I can tell you that I think the price of Bitcoin will go to $13 million over 20 years. I couldn’t say that about a security, right?” Saylor declared, highlighting Bitcoin’s legal status as a commodity rather than a security. According to Saylor, Bitcoin is the only asset immune to human corruption. He refers to its origin as a product of what he calls an “immaculate conception.” He noted that, unlike traditional commodities like gold or oil, which can be extracted in greater quantities when prices rise, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it the ultimate store of value. Bitcoin bears seize opportunity as bullish bets weaken ahead of $16.5B options expiry On March 28, bitcoin investors are preparing for the all-time high $16.5 billion monthly options expiry. Despite this, the real impact on the market would be low, with BTC dropping below $90,000 before blindsiding investors and invalidating many bullish positions. This transition offers Bitcoin bears a key chance to avoid a potential $3 billion loss, which may exert considerable pressure on the markets in the weeks ahead. The open interest in call (buy) options is $10.5 billion, while the open interest in put (sell) options is $6 billion. However, $7.6 billion worth of those calls are for prices of $92,000 or higher, requiring Bitcoin to rise 6.4% from its current value to become profitable before the March 28 expiry. This has greatly reduced the edge for bullish bets. Some analysts cite the ongoing global tariff war and the US government spending cuts that risk sending the economy into a recession as impacting Bitcoin’s price. Traders are concerned about slower growth—especially in the artificial intelligence space, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high on Feb. 19 only to dip 7%. The 40-day correlation has been above 70% since early March, but for the bulls, Bitcoin is still due for a decoupling from the stock market. This is driving optimism across the board, fueled by central banks expanding the monetary base and companies such as GameStop (GME), Rumble (RUM), Metaplanet (TYO:3350) and Semler Scientific (SMLR) adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On the other hand, the upcoming ADA competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is attracting investors thanks to a 15,240% upside forecast. As the price of ADA ultimately depends on overall market conditions as well as adoption, the presale frenzy of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its well-structured tokenomics are leading expectations for gains in exponential growth. Currently in Phase 3 of its 11-stage presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $5,400,000 and over 7,200 holders. This phase comes in at $0.02 and is nearly full with over to 95% sold out, with Phase 4 trekking up to $0.025 in price, a 25% increase. A launch price of $0.06 will earn first movers a quick 200% profit as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is listed. And post-launch projections have greater upside potential, with some observers targeting a climb above $1. Cardano (ADA): Hopeful signs, but a long uphill battle ahead Analysts are split on the potential of Cardano (ADA) following its recent performance. Currently trading at $0.70, Cardano (ADA) would need to boom 1,300% to scale the heights of $10 — not everyone considers it a lofty aim. Advocates cite its strong fundamentals such as scalability and security as well as growing integrations with DeFi. But skeptics also believe Cardano (ADA) gradual development speed can prevent fast price appreciation around the project. In the meantime, Cardano (ADA) looks speculative with its upside, while its competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has a more evident growth path backed by solid use cases. While Cardano (ADA) is dependent on a general phase of market speculation, the lending model and corresponding buy-pressure mechanisms built into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generate demand through a snapshot process that leads to out-competition in terms of percentage profit gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Creates Excitement A similar initiative is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform. The token considers not only its short term goals but also its long-term stability. This fast-paced development of the presale reflects strong buyers confidence. With Phase 3 nears completion. Phase 4 will open with a 25% gain for all buyers at $0.02 with guaranteed 200% returns upon launch. MUTM tokenomics enable sustained growth past the first listing. Ongoing demand is created by the platform’s revenue-driven buybacks and staking rewards, reducing selling pressure. Analysts believe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may prop up to the round of $1 which will still give Phase 3 investors over 4,900% profits on investments. Mutuum Finance emphasizes on Security. Smart contract audit coming from one of the top Blockchain security experts in the industry CertiK. Once completed the results will be found on the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) official channels and will be published thereafter. Why Cardano (ADA) Can’t Compete with MUTM For Short-Term Gains Even though the long-term prospects of Cardano are undeniable, the road to $10 is nothing more than ‘a wishful thinking moment’ in the hands of the market gods. By contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a methodical, high-reward chance with clear milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale’s phased pricing model guarantees that early investors secure the bottom entry points, paving the way for maximum profit as the project moves forward. With the sale of Phase 3 almost complete, the opportunity to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.02 is rapidly running out of time. Now is the prime time to get involved with a 25% price increase for the next stage looming on the horizon and entry prices set to soar.

After months of silence, the energy in the market has shifted overnight. Forget the old memes—this new wave is driven by fresh hype, viral moments, and tokens that know how to tap into culture and capital. Leading the charge? Solana-based Morning Routine (ROUTINE), which went viral in record time, and Dragoin ($DDGN) , a game-ready, dragon-themed Ethereum token that’s quickly becoming the most anticipated presale in crypto. With money flooding in and community momentum skyrocketing, the meme coin comeback of 2025 is already breaking records—and it’s only just beginning. Morning Routine: A Viral Video Turns Into a $19M Crypto Hit Morning Routine didn’t just launch—it erupted . It started in late March 2025, when fitness influencer Ashton Hall’s eccentric TikTok—complete with early wakeups, banana facials, and ice-cold water slaps—caught fire on X (formerly Twitter). The internet couldn’t stop watching. With more than 667 million views in just four days, it was only a matter of time before crypto pounced. Developers launched ROUTINE on March 21, riding the viral wave and linking the token directly to Hall’s now-famous routine. In only 48 hours, the token’s market cap shot up to $19 million as traders raced in. True to meme coin form, it wasn’t a smooth ride. ROUTINE dropped 57% in hours, hit a low near $8 million, and then exploded back by 88% to reclaim a $15 million cap by Monday. Over 100 early movers made more than $10,000 each. The coin’s story became a case study in how fast culture and crypto can collide—and create real profits. ROUTINE proved one thing: virality still moves markets. But while it sparked a flash, Dragoin is preparing to deliver something far more lasting—and potentially far more lucrative. Dragoin Is Gaining Fast—And It’s Built to Last While ROUTINE rides a wave of instant fame, Dragoin ($DDGN) is building a foundation that could carry it for the long run. It’s not just riding the meme wave—it’s upgrading it. Dragoin is a play-to-earn token with a real product, a strong roadmap, and a tokenomics model that’s built for those who want big upside and utility. Running on Ethereum, Dragoin has 200 billion tokens—half of which are allocated to a 25-stage presale that’s already heating up. Prices increase with every stage, rewarding those who get in early. And the unsold tokens? Gone forever. Burned. This isn’t just another drop—it’s a deflation-powered rocket. The real kicker? Dragoin offers an interactive Telegram game where users hatch, train, and battle dragons to earn $DDGN. It’s fun, addictive, and already pulling users into the ecosystem. With staking, airdrops, referral bonuses, and a plan to renounce the smart contract at launch, Dragoin is ticking all the right boxes—and it’s not even fully live yet. Dragoin’s presale began strongly, offering Stage 1 tokens at only $0.0000292. With a clear roadmap targeting a launch price of $0.002, investors have a golden chance for impressive gains nearing 6,700%. Acting early in the presale secures the best possible price, providing significant upside potential and setting participants up for long-term success. Early entry also strengthens investors’ community status and influence within the Dragoin ecosystem. Why Dragoin Could Be the Meme Coin That Doesn’t Fade ROUTINE reminded everyone how fast memes can turn into money—but Dragoin is showing what comes next. Today’s traders want more than just a meme. They want something they can hold, use, and believe in past the first pump. Dragoin delivers that. With built-in scarcity, community rewards, and real gameplay, it’s creating something most meme coins never do— retention . While ROUTINE and others spike and dip, Dragoin is laying track for something far more sustainable. Its presale progress proves the market is watching. People are buying in before the hype peaks. This is the moment when early decisions could become huge wins. If you’re waiting for the “next big thing,” it might already be in motion. Q2 2025 is shaping up to be the most electric moment for meme coins in years. Morning Routine brought the buzz—but Dragoin is shaping up to bring the real returns. For those who sat out the Dogecoin run, missed Shiba’s breakout, or jumped too late into PEPE or Bonk, Dragoin is the chance to get in early again —but this time, with smarter fundamentals and more long-term potential. With a powerful presale, an actual game, and a roadmap that’s already being executed, Dragoin isn’t just another meme—it’s the one everyone’s going to talk about after it takes off. The question is: will you be in before it does?

Digital platforms that handle transactions, store personal information, or manage digital assets can benefit from blockchain’s ability to improve security and efficiency. E-commerce, social media, financial services, gaming, streaming, and real estate are among the industries that can benefit the most from blockchain technology. Companies are beginning to see its value in making transactions safer, reducing costs, and increasing trust between users and service providers. E-Commerce Platforms: Secure transactions and Fraud Prevention Online shopping has grown quickly, but fraud and security risks continue to cause problems for both buyers and sellers. Many platforms deal with chargebacks, identity theft, and fake products. Blockchain helps by making transactions more secure and easier to verify. Transactions recorded on a blockchain cannot be changed or reversed without permission, which stops chargeback scams and protects sellers from losses. Websites like eBay and AliExpress could use blockchain to support cryptocurrency transactions, making transactions faster and reducing reliance on banks. Some companies, including Shopify and Overstock, have already introduced blockchain-based transactions to improve security and build trust with their customers. Blockchain also helps verify where products come from. By scanning a blockchain-verified code, buyers can check if a product is real and track its journey from the manufacturer to their hands. This is useful for high-end goods and electronics, where counterfeit items are a common issue. Gaming Platforms: Fairness, Security, and Digital Ownership More gaming platforms are starting to use blockchain to improve security and make sure digital transactions are fair. Many online games now have systems where players can buy, sell, or trade virtual items. Blockchain helps by making these transactions more secure and allowing players to fully own their digital assets without the risk of them being changed or taken away. This technology is useful beyond gaming as well. Online learning platforms, virtual workspaces, and creative tools also benefit from better security and verified ownership of digital content. By using blockchain, these platforms can protect user data and ensure that digital records cannot be altered. Online casino platforms have started exploring blockchain technology to improve different aspects of their services. The rise in popularity of games such as slots has led to more people signing up, which means their personal data will need better protection. By integrating blockchain, online casino platforms can address security concerns, improve transaction efficiency, and offer transparency in game outcomes. This technology provides a way to maintain fair operations while giving users a verifiable record of their activity. Social Media Platforms: Data Privacy and Content Ownership Social media platforms store a lot of personal data, which makes them a common target for hackers. Many people are concerned about how their information is used and if outsiders can access it without permission. Blockchain can make social media safer by giving users control over their own data instead of leaving it in the hands of big companies. With blockchain-based social media, posts, messages, and personal details could be encrypted and stored across a secure network rather than kept on company-owned servers. This would make it harder for hackers to steal information and reduce the risk of large-scale data breaches. Platforms like Facebook, X, and Instagram have faced criticism for privacy concerns, while newer platforms like Minds and Mastodon are exploring blockchain-based alternatives that give users more control over their data. Fake accounts and misinformation are other problems that blockchain could help solve. By using a verification system built on blockchain, social media platforms could confirm that users are real people rather than bots or fraudulent accounts. This would help reduce spam, fake news, and manipulated engagement. Streaming Platforms: Content Protection and Royalty Transactions Streaming platforms for music, movies, and online courses often face problems with content ownership and making sure artists and creators get paid fairly. Blockchain can help by using smart contracts that automatically send transactions to creators whenever their content is accessed. With blockchain, streaming platforms like Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube could track exactly how many times a song, film, or online lesson is played and send transactions directly to the creator without needing a third party to process them. Some music platforms, like Audius, are already using blockchain to give artists more control over their earnings. Blockchain also helps stop unauthorized copies from spreading. When a song, movie, or course is registered on a blockchain, its ownership is recorded in a way that cannot be changed.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-28 01:02:48

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is standing out with its innovative presale strategy and deflationary token model, attracting early investors eager for massive returns. APC’s weekly token burns and lucrative referral rewards create a strong foundation for long-term value growth. Meanwhile, Toshi and Book of Meme are also making headlines, with increasing market traction and impressive trading volumes. Arctic Pablo Coin is on the list of Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. These projects are redefining the meme coin space, offering more than just hype—they bring unique community engagement and strategic growth plans. This article will dive into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Toshi, and Book of Meme, with a special focus on the presale excitement surrounding APC and why it could be the next big crypto success. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Strategy: Boosting Scarcity and Value Scarcity drives value in cryptocurrency, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is leveraging this principle with an aggressive token burn mechanism. Unsold tokens during the presale are permanently eliminated every week, ensuring that supply remains controlled. Additionally, once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, fostering a deflationary environment designed to enhance long-term value. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Arctic Pablo Coin integrates a transparent burn strategy recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring all transactions remain verifiable. Arctic Pablo Coin is on the list of Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now. By reducing the overall supply over time, this mechanism aims to strengthen APC’s market potential and provide long-term sustainability for investors. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale at Crystal Cove: A Golden Entry Point Before Prices Rise The Meme Coin presale has now reached Crystal Cove, the 16th phase of its journey, marking an exciting milestone for early investors. At this stage, 1 APC is priced at just $0.000083, offering an attractive entry point before prices surge. With the launch price set at $0.008, early investors have the potential to achieve a staggering 9,552.41% ROI. To put this into perspective, an investment of $1,000 today would secure approximately 12,048,190 APC tokens, which could skyrocket to $96,385.52 upon listing. With over $2 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin continues to gain momentum, drawing in both retail and institutional investors. As APC progresses through new locations, the token price is expected to rise. The presale offers a rare chance to enter at a low price before the next phase increases costs, making this a limited-time investment opportunity for those looking to maximize their returns. Toshi’s Market Performance: Growing Market Cap and Strong Trading Volume Toshi has been making waves in the crypto market, currently trading at $0.000337 per token (TOSHI/USD) with a market capitalization of $137.54 million. Its 24-hour trading volume of $14.66 million highlights strong investor interest and market engagement. What sets Toshi apart is its unique blend of meme culture and crypto fundamentals, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The project’s strong community support, coupled with consistent market performance, has contributed to its increasing popularity. As meme coins continue to evolve beyond speculation, Toshi’s growing adoption and trading activity position it as a serious contender in the space. With its expanding ecosystem and rising demand, Toshi is proving to be more than just another meme token—it’s a project with lasting potential. Book of Meme’s Trading Volume Surges, Driving Investor Interest Another meme coin making waves in the crypto space is Book of Meme (BOME), currently trading at $0.001569. What’s fueling its rise? A 24-hour trading volume of $161.94 million showcases massive investor interest and growing market demand. Book of Meme isn’t just riding the meme coin hype—it’s carving out a unique niche by blending internet culture with blockchain innovation. With such high trading volumes, the token continues to solidify its position as a top-performing meme coin, attracting both short-term traders seeking volatility and long-term investors who believe in its potential. As the meme coin sector expands, Book of Meme’s strong market performance and rising adoption make it a project to watch for those looking to capitalize on the next big crypto trend. Final Words: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge in the Meme Coin Frenzy The meme coin market is buzzing with action, with Arctic Pablo Coin, Toshi, and Book of Meme each offering unique opportunities for investors. Arctic Pablo Coin, however, stands out due to its strategic token burn mechanism and presale structure, which has already raised over $2 million.

Musk stated that his Department of Government Efficiency is set to achieve these savings within 130 days from the start of Trump’s term on January 20. Musk explained that the plan would involve cutting more than half of the $1.8 trillion spent on non-defense discretionary programs in 2024. “I think we will accomplish most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that time frame,” he said. The billionaire added that his aim is to cut 15% of the government’s annual spending, which totaled $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He confidently said that these reductions could be made without affecting any of the critical government services. Musk, classified as a special government employee who is allowed to work only 130 days out of the year as a temporary federal worker, spoke of a sweeping reform effort. DOGE is still far from reaching the $1 trillion target The interview came just days after President Trump said he expected to be “satisfied” with DOGE’s cuts in the coming month or two. Trump acknowledged that the overhauls led by DOGE are not “necessarily a very popular thing to do,” noting the political risks tied to such wide-ranging cuts. Most of the federal government’s spending is allocated to mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security, where there is little room for reductions. Musk has claimed that these programs are overrun with fraud and waste, though he did not provide supporting evidence for these assertions.In response, DOGE has deployed at least 10 staffers to the Social Security Administration to identify waste. However, data shows that from 2015 through 2022, Social Security estimated nearly $72 billion in improper payments, which makes less than 1% of benefits paid, according to an inspector general report from last year. The DOGE website, which has been criticized for errors and overstatements, currently lists about $22 billion in contract savings. The website also claims about $130 billion in overall cost reductions, although these figures are not itemized. Musk has downplayed the effect of job cuts Musk’s DOGE has also pushed a series of federal government layoffs that have been implemented in the past few weeks. While several agencies have announced workforce reductions, Musk dismissed the impact of these job cuts by saying that “almost no one’s gotten fired.” Among the recent changes, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a cut of 10,000 jobs earlier on Thursday. In March the Education Department stated that it was reducing its workforce by half. Moreover, the Small Business Administration is cutting 43% of its workforce. The Department of Veterans Affairs has announced plans to layoff 80,000 workers, while the Treasury Department shared major cuts planned in a court filing. DOGE’s efforts have also faced legal hurdles. This includes judges rejecting some of the proposed cuts and blocking Musk’s team from accessing certain systems and databases such as those at the Social Security Administration.

In a statement on Thursday, Crypto.com confirmed that the SEC would not be pursuing any enforcement action against the company. The SEC has yet to respond to requests for comment. Under the previous administration, the SEC weaponized and attempted to expand its congressionally granted power to harm an industry that its former chair disfavored, according to Crypto.com Chief Legal Officer Nick Lundgren. He added that it was unfortunate they had to endure a years-long investigation and file their own lawsuit against the SEC to protect the rule of law. The SEC has recently dismissed multiple investigations and lawsuits against crypto firms, including those involving Kraken and Coinbase. Earlier this month, the agency also opted to drop its appeal in the case against Ripple. Crypto.com’s legal battle and the SEC’s changing stance on crypto regulation Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October after receiving a Wells notice, signalling the potential for charges. In its lawsuit, Crypto.com argued that the SEC had overreached its jurisdiction and challenged the agency’s stance that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. That lawsuit was dropped in December. The regulatory watchdog has changed significantly over the past several weeks following the beginning of the Trump administration and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s exit at the beginning of the year. Since the year began, the SEC has rescinded controversial crypto accounting guidance, dropped enforcement actions against major crypto industry players and formed a crypto task force. Additionally, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s pick for the SEC chairmanship, Paul Atkins, faced questions from lawmakers about the agency’s past actions and his ties to bankrupt FTX. Atkins said he planned to make creating a regulatory framework for digital assets a “top priority.” According to its statement, Crypto.com serves more than 140 million customers worldwide. In a notable development, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. announced earlier this week that it had signed a non-binding agreement with Crypto.com to collaborate on launching a range of exchange-traded funds and products under the Truth.Fi fintech brand. SEC drops multiple crypto cases, but some firms still face uncertainty In the fewer than three months since U.S. President Donald Trump took office, the SEC’s investigations into crypto exchange Gemini, trading platform Robinhood, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, NFT company Yuga Labs, and Immutable, and now Crypto.com have all been dropped, with no enforcement charges filed. The agency’s litigation against crypto companies, including Kraken, Coinbase, ConsenSys, Ripple, and Cumberland DRW, has also been dropped. Still, more litigation has been paused, including the SEC’s cases against Tron and Binance. But, not everyone who received a Wells notice is off the SEC’s hook yet. Crypto issuer Unicoin received a Wells notice last year informing the firm that the SEC planned to bring charges alleging violations related to fraud, deceptive practices and the offer and sale of unregistered securities. A spokesperson for Unicoin recently said that the firm “remains in the final stages of the SEC review process. The spokesperson noted: “As of now, we have not received any new updates or formal feedback from the SEC regarding our registration. We are fully committed to compliance and transparency, and we continue to work toward securing the necessary approvals for our planned offerings.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Attributes such as initial progress, expanding supporter bases, or significant advancements on the horizon, some ventures are distinguishing themselves. XRP, BlockDAG, Aptos, and Celestia have all garnered attention for various reasons, and not solely from the typical audience. As the cryptocurrency market evolves and new challengers emerge, these four merit close observation. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Substantial Expansion, Vast Return Possibilities BlockDAG (BDAG) is an advanced Layer 1 protocol engineered for extensive scalability. Contrary to conventional blockchains that decelerate under load, it utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture to execute transactions concurrently—enhancing speed without compromising efficiency. This structure is optimal for supporting a wide range of applications from DeFi to gaming and financial transactions. Beyond theoretical advantages—concrete figures support this. BlockDAG has successfully secured over $207 million in its presale phase, distributed over 18.9 billion coins, and achieved a price increase from $0.001 to $0.0248—marking a 2,380% rise in just 27 batches. The real intrigue lies in the projected long-term gains. With current progress and ecosystem growth, analysts predict up to a 30,000x ROI for early participants. This projection has attracted over 170,000 unique holders, with significant events such as the mainnet launch and numerous exchange listings forthcoming. For those evaluating their options and seeking the best long term crypto for higher returns, BlockDAG presents a compelling combination of robust fundamentals and potential for expansion. This isn”t just speculation—it’s a momentum supported by tangible achievements. 2. XRP (XRP): Momentum Builds as Legal Hurdles Clear XRP is renowned for its ability to accelerate international payments—completing transactions in just seconds at low costs. It ranks as one of the leading altcoins with a market cap of $13 billion. The lengthy SEC lawsuit that cast doubt on its future has concluded, clearing significant obstacles. Since the case closed, XRP has maintained a stable price around $2.39, with optimistic forecasts suggesting a rise to between $5 and $100 in future years. While these predictions are speculative, the newfound legal clarity might attract renewed interest. For those searching for the best long-term crypto for higher returns, XRP now faces fewer obstacles. 3. Aptos (APT): Is Speed the Key to Its Value Over Time? Aptos boasts a high-speed blockchain, capable of processing up to 160,000 transactions per second with parallel execution. Developed using the Move language and supported by a Proof-of-Stake consensus, it’s rapidly becoming the go-to platform for developers creating scalable dApps. Aptos has recently reached about 15 million monthly users and ranks as the fourth-largest blockchain by daily transactions. Its current price is approximately $5.45, with future values potentially reaching between $26 and over $100 by 2030. For those looking at the best long-term crypto for higher returns, Aptos offers robust technical foundations paired with increasing practical application. 4. Celestia (TIA): Promising Potential for Sustained Gains Celestia (TIA) introduces a modular approach to blockchain by separating data availability from execution, thus improving scalability. The TIA token supports the network’s proof-of-stake mechanism, allowing users to stake tokens with validators for rewards. Developers use TIA for data storage costs within Celestia’s unique blobspace, enhancing roll-up operations without separate gas tokens. Currently, TIA trades at about $3.31, with predictions for 2025 ranging from $7.81 to $14.23, and by 2030, potentially hitting up to $47.47. For those seeking the best long-term crypto for higher returns, Celestia’s groundbreaking structure and tokenomics offer an attractive prospect. The Bottom Line These altcoins each present unique strengths—XRP with its transaction speed and clear legal status, Aptos with its scalable technology, and Celestia with its modern blockchain design. Yet, BlockDAG leads the pack for various reasons. BlockDAG isn’t just capitalizing on initial buzz—the data already indicates significant progress, and the potential for substantial growth is undeniable. With consistent price increases and a forecasted 30,000x ROI, BlockDAG stands out as a top choice for the best long term crypto for higher returns. The opportunity is narrowing, suggesting now might be the time to consider BDAG at current levels.

The strong rebound follows a brutal correction in which AVAX lost over 72% of its value since mid-December 2024, triggering widespread capitulation and fear across the market. Now, with price action showing signs of strength, investors are cautiously optimistic — but uncertainty remains.

Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X, pointing out that the TD Sequential indicator is now presenting a fresh sell signal. This suggests that AVAX may be due for a short-term pullback or a period of sideways movement. With the broader market still under pressure, traders are watching closely to see whether Avalanche can maintain its gains or lose momentum. Avalanche Wakes Up But Faces Serious Risks Avalanche is showing signs of life after enduring months of intense selling pressure. Like many altcoins, AVAX has been heavily impacted by macroeconomic volatility, losing over 70% of its value since mid-December 2024. Now, as bullish momentum begins to return across select altcoins, Avalanche is attempting to stage a recovery rally. The recent 53% surge since March 11 has revived hopes that AVAX could be ready to break out — but headwinds still remain. The broader market environment continues to be shaped by uncertainty. Trade war fears and unstable macroeconomic signals have kept pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Many investors remain cautious and are still offloading positions near current levels, concerned about the long-term direction of the market. While momentum is returning to some sectors, the path for Avalanche is far from clear. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted a technical development using the TD Sequential indicator. After accurately calling the recent bottom and a 50% rally in AVAX, the indicator is now flashing a sell signal. This suggests that Avalanche could be due for a short-term retrace or period of consolidation before any further move higher. The $22 level remains a crucial resistance zone for AVAX. A temporary cooldown here may be healthy — giving bulls time to regroup before attempting a breakout. If AVAX can hold key support and reset after the current rally, it could build a stronger foundation for a decisive push above $22 in the weeks ahead. For now, all eyes are on price action as Avalanche balances between correction and continuation in a market still clouded by uncertainty.

The recent pullback reflects cooling momentum as bulls struggle to maintain pressure near short-term resistance. Still, the trend remains intact — for now. To sustain the recovery rally, bulls must defend current levels and push toward reclaiming the $30 mark, which aligns with the 200-day moving average (MA) and 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). A successful breakout above this zone would be a strong bullish signal and could mark the beginning of a larger uptrend. However, failure to hold above $20 in the coming days would be a warning sign. A breakdown below this level could trigger increased selling pressure and send AVAX back toward the $17 zone — a key support area from previous consolidations. As Avalanche continues to trade within a volatile range, the next few sessions will be crucial in determining short-term direction.

A decisive move above $30 remains the target, but holding the $20 level is just as important to avoid a deeper retrace and renewed bearish sentiment.

He pointed out that there was no strong conviction yet to ‘play Europe over the US over the next six-to-12 months’. Boivin predicted that the U.S. would see the strongest earnings growth within the coming six-to-12 months. The strategist said a 10% tariff was likely the best possible landing zone, and the US can adjust to that. However, he cautioned that the tariffs would be a ‘different story’ if they exceeded 10%. Charlie Bilello, the chief market strategist at Creative Planning, also said that U.S. stocks had been outperforming international stocks by a big margin for 16 years running. According to Bilello, the U.S. was now more than three standard deviations above the mean in terms of historical outperformance. Boivin favors U.S. stocks over European equities US equities will soon regain their long-held edge over European peers, according to Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute https://t.co/ulgY1BnrSr — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) March 27, 2025 Boivin said US equities will soon regain their long-held edge over European stocks, as the future of European stocks was limited to sectors such as defense and banks. He added that he expected U.S. earnings downgrades to be short-lived as tariff-related uncertainty came to an end. However, UBS’s chief strategist Bhanu Baweja said this week he expected the S&P 500 to drop another 8% as a consumer slowdown continued to squeeze corporate earnings. Keith Lerner, the Co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Market Strategist at Truist Advisory Services, also said the US outperformed Europe by 20% since December, but markets did not move in straight lines. He pointed out that Europe’s defense-driven rally may pause, while US fiscal stimulus offered short-term opportunities. “The US is the place where we expect to see the strongest earnings growth on a six-to-12 month horizon.” – Jean Boivin As per Reuters reports on March 27th, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 20.71 points or 0.05% to 42,478.39, the S&P 500 (.SPX) climbed 6.42 points or 0.12% to 5,718.66, and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) advanced 21.25 points or 0.09% to 17,920.27. Meanwhile, European stocks fell, with weakness in shares of Europe’s top carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) down nearly 2%, BMW (BMWG.DE) losing almost 3%, and Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) sliding more than 4%. U.S. economy has grown faster than expected since the end of 2024 A Commerce Department report on March 27th revealed that the U.S. economy grew a little faster than expected in the final three months of 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also said in its last of three estimates that the U.S. GDP accelerated at a 2.4% pace for the October-through-December period. That was 0.2 percentage points ahead of the previous estimate and came from an upward revision to consumer spending, which grew at a 4% rate in the fourth quarter. In addition to the upward change in GDP, the BEA noted that core inflation was a bit softer than previously indicated. The personal consumption expenditures price index (excluding food and energy prices), which the Federal Reserve uses as its primary inflation gauge, increased by 2.6%, down 0.1 percentage points from the prior estimate. CNBC also reported that the major indexes were clinging to marginal gains as stocks flitted between gains and losses this week. The S&P 500 ticked up nearly 0.8%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.5%. The 30-stock Dow has also added 1% this week thus far. Within the S&P 500 sectors, communication services, consumer discretionary, and financials saw the largest gains, whereas utilities, health care, and real estate were the main decliners. However, sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose in February, recovering from a drop in January. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of the first to take part in the trend, posting a portrait of himself generated by the model on March 25 but said in a subsequent post two days later that all image requests have started to tax the firm’s infrastructure. “It’s super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT but our GPUs are melting. We are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient,” he said. Source: Sam Altman “Also, we are refusing some generations that should be allowed; we are fixing these as fast we can,” he added. OpenAI launched the upgraded image generation offering in ChatGPT-4o on March 25, resulting in users splashing images across social media in the art style of Studio Ghibli — known for its anime films Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro . Altman didn’t give a definitive timeline on how long the rate limits would last but said, “Hopefully, it won’t be long! ChatGPT free tier will get three generations per day soon.” Rate limits are generally applied to help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure, according to OpenAI. Related: Ghibli memecoins surge as internet flooded with Studio Ghibli-style AI images “If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users,” OpenAI says on its rate limit explanation page. Along with the legions of others getting in on the trend, X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared an image mimicking King Mufasa from Disney’s The Lion King holding up a Shiba Inu. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks also joined in, using the Studio Ghibli-art style on an image of himself at an event. Source: David Sacks Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported on March 26 that OpenAI expects to more than triple its revenue this year to $12.7 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter. Altman said on Feb. 12 his firm wants to ship GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the coming weeks or months.

That future is unfolding right now with Qubetics, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI), and Quant. Each of these projects is pushing blockchain technology into uncharted territories, solving critical inefficiencies in digital finance and beyond. Qubetics is leading the best penny crypto to buy and charge with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Meanwhile, ASI’s groundbreaking SQD XSpaces upgrade is redefining AI-driven blockchain automation. Quant continues its mission to enhance blockchain interoperability, partnering with Oracle to revolutionize digital assets. Qubetics: The Best Penny Crypto to Buy in 2025 Qubetics is a next-generation blockchain project designed to tokenize real-world assets, making them tradable, accessible, and liquid. Through its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, physical and financial assets can be digitized and exchanged securely, removing barriers that have long restricted asset ownership to select entities. Imagine a scenario where a property owner wants to liquidate assets without selling the entire property. Through Qubetics, they can tokenize their real estate, allowing fractional ownership while maintaining control over their property. Similarly, businesses can tokenize high-value assets like intellectual property, machinery, or fine art, providing instant liquidity without traditional banking restrictions. With Qubetics ($TICS) currently priced at $0.1300 in its crypto presale , even a modest $100 investment secures around 769 tokens. Based on the latest stats—over $15.5 million raised, 504 million $TICS tokens sold, and a rapidly expanding base of 23,900+ holders—the project’s momentum is undeniable, one of the best penny crypto to buy. Now, consider the potential: if $TICS reaches just $1, that $100 turns into $769. At $5, it climbs to $3,845. Push it to $10, and you’re looking at $7,690. But if $TICS hits $15, that small $100 outlay could explode into a staggering $11,535, representing a potential 11,437% ROI. In a market where many projects still lack direction or utility, Qubetics stands out as a presale delivering both numbers and real-world impact. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI): AI & Blockchain Innovation ASI is rapidly gaining attention in the AI-blockchain sector, especially with the rollout of the SQD XSpaces upgrade, which introduces cutting-edge enhancements in smart contract security, AI-assisted trading, and DeFi automation. This technological leap positions ASI at the forefront of AI-driven blockchain ecosystems. Another major milestone is the ASI token merger, which consolidates SingularityNET (AGIX) and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) into Fetch.ai’s FET token. This strategic unification is designed to streamline interoperability and operational efficiency, creating a cohesive infrastructure for AI-based decentralized applications. In terms of market activity, FET is currently priced at $0.556269, with a 24-hour trading volume of $112.19 million. Despite a 4.11% dip in the past 24 hours, the momentum surrounding ASI’s developments suggests growing market confidence in its long-term vision. Quant: The Powerhouse of Blockchain Interoperability Quant continues to solidify its position as a leader in blockchain interoperability, especially as it bridges the gap between decentralized systems and traditional finance. Its recent partnership with Oracle marks a pivotal advancement—integrating Overledger technology into Oracle’s blockchain infrastructure to enable frictionless cross-chain transactions across enterprise environments. Quant’s growing influence is further highlighted by its participation in Project Rosalind, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative led by the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub and the Bank of England. This involvement underscores Quant’s commitment to shaping the future of digital finance at an institutional level. On the market front, QNT is trading at $77.66, with a 24-hour volume of $19.93 million, reflecting a 2.54% decline in the last 24 hours. Despite the dip, Quant’s integration with major financial entities signals strong long-term utility and resilience. The Future of Blockchain: Qubetics, ASI, & Quant Blockchain technology is undergoing a major transformation. Qubetics is revolutionizing real-world asset tokenization, ASI is pioneering AI-powered automation, and Quant is breaking down blockchain barriers. For those looking for projects with real utility, Qubetics stands out as the best penny crypto to buy in 2025. With its explosive presale performance, Qubetics is proving to be more than just another token—it’s an entirely new financial infrastructure. Those who recognize its potential now are positioning themselves ahead of the next major shift in blockchain technology.

Bpifrance said in a March 27 press release that it would back newly formed projects “with a strong French footprint” where it will receive tokens in return for its investment and will look to fund decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, tokenization and artificial intelligence. It added that the plan, supported by the French Ministry of Economy and Finance, was to “promote emerging technologies and strengthen the French blockchain ecosystem.” The global blockchain ecosystem is “currently booming” but the number of French funds taking part is still very limited, it said. French digital and AI minister Clara Chappaz said public and private financing was “one of the keys to the sustainable positioning of our ecosystem on the international stage.” Bpifrance deputy CEO Arnaud Caudoux said that it was convinced of the growing importance that blockchain companies “will take on in the years to come and want to increase French competitiveness and presence in the digital assets field.” “The US is really accelerating its own crypto strategy, so this is all the more important,” Caudoux said at a press conference, as reported by Reuters. He added that Bpifrance had started to support crypto before the US started its own pro-crypto moves. Bpifrance’s headquarters in Paris. Source: Google The bank said it had backed the blockchain sector for a decade and had invested over 150 million euros ($162 million), notably helping to finance the crypto hardware wallet company Ledger in 2014. Bpifrance said it began testing limited investments through tokens in 2022, including a deal with the DeFi lending platform Morpho to buy its token — which has grown to be the 12th largest protocol by value at $3.24 billion, according to DefiLlama.

A portion of the token supply is usually immediately given to select public users in order to drum up liquidity, which can cause token values to slide if they cash out.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal describes the dismissal of the staking lawsuit as the falling of dominoes, eyeing more states to toe the same line. South Carolina Terminates Staking Lawsuit After nearly two years, South Carolina is changing its stance on Coinbase staking. According to an announcement , South Carolina is ditching its lawsuit against the exchange regarding the provision of staking services to users. Going forward, Coinbase says it will begin rolling out staking services for South Carolina residents. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal notes that the exchange is keen on putting a torrid two-year period behind it and relaunching staking services. According to Grewal, South Carolina residents have lost nearly $2 million in staking rewards following the legal battle. Carolina joins a growing number of states to reverse their stance on Coinbase staking. “This is not just a victory for us, but for American consumers and we hope it’s a sign of things to come in the few states left that restrict staking,” said Grewal. US authorities have softened their stance on staking with industry giants like CBOE filing for staking in Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF. Coinbase Enjoys A String Of Regulatory Victories Coinbase is on a red-hot streak of regulatory victories in recent weeks. At the top of the pile is the SEC’s dismissal of its lawsuit against Coinbase without prejudice, triggering excitement. Coinbase has filed an FOIA request against the SEC to probe the financials of its regulatory actions against the industry. Meanwhile, the exchange is pursuing similar information discovery against the FDIC with Grewal criticizing the handling of the FOIA request. The top exchange has set up shop in India after a two-year hiatus, clinching approval from local regulators. Coinbase acquisition of Deribit is considered a major move in the ecosystem claims of self-centric motives over the exchange’s silence in Ripple’s case have soured sentiments.

BTC is now consolidating and might aim for a move above the $88,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a fresh recovery wave above the $86,800 zone. The price is trading below $87,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $88,000 and $88,200 levels. Bitcoin Price Faces Key Resistance Bitcoin price remained stable above the $85,500 level. BTC formed a base and recently started a recovery wave above the $86,500 resistance level. The bulls pushed the price above the $87,200 resistance level. There was even a move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $88,260 swing high to the $85,852 swing low. However, the bears seem to be active below the $88,000 level. Bitcoin price is now trading below $87,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average .

The first key resistance is near the $88,000 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $88,250. A close above the $88,250 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $88,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $90,000 level or even $90,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $88,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $86,800 level. The first major support is near the $86,400 level. The next support is now near the $85,850 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $85,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $84,500.

Presales offer investors an opportunity to buy in at a fixed and discounted rate, therefore maximizing upside potential. These presale events can provide substantial gains in bullish periods like the one we’re currently entering. With that in mind, here are the five best crypto presales to buy now: Solaxy Solaxy is working toward a new era for Solana, building its first-ever layer 2 blockchain. It uses off-chain computation and transaction bundling technology to tackle Solana’s congestion issue, which it has grappled with for years. With over $27 million raised, Solaxy’s presale success reflects the market’s trust. The project will make Solana cheaper, faster, and more scalable. This will, in effect, open Solana to new use cases and expand its current ones, such as meme coins, AI, and DeFi. Given that Solana is worth over $65 billion, the potential impact that Solaxy could make creates a massive opportunity for the $SOLX token to rise in price. It’s clear that investors are well aware of this potential, given the project’s presale momentum. Therefore, prospective investors hoping to get in early should act quickly. Visit Solaxy Presale BTC Bull Token BTC Bull Token is a Bitcoin-themed meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. But it isn’t just a meme coin – it’s the first cryptocurrency to pay its community Bitcoin rewards. It’s a setup that economically aligns the performance of BTC Bull Token with that of Bitcoin. The higher Bitcoin’s price goes, the more valuable BTC Bull Token rewards become. The project will pay Bitcoin and BTC Bull Token rewards to holders at key milestones on Bitcoin’s journey to $1 million – starting when it hits $100K. As Bitcoin rises, it tends to drag the rest of the market up with it. Therefore, BTC Bull Token holders will simultaneously benefit from price appreciation and a growing position of $BTC and $BTCBULL. There are also staking and burning mechanisms to help boost the project’s supply and demand dynamics. The $BTCBULL presale has raised $4 million so far. By aligning meme coin virality with Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, BTC Bull Token is one of the most promising presales on the market. Visit BTC Bull Token Presale MIND Of Pepe MIND Of Pepe is a Pepe-themed AI agent operating on the Ethereum blockchain. The project grasps the current market dynamics while also positioning for the future. The meme coin market is thriving right now, but it seems that the AI agent sector is also making a comeback. It saw a huge boom in December and is now waking up again, with its trading volume jumping 24% today. As the next AI agent rally approaches, MIND Of Pepe is set for considerable success. The project will identify trading opportunities and share them with $MIND holders. It can also launch tokens and interact with dApps, all for the betterment of the community. Moreover, the agent introduces a technology called “hive mind analysis,” which allows it to learn from the data it collects and become more powerful over time. The presale has raised $7.5 million so far. By blending the allure of Pepe coin with cutting-edge AI utility, MIND Of Pepe separates itself from other meme coins and AI agents on the market. Visit MIND Of Pepe Presale Best Wallet Token Best Wallet token is the new cryptocurrency that will power multichain crypto wallet Best Wallet. The wallet is packed with features to make life easier when trading on-chain. However, one of its main pillars is Upcoming Tokens, a presale aggregator that allows users to buy promising new presales directly from the app. Some previous projects listed on Upcoming Tokens, such as Pepe Unchained and Catslap, provided investors with gains of between 10x and 50x. Best Wallet also offers a cross-chain DEX, a crypto debit card, a staking aggregator, derivatives trading, and much more. The $BEST token provides trading fee discounts, higher staking yields, governance rights, and access to promotions on partner projects. So far, the $BEST presale has raised $11.3 million, illustrating strong demand. But with $BEST allowing users to save money and gain new opportunities, there’s every chance its demand continues to soar as the wallet gains more eyeballs, giving it serious price potential. Visit Best Wallet Token Presale Meme Index Every day, new meme coins emerge, and early traders get rich. But with projects launching all the time, it’s hard to keep track. While it can be highly lucrative, meme coin trading is also risky. Meme Index understands this and provides a solution. It’s building the world’s first decentralized meme coin index investing app. These indexes are like meme-styled ETFs. They contain a range of different meme coins. Buying the index gives price exposure to them all, spreading risk and increasing the chances of catching a winner. Four indexes are available, each with a different level of volatility and risk. This means there’s something for all investors. Like Best Wallet token, utility is at the heart of $MEMEX. Users must hold it to access the platform, and it also provides governance and staking rights. Meme Index could change how investors trade meme coins, and if it does, there will be massive demand for $MEMEX. Visit Meme Index Presale Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

The new proposal — made by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in a Technical Advice report to the European Commission on March 27 — would set a far stricter standard than other asset classes, such as stocks and real estate, which don’t even need to be half-backed. “EIOPA considers a 100% haircut in the standard formula prudent and appropriate for these assets in view of their inherent risks and high volatility,” it said in a separate statement. Such a measure would fill a regulatory gap between the Capital Requirements Regulation and Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), EIOPA said, noting that the European Union’s regulatory framework for insurers currently lacks specific provisions on crypto assets. Circle argued in January that a blanket 100% stress factor on crypto assets didn’t account for lower-risk stablecoins. Source: Circle EIOPA outlined four options for the European Commission to consider — one: make no changes; two: mandate an 80% “stress level” to crypto assets; and three: mandate a 100% stress level to crypto asset. The stress level percentages determine how much capital firms need to hold to stay solvent. The fourth option called on the European Commission to consider the risks of tokenized assets more broadly. EIOPA said option three would be the most appropriate option. “An 80% stress to the value of crypto-asset exposures does not appear sufficiently prudent,” whereas “a 100% stress is more appropriate and aligns with one of the approaches to the transitional treatment of crypto-assets under CRR,” EIOPA said. The 100% stress refers to the assumption that the crypto asset prices could fall by 100% and that diversification — spreading the risk across different assets — wouldn’t not reduce this stress. EIOPA pointed out that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) have fallen 82% and 91%, respectively, in the past. A 100% capital charge for crypto assets would reflect a far stricter approach compared to stocks, which range between 39% and 49%, and real estate, which incurs a 25% capital charge, according to solvency capital requirements laid out in the Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. EIOPA said a 100% capital charge for crypto asset-related (re)insurance undertakings shouldn’t be “overly burdensome” and that there would be no material costs for policyholders. “The capital requirements would fully capture the risk of crypto-asset with a positive impact on policyholder protection in case there are material exposures in the future.” Related: Tabit offers USD insurance policies backed by Bitcoin regulatory capital EIOPA acknowledged that the share of crypto-asset (re)insurance undertakings accounts for just 655 million euros or 0.0068% of all undertakings in Europe — even referring to it as “immaterial.” “At the same time crypto assets are high risk investments which may result in total loss of value,” EIOPA said, explaining why it recommends option three. Luxembourg and Sweden could be hit hardest by the proposed rule Insurers in Luxembourg and Sweden are likely to be the most affected, according to a Q4 2023 report cited by EIOPA, which found that these two countries accounted for 69% and 21% of all crypto asset-related exposures among (re)insurance undertakings. Ireland, Denmark and Liechtenstein also accounted for 3.4%, 1.4% and 1.2% of the undertakings. Most of these undertakings are structured within funds, such as exchange-traded funds, and held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders, EIOPA noted.

One minute they’re mooning, the next minute you’re wondering where your investment went. But lately, two coins have been stirring up the crypto scene: Slerf—with its explosive presale saga and ongoing refund frenzy, and Simon’s Cat—dropping a new mobile game and clawing its way up the charts. While both are making noise, there’s one coin quietly locking down the throne with cold-hard numbers among the top new meme coins to join today: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Let’s be real—presales are the crypto investor’s haven. No wild price swings, no rug-pull panic, and most importantly, massive upside potential. And BTFD isn’t just riding the wave—it’s building the damn ocean. From a fully functional P2E game and 90% staking APY to the unmatched community power of the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin is lighting up presale charts and making early buyers feel like they’ve struck digital gold. Want in? Keep reading—because these are the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Can the Bulls Squad Deliver 2900% ROI and 100% Bonus? What happens when you take a market meme like “ Buy The Dip ” and turn it into a full-blown movement? You get BTFD Coin—a presale powerhouse backed by a die-hard community called the Bulls Squad. These aren’t just token holders; they’re a movement. Led by mascots like Baby Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Raging Bull, this squad’s mission is simple: stack dips, ride the next bull run, and laugh all the way to the bank. Now in its 15th stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.0002. And with one final stage to go, time is ticking. Over 72 billion coins have already been sold, with $6.42 million raised and more than 11,600 wallet holders. The listing price? $0.0006. That’s a clean 200% ROI just for showing up early. But the real kicker? Analysts believe $BTFD could reach a moon price of $0.006—a jaw-dropping 2900% return from today’s presale level. Let’s run some numbers: if you throw $1500 into the current presale price ($0.0002), you get 7.5 million BTFD tokens. Apply the LAUNCH100 code and you’ll get double that—15 million tokens. If BTFD hits $0.0006, that’s $9,000. And if it reaches the projected moonshot of $0.006, you’re looking at $90,000. All from a $1500 play. Wild, right? Hey Bulls, major announcement your way: BTFD is offering a one-time 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100). Buy now in Stage 15 and your tokens will be DOUBLED. That’s twice the gains. But here’s the twist—this offer disappears after March 30. So if you’ve ever wanted to flex on your crypto group chat, now’s your shot with the top new meme coin to join today. This isn’t just about buying low—it’s about staking smart too. With meme coin presale staking at 90% APY, BTFD Coin lets you double dip: get coins, stake them, and earn even more while chilling with the Bulls. The game’s already live, the staking is real, and the hype is snowballing. Want to grab your BTFD stash? 1: Go to BTFD Presale . 2: Connect your wallet. 3: Enter code LAUNCH100 (all caps), hit apply. 4: Choose how much to buy. 5: Hit “Buy Now” and confirm. BTFD Coin Rewards Program: Got friends? Get paid. Share your unique referral code and bag 10% in $BTFD if your code ranks in the top 20. Your referrals even get 10% extra BTFD if they drop $50+. More friends, more coins, more bragging rights. So whether you’re a seasoned whale or a crypto cub, this is your moment. The dip is here with the top new meme coin to join today. The Bulls are ready. BTFD or get left behind. Slerf (SLERF): Refunds, Regrets, and Redemption? Slerf has turned into the wild child of Solana. After accidentally burning $10 million worth of presale funds, most projects would’ve folded. Not Slerf. With a market cap still hovering around $33 million and the price at ~$0.0672, it’s clawing back community trust. The devs are issuing refunds, and waves of volume suggest traders are still watching. It’s volatile, risky, and honestly? Pretty intriguing. If this underdog keeps rebounding, Slerf could remain one of the top new meme coins to join today. Simon’s Cat (CAT): Paws Up, Game On! Who said meme coins can’t be adorable? Simon’s Cat just launched “Simon’s Cat Match,” turning its viral cartoon charm into in-game gains. Trading at ~$0.000008118 with a $56.89 million market cap, CAT’s 24-hour volume just passed $22 million. It’s the purr-fect blend of nostalgia and utility. Analysts even predict it could double in price by the end of 2025. Cute, casual, and quietly climbing—Simon’s Cat is one of the top new meme coins to join today. Conclusion: Which Bag Will You Regret Not Filling? Here’s the cold truth: based on market trends, investor buzz, and cold hard math, BTFD Coin holds the crown. The Bulls Squad is rallying, the 100% bonus LAUNCH100 offer ends March 30, and the 2900% ROI window is wide open right now—but not for long. Slerf’s trying to bounce back, and Simon’s Cat has its claws in the gaming crowd, but if you’re looking for generational wealth vibes, you know where to look. Join the BTFD Coin presale before it disappears into crypto legend. These are the top new meme coins to join today, but only one’s got Bulls backing it to the moon.

Especially with one presale so hot, it’s practically sizzling among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Let’s talk facts. Meme coin markets are exploding again. Bitcoin just brushed against $85,000, ETH’s rally turned heads, and altcoin whispers are turning into roars. But what’s cooking underneath? Meme coins are staging a comeback—with smarter mechanics, stronger communities, and real-world features. And frontlining this surge is BTFD Coin, smashing presale records, building a buzzing Bulls Squad, and dangling a limited 100% bonus offer that’s shaking up Telegram chats like never before. One of the best parts? The LAUNCH100 code that doubles your bag ends March 30, 2025. Miss that, and well… you’ll be watching others moon while you refresh CoinMarketCap with regret. Want in? You better keep reading. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Get 2x Coins, 90% APY Staking, and a Moonshot to $0.006! What if one meme coin presale could triple your returns before it even hits exchanges? That’s not clickbait—it’s BTFD Coin in its final stretch. It’s currently in Stage 15 of its presale, priced at just $0.0002, and there’s only one stage left before it lists at $0.0006. That alone offers a 200% return, but the real gold lies ahead. Let’s play with numbers: invest $4,000 today at $0.0002, and you’ll bag 20 million BTFD coins. Apply the LAUNCH100 code before March 30, and boom—you’re now holding 40 million coins. If BTFD reaches its predicted moonshot of $0.006, that turns into $240,000. That’s a staggering 2900% ROI. Yes, you read that right. And there’s more. BTFD offers staking at 90% APY—yes, 90%! That’s not some locked-away dream; it’s live, and early investors are already compounding their gains. Stake now, and by next year, your BTFD bag could multiply even further—without lifting a finger. The Bulls Squad community is buzzing, the P2E game is fully live, and players are already earning BTFD rewards as they dive through challenges with Baby Bull, Raging Bull, and the rest of the herd. Combine that with the Ethereum-based smart contract, a fixed supply, and token burns on the way—it’s no surprise experts are calling BTFD one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term. This One’s For You — Don’t Miss the 100% Bonus! Right now, BTFD is dropping a bombshell: every token you buy with the code LAUNCH100 will be doubled. This isn’t a drill. This limited BOGO-style deal vanishes on March 30, and it’s the last chance before the presale ends. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus: First, head to the BTFD Presale . Click “Connect Wallet” (MetaMask or Trust Wallet work fine). When you see the bonus field, type in LAUNCH100 (all caps), hit “Apply,” and approve it in your wallet. Now input your purchase amount, click “Buy Now,” and lock in your double reward. And don’t sleep on the referral program—if your code lands in the top 20, you’ll earn 10% of every referred purchase in $BTFD. That’s passive income done right. So why did BTFD make this list? Because it’s got the ingredients meme coin legends are made of: strong utility, viral branding, real community, and ridiculous upside. 2. COQ Inu (COQ) – Avalanche’s Wildest Ride Yet Ever seen a rooster run faster than a cheetah? That’s COQ Inu on the Avalanche chain. Born from memes and driven by raw community power, COQ has become the feathered face of Avalanche’s meme ecosystem. This isn’t just some barnyard banter—it’s pushing volume charts and attracting new traders by the thousands. Its charm lies in simplicity. COQ’s community controls everything, with token burns, liquidity locks, and meme campaigns giving it wings. It’s also taken full advantage of Avalanche’s low-fee and high-speed perks, giving memecoin traders a smoother ride than ever. COQ Inu earned its spot among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term because it’s proof that a loud, fun-loving crowd can drive serious momentum in the right direction. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – OG Meme King Plotting a Comeback? You thought SHIB was done? Think again. The original “Dogecoin killer” has been quietly preparing its next act—and this time, it’s got some heavy-hitting tools. With the Shibarium upgrade now live, gas fees are lower, speed is up, and SHIB’s ecosystem is growing. ShibaSwap has become a DeFi favorite, and token burns have started picking up again. SHIB’s recent surge in whale activity and retail chatter hints at something brewing under the surface. It’s even showing a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s latest breakout. So why is SHIB still on this list of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term? Because even after all these years, it still finds a way to sneak back into the big leagues—and this cycle could be no different. Final Thoughts – Before This Window Slams Shut… Here’s the truth most won’t tell you: Buying in the hype phase means you’re already late. That’s why presales like BTFD Coin give smart investors the chance to dodge volatility and market manipulation entirely. You’re locking in early—before whales come swimming. Whether you’re here for COQ’s energy, SHIB’s rebirth, or BTFD’s complete staking-to-gaming-to-ROI trifecta, one thing’s clear—this meme coin cycle is unlike any other. But let’s be honest—only one coin in this list is offering you double tokens, passive 90% APY rewards, and a projected 2900% return if it hits $0.006. That’s BTFD. And this opportunity doesn’t wait. So if you’re looking for the top new meme coins to buy and hold for long term, you’ve just found the ones worth betting on. But don’t just watch from the sidelines.

ETH is now consolidating and remains at risk of a downside break. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $2,050 resistance level. The price is trading below $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,040 and $2,100 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and corrected some gains, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,040 and $2,020 support levels. It tested the $1,980 zone. A low was formed at $1,982 and the price recently attempted a fresh upward move. There was a move above the $2,020 level. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,098 swing high to the $1,982 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,020 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,040 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,040 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,050 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,098 swing high to the $1,982 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,095 level. A clear move above the $2,095 resistance might send the price toward the $2,150 resistance. An upside break above the $2,150 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,250 resistance zone or even $2,320 in the near term. Downside Break In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,040 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,000 level. The first major support sits near the $1,980 zone. A clear move below the $1,980 support might push the price toward the $1,880 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,820 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,750.

Despite Ethereum’s sluggish price action, multiple on-chain indicators and technical patterns hint at an impending bullish reversal. Ethereum Retail Sentiment At Low Amid Sluggish Price Action According to cryptocurrency analyst Mister Crypto, retail interest in ETH is “extremely low,” as indicated by Google Trends data. Compared to its 2017 and 2021 peaks, Ethereum’s current sentiment ranks significantly lower, suggesting that many retail investors are sitting on the sidelines. Historically, low retail sentiment often signals a prime buying opportunity for institutional investors looking to accumulate assets before the next price surge. While weak sentiment reflects a lack of confidence among small investors, institutions tend to take advantage of such conditions, positioning themselves ahead of the next bullish cycle. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Breaking Free from the Bear Trap? Analysts Weigh In Despite the pessimism, crypto analyst Ted pointed out that the potential approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) staking and the upcoming Pectra update could serve as key catalysts for a breakout. He suggests that these developments may help Ethereum regain momentum and push its price toward new highs. Fellow analyst Crypto Patel echoed this sentiment, noting that ETH is currently consolidating within an accumulation range. Based on historical price cycles and on-chain data, Patel expects Ethereum to break out after April, with a long-term target of $10,000. Additionally, analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted a bullish crossover on Ethereum’s weekly Stochastic RSI, a signal that has historically marked market bottoms. He suggests that ETH may be nearing the end of its bearish cycle, setting the stage for a strong rally. Further Pain For ETH? Sharing a contrasting viewpoint, noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized that there has been “no change in the outlook for Ethereum.” The analyst hinted that ETH is still likely to hit the lower-end of its current price range at $1,300. However, some on-chain indicators suggest Ethereum may already be undervalued. An analysis using the Market Value to Realized Value Z-score (MVRV-Z) indicates that ETH is trading at levels historically associated with price rebounds. This metric, which compares Ethereum’s market value to its realized value, suggests that ETH might be primed for accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashing Bullish Signals, But Rising Exchange Reserves Raise Concerns – Details For Ethereum to confirm a bullish reversal, it must break through strong resistance at $2,300. A successful breakout could push ETH toward $3,000 in the short term. Failure to surpass this level, however, might result in extended consolidation or another price decline. At press time, ETH trades at $2,007, down 0.5% in the last 24 hours.

In response, the exchange fought back by suing the agency for overstepping its authority. However, in December, Crypto.com withdrew its lawsuit after President Donald Trump announced his intention to appoint pro-crypto figure Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair. Crypto.com’s Response Crypto.com’s legal troubles with the SEC began when regulators cracked down on multiple crypto firms. Unlike other exchanges that faced lawsuits or settlements, Crypto.com stood its ground, arguing that the SEC was unfairly targeting the industry. Nick Lundgren, the company’s Chief Legal Officer, called the investigation unnecessary and praised the decision to close it. He criticized the previous SEC leadership for its aggressive stance against crypto, saying it forced the industry into legal battles rather than providing clear regulations. With this case closed, Crypto.com remains one of the few global crypto exchanges that have avoided penalties or legal action from U.S. regulators. Crypto.com’s Compliance Record Stands Strong Throughout its legal fight, Crypto.com has maintained a strong compliance track record. The exchange has secured over 100 regulatory approvals worldwide and continues to operate within strict financial guidelines. This includes approvals from U.S. financial watchdogs, making it one of the most regulated platforms in the industry. With the SEC case behind it, Crypto.com is now focused on working with regulators to shape fairer policies for the crypto industry.

Ripple, which faced accusations from the SEC regarding its sale of XRP tokens, has now emerged victorious, as the judge ruled in favor of Ripple multiple times. The SEC’s decision to appeal earlier this year in January, even after the resignation of former chairman Gary Gensler, frustrated many, including Ripple. However, with the dismissal of the appeal, the legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple has now officially ended. Following the dismissal of the appeal, excitement surged in the crypto market, with XRP’s value experiencing a notable uptick. Despite this positive development for Ripple, enthusiasts are still awaiting a formal confirmation from the SEC. As of March 28, 2025, the SEC has officially announced the dismissal of litigation against several other companies, including Kraken, ConsenSys, and Cumberland, but has not yet made a statement on the Ripple case. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, the SEC’s current focus is on addressing the procedural requirements for lifting the standard injunction imposed by Judge Torres, which has delayed the official end to the case. No @Ripple here but I’m not entirely surprised because, again, it is slightly different to these other cases in that (as @s_alderoty mentioned in his post) the SEC now has to go to the Southern District and ask Judge Torres to lift the standard injunction.

A vote by the SEC Commission is expected in less than 30 days. Once that happens, Ripple will not oppose the motion to lift the injunction, and Judge Torres will likely sign off on it. All of this means that within 60 days, Ripple’s legal battles with the SEC could be fully and formally resolved.

Popcat and Mog Coin have each made a splash with viral growth and big early gains, mostly fueled by humor and internet trends. Popcat leaned into the love for a classic meme, while Mog Coin tapped into the internet’s cat craze to build its momentum. But then there’s Dragoin ($DDGN) —a project with a twist. It offers more than just laughs or quick flips. Dragoin is shaping a full-on fantasy world where the presale is part of a bigger journey. It’s not just about buying a coin—it’s about being part of a growing legend. Popcat (POPCAT): Riding the Meme Wave to Big Returns Popcat (POPCAT) launched in late 2023 on Solana, and it wasted no time going viral. Based on the well-known “Pop Cat” meme, it skipped the usual presale, giving everyone an equal shot from day one. Solana’s fast, low-cost network helped the token take off quickly. The result? A massive 23,300% surge from launch to its peak in early 2024. As of March 24, 2025, POPCAT is trading at $0.2323, up 10.6% in the last 24 hours and 16.5% over the week. That’s still 88.7% down from its high, but early buyers remain well in the green. With nearly 980 million tokens in circulation and a $226 million market cap, Popcat is still going strong on Solana. It’s proof that humor, speed, and community can still go a long way in the meme coin space. Mog Coin (MOG): No Presale, Just Pure Community Power Mog Coin (MOG) made its debut in July 2023 on Ethereum. No presale, no venture funding—just memes and a loyal community. What started as a cat-themed token built real traction through word of mouth. That momentum eventually earned MOG a place on Coinbase’s roadmap and helped push the price to a high of $0.000004022 in December 2024. Fast forward to March 24, 2025: MOG is trading at $0.00000054, up 15.05% in 24 hours and 12.63% over the week. That’s still 86.6% below its top, but it’s up an incredible 11,807.2% since its 2023 low. With a $209 million market cap and more than 390 trillion tokens in circulation, MOG has proven that community energy and a good meme can still deliver big results—even without a big budget. Dragoin’s Presale Feels Like a Fantasy—and It Comes with Real Potential Dragoin ($DDGN) isn’t just here to join the meme coin race—it’s adding a new layer to it. The project is rolling out a 25-stage presale, and each one is named after major fantasy events, taking inspiration from series like Game of Thrones. But it’s not just clever names—each stage brings its own rewards and unique ways to engage. It all starts with Stage 1, “The Fall of Valyria.” Beyond the name, it’s Dragoin’s most affordable entry point. Like the fall of an empire in fiction, this moment marks the beginning of Dragoin’s rise. For early buyers, it’s a chance to grab tokens before the price moves up with each new round. More than anything, Dragoin is inviting people to be part of the journey. It’s not just about holding tokens—it’s about joining a community that grows stage by stage. As the presale continues, so do the rewards and engagement. The longer you stay in, the more involved you become. Why Dragoin Might Offer Something More Meaningful Popcat and Mog Coin have both shown how far a meme and an active crowd can go. They delivered big for early investors and sparked strong online support. They’ve also proven that even in a sea of tokens, a fun idea and good timing can still win. But Dragoin ($DDGN) is offering a different route. With a presale that doubles as a storyline, play-to-earn potential, and a focus on decentralization, it aims to do more than entertain. It wants to build something lasting. Every phase of the presale is a step in an unfolding tale—and that makes the investment feel like more than just a trade. For those thinking beyond short-term gains, Dragoin could be where the real story begins.

Every week brings fresh momentum for select coins, sparking interest among smart market watchers. These aren’t just rising in value—they’re also showing signs of strong future growth. For anyone tracking the next big move, now is the time to dig deeper into a few standout names. Among the best-performing cryptos are BlockDAG, Polkadot, Near Protocol, and XRP. These names are gaining traction for both daily trading and long-term potential. With active communities and steady development, they’re attracting attention in today’s market. Here’s a closer look at why they could be key players in 2025. BlockDAG (BDAG): Fast Transactions Speed and Huge ROI Potential BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly earning a spot among the best-performing cryptos in 2025. Known for its high speed and ability to scale, BlockDAG can support large DeFi platforms and handle heavy transaction loads without issues. It also places strong focus on safety, using advanced cryptography to protect data and block harmful actions. With this secure and growing system, more people are turning to BlockDAG over other options. The project’s presale has now passed $207 million, with plans to reach $600 million soon. BDAG’s price has jumped from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0248 in batch 27—a 2,380% rise. With its mainnet launch and 10 exchange listings coming up, interest in BDAG coins is likely to increase even more. Experts predict BDAG could hit $1 in 2025 and possibly reach $30 by 2030, thanks to its steady presale progress and strong outlook. For those aiming at long-term gains, buying at the current low price might offer one of the best chances to benefit from future growth. Polkadot (DOT): Linking Different Chains in One Place Polkadot focuses on connecting different blockchain systems under one structure. Instead of being separate, chains on Polkadot can share information and tools. This boosts performance across the full network. A key part of its design is the parachain auctions, where new chains compete for limited spots, which raises the project’s quality overall. With more parachains set to go live in 2025, excitement is growing for Polkadot. These updates could support both higher use and price gains. Those looking for value in a busy market may find Polkadot’s approach and expanding reach worth paying attention to. It holds steady among the best-performing cryptos. Near Protocol (NEAR): Quick, Cheap, and Developer-Focused Near Protocol stays relevant due to its fast speed, low costs, and expanding use cases. It handles more users without slowing down, thanks to its special structure called sharding. This makes Near more efficient than others that get clogged up as users increase. Backed by a $100 million fund and more activity from developers, Near could see major gains soon. As more users demand quicker and affordable platforms, Near is well placed to grow. It stands as one of the best-performing cryptos for upcoming growth. Ripple (XRP): Still Active Despite Legal Uncertainty Ripple (XRP) remains among the best-performing cryptos due to its global payments role and ongoing case with the SEC. Even with legal delays, XRP draws attention from both traders and institutions. Ripple’s system is still used by banks and firms for fast money transfers, keeping it relevant. If Ripple gets a good result in court, it could lift XRP’s price and use in a big way. Through all the ups and downs, its place in the money-transfer space gives XRP long-term promise. Best Performing Cryptos in 2025— Final Words! Each of these best-performing cryptos brings something different to the table. Polkadot gives solid cross-chain features, Near Protocol delivers speed and low fees, and XRP is strong in payment use—each has potential for the future. But only one shows signs of much larger returns. BlockDAG has already crossed $207 million in presale funds with over 18.9 billion coins sold. The current price of $0.0248 in batch 27 has experts saying $1 in 2025 is realistic, and even $30 by 2030. These signs make BDAG stand out clearly from the rest of the best-performing cryptos .

According to a Mar. 27 announcement on Circle’s official blog, the demand for stablecoins has been rising despite market volatility. Stablecoins have found a strong product-market fit in both the web3 and traditional finance sectors. However, many companies struggle to set up stablecoin transactions due to technical and compliance hurdles. USDCKit will help remove these barriers by providing large-scale payment processing, automated fund transfers, and integrated regulatory tools. Any business that handles large amounts of USD Coin ( USDC ) transactions could benefit, even though payment service providers and remittance platforms will probably be the first users. USDCKit will also facilitate the smooth transfer of USDC between networks by supporting several blockchains, such as Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ).

GameStop (GME) short sales volume — the total number of shares sold short within a specific timeframe — rose 234% over 24 hours, reaching 30.85 million shares sold on March 27, according to TradingView data. The SSR kicks in when a stock drops over 10% from the previous day’s closing price. GameStop’s stock fell 22% over the trading day, wiping out its 12% gain from the Bitcoin announcement and then some, according to Google Finance data. At the time of publication, GME was trading at $22.09. GameStop shorts volume near 2021 short squeeze levels The rule is applied for the rest of the trading day and the following trading day. Malone Wealth president and CEO Kevin Malone said in a March 27 X post that “GameStop traded 50x more shares today than last Thursday. Not statistically possible without naked short-selling.” GameStop’s short sale volume reached 30.88 million on March 27. Source: TradingView The number is close to the levels reached in January 2021 when GameStop stocks famously went meteoric after a “short squeeze” of the stock, causing significant losses for hedge funds and other short sellers while some retail traders made significant returns. The highest point reached during that month was 33.26 million shares on Jan. 19. GameStop Bitcoin buy is “dot-comish” GameStop did not specify how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase, but after the markets closed on March 26, the firm announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering . However, some analysts and commentators have questioned GameStop’s plan to start purchasing Bitcoin. Speaking to Yahoo Finance on March 27, Tastylive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff said that GameStop's decision to buy Bitcoin feels “a little dot-comish” to him. Source: Hans Akamatsu “It feels a little like, oh, I’m going to throw a dot com at the end of my name, I’m going to buy some Bitcoin with our excess cash because we can’t find a company that is going to be accretive,” Sosnoff said. Meanwhile, Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro , told Reuters on March 27 that “investors are not necessarily optimistic on the underlying business.” Biggest day of short sales still goes to Keith Gill’s return The biggest day of short sales still belongs to June 3, 2024, when it reached 46.20 million. This was around the time Keith Gill, a stock trader known for the GameStop short squeeze in 2021, revealed on June 2 that he had started trading GameStop stock again, this time with $180 million to play with. Related: Firms without business models ‘buy Bitcoin’ — Angel investor Jason Calacanis GameStop said the convertible senior notes — debt that can later be converted into equity — will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquiring Bitcoin. Some analysts see the convertible notes offering announcement as the reason for the stock’s decline. Han Akamatsu said in a March 27 X post that GameStop’s stock is dropping for the same reason Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) declined after issuing convertible notes. “In 2021, MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes, the stock dipped after the announcement due to hedging shorts, but later exploded when Bitcoin ripped and the arbitrage unspooled,” Akamatsu said, adding: “GME is following the same blueprint now ...If GME or BTC goes up a lot, the trade gets very interesting as we have a squeeze opportunity here.” Magazine: Arbitrum co-founder skeptical of move to based and native rollups: Steven Goldfeder This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.35 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.3850 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.478 swing high to the $2.301 low. The next resistance is $2.420. A clear move above the $2.420 resistance might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance or even $2.550 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.620. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.40 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.30 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level.

42513487,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144091,1743137750,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI Agent Automates Qonto Invoice Retrieval: A Game-Changer for Businesses,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-agent-qonto-invoice-automation/,"Are you tired of spending countless hours wrestling with invoices? Imagine a world where this tedious task is handled automatically, freeing up your valuable time to focus on what truly matters – growing your business. Paris-based startup Twin is turning this vision into reality with its groundbreaking AI agent , and their first mission is to revolutionize invoice management for Qonto’s 500,000+ European customers. What Makes Twin’s AI Agent a Game-Changer for Invoice Automation? In a landscape buzzing with automation solutions, Twin is carving a unique path. While traditional methods like API integrations, no-code platforms, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have their place, Twin believes there’s a smarter, more efficient way forward. Their secret weapon? Artificial Intelligence, specifically, sophisticated AI agents designed to learn and adapt like humans, but with the speed and precision of machines. Let’s break down why Twin’s approach to invoice automation is generating buzz: Beyond Traditional RPA: RPA often relies on rigid scripts that break when website layouts change. Twin’s AI agent , powered by OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, navigates websites dynamically, adapting to changes on the fly. Scalability and Breadth: Forget custom scripts for every website. Twin’s Invoice Operator is designed to handle the “long tail” of online services – thousands upon thousands – making it incredibly scalable for businesses dealing with diverse vendors. User-Friendly Simplicity: No coding skills or complex configurations are needed. Twin prioritizes ease of use. Even non-tech-savvy users can launch Invoice Operator, log into their accounts, and let the AI agent take over. Invoice Operator: How Does This AI Agent Actually Work with Qonto? Twin’s debut product, Invoice Operator, is specifically tailored for Qonto users. Qonto, a leading fintech providing business bank accounts, understands the invoice pain point intimately. Millions of invoices flow through their platform monthly, and businesses often spend precious hours manually collecting and uploading these documents. Invoice Operator steps in to streamline this process. Here’s a glimpse into its workflow: Transaction Analysis: The agent starts by identifying Qonto transactions that are missing invoices. Intelligent Service Access: Invoice Operator presents a list of services it needs to access to retrieve invoices, alongside a window showcasing the agent’s actions in real-time. Secure Credential Input: For services requiring login, the agent pauses and prompts the user to manually enter credentials, ensuring security and user control. Automated Retrieval and Attachment: Once authorized, the AI agent intelligently navigates to find past transactions, download invoices as PDFs, and automatically attach them to the corresponding transactions within the user’s Qonto account. Imagine the hours saved, the reduced errors, and the newfound efficiency – all thanks to this intelligent invoice automation tool. Why is Twin Betting on Computer-Using Agents? Hugo Mercier, Twin’s co-founder and CEO, highlights the limitations of existing automation approaches. He points out that RPA requires custom scripts for each website, becoming a maintenance nightmare as websites evolve. API-based solutions like Zapier, while powerful, take years to integrate with thousands of applications. Twin’s embrace of Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) offers a compelling alternative. Here’s why CUAs are poised to be the future of automation: Feature RPA API Automation (e.g., Zapier) Computer-Using Agents (Twin) Website Change Adaptation Requires script modification Not applicable (API-based) Adapts dynamically Scalability across Services Limited, script per website Extensive, but slow integration Highly scalable, broad service coverage Ease of Use for End-Users Can be complex, often requires technical expertise User-friendly, but limited to API integrations Designed for simplicity, no coding needed Development Speed Slow, script development per website Moderate, API integration dependent Rapid, leverages AI learning Twin’s early success with Invoice Operator, supporting thousands of applications within months, underscores the potential of CUAs. Being among the first to leverage OpenAI’s CUA model in beta gives them a significant head start in this exciting field. Beyond Invoices: What’s Next for AI-Powered Business Automation? While Invoice Operator is focused on Qonto and invoice retrieval, Twin envisions a much broader future for B2B AI agents. They believe that agentic applications can transform various industries and business processes. Imagine business automation extending to: E-commerce Order Management: Agents automatically handling orders, tracking shipments, and managing inventory. Marketplace Catalog Classification: Agents intelligently categorizing and tagging products, ensuring accurate and efficient catalog management. Call Center Support: Agents retrieving information and providing real-time assistance to call center representatives, improving customer service and efficiency. Twin’s vision is clear: AI agents are poised to become faster, cheaper, and more accurate, revolutionizing how businesses operate. The question now is whether Twin can transform their core agent platform into a developer-friendly product, empowering others to build their own agent-powered applications.

A recent analysis from CryptoQuant provides a closer look at how top crypto have performed in terms of market cap and drawdowns over the past several months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend, But Analyst Warns Of Strong Resistance Ahead BNB, XRP, and Ethereum Show Diverging Trends One of the most notable shifts has been Binance Coin (BNB) reclaiming its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. BNB’s market cap rose to approximately $92 billion, surpassing Solana (SOL), which now sits at $74 billion. This shift follows a strong rally in SOL during late 2024, largely fueled by growth in its meme coin ecosystem. However, the attention of speculative activity appears to have transitioned toward the BNB Chain, where similar crypto ecosystem momentum has helped support its recovery. Another significant market cap development involves XRP. According to CryptoQuant, XRP’s market capitalization increased substantially following the 2024 US presidential election. Market Cap Evolution of Top Cryptocurrencies BNB and Bitcoin are currently experiencing the lowest drawdowns among this group, each down approximately 20% from their all-time highs, indicating relatively strong price performance and resilience. pic.twitter.com/dW3tXlvSMG — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 From a valuation of $30 billion in early November, XRP’s market cap climbed to $141 billion by March 2025. The timing of this rise appears to align with the outcome of the US election, which some believe could potentially influence regulatory sentiment around crypto assets. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) has faced a more challenging trajectory. After peaking in late 2024, ETH’s market capitalization declined by 50% to around $240 billion as of March 2025. This sharp drop highlights the current volatility in the altcoin market and raises questions about Ethereum’s ability to maintain its prior valuation levels amid shifting macro and sector-specific factors. Crypto Price Resilience and Drawdown Metrics CryptoQuant’s report also evaluated drawdowns—the decline from an asset’s all-time high—as a measure of relative performance. Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB emerged as the most resilient assets among the group, each down approximately 20% from their respective all-time highs. BNB’s stability has been linked to its continued utility within the Binance ecosystem, including usage for transaction fees and platform-related activities. Meanwhile, ETH and SOL have struggled to recover from deeper drawdowns. Both assets are currently more than 50% below their previous peaks, highlighting higher levels of volatility and reduced investor momentum.

Ex-SEC Lawyer Clarifies appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After four long years of legal battles, the fight between Ripple and the SEC has finally come to a halt. The legal showdown that has drawn attention from both the crypto community and financial regulators appears to be over, but some lingering questions remain. Despite a statement from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, XRP supporters are still waiting for official confirmation from the SEC itself. Amid ongoing speculation, a document recently circulated online claiming that the SEC will not make an official announcement about the lawsuit until August 7. However, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel quickly dismissed the document, stating, “This is stupid and wrong. You’re welcome!” Others pointed out that the document in question was from last summer, further fueling doubts about its validity. Lawyer dropping by to say: this is stupid and wrong. You’re welcome! — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 28, 2025 Just last week, the SEC decided to drop its appeal without any conditions. In return, Ripple has agreed to drop its cross-appeal. As part of the settlement, the SEC will keep $50 million of the $125 million fine, which is already held in an interest-bearing escrow account. The remaining balance will be returned to Ripple. Additionally, the SEC should ask the court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request. However, this process isn’t immediate. Before the injunction can be lifted, the SEC must first vote on the decision, and then Judge Torres must be asked to lift it. This will likely happen in the coming weeks, All of this is still subject to a Commission vote, the drafting of final documents, and the usual court processes.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 05:05:48

DOGE is declining and might test the $0.180 support zone. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.1980 and $0.1920 levels. The price is trading above the $0.180 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.1950 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1940 and $0.1980 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $0.2050, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.1980 and $0.1920 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1665 swing low to the $0.2057 high. There was also a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.1950 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.180 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1920 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1980 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2050 level. A close above the $0.2050 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2150 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2220 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2350. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1920 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1860 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1665 swing low to the $0.2057 high. The next major support is near the $0.1820 level. The main support sits at $0.1750. If there is a downside break below the $0.1750 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.170 level or even $0.1650 in the near term.

The lawsuit was officially dismissed in a joint stipulation between the crypto exchange and the South Carolina Attorney General’s securities division on March 27. “South Carolina just joined Vermont to dismiss its unfounded staking lawsuit against Coinbase,” the firm’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, said in a March 27 X post. “This is not just a victory for us, but for American consumers and we hope it's a sign of things to come in the few states left that restrict staking.” South Carolina Attorney General and Coinbase’s joint stipulation. Source: South Carolina Attorney General South Carolina and Vermont were two of 10 US states that took legal action against Coinbase's staking services on June 6, 2023 — the same day that the federal securities regulator filed its lawsuit against the crypto exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission officially dismissed that lawsuit on Feb. 27, 2025. The other eight US states that filed enforcement action similar to South Carolina were Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin. Grewal said he hoped to see other states follow suit, and that South Carolina residents lost an estimated $2 million in staking rewards as a result of the lawsuit. “The 52 million Americans who own crypto deserve commonsense consumer protections and clear rules,” he said. “We applaud South Carolina for standing up for justice and hope the remaining states with bans on staking will take notice.” South Carolina introduces Bitcoin reserve bill Meanwhile, a state lawmaker has just introduced the “Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act of South Carolina” on March 27, which could see the state treasurer allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ). Unlike most US state crypto reserve bills, North Carolina’s House Bill 4256, introduced by Rep. Jordan Pace, mentioned Bitcoin on several occasions for the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve that the bill seeks to establish. Source: Jordan Pace The bill allows South Carolina’s treasurer, currently Curtis Loftis, to establish a Bitcoin reserve that exceeds no more than 1 million Bitcoin — a high ceiling that the US federal government is also looking to reach or exceed with its recently established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The treasurer would be able to add Bitcoin to South Carolina’s General Fund, the Budget Stabilization Reserve Fund any other investment fund that they manage. Related: Coinbase files FOIA to see how much the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ cost While no mention of stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, Ether ( ETH ) or any other crypto tokens was made, the House bill said the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve wouldn’t be limited to Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin Law, 42 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced at the state level in 19 states, and 36 of those 42 bills remain live. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

While this technology already helps safeguard Coinbase assets, we’re raising the bar for security across the industry by making it… — Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) March 27, 2025 With the code now available on GitHub, developers and organizations can easily integrate MPC into their security systems. Coinbase hopes to promote the industry’s wider adoption of state-of-the-art security features by open-sourcing these tools. The company has also launched a bug bounty program for security researchers to help identify errors in the code.

It currently supports over 430 assets for custody and 250 for trading. Improving security continues to be its top priority as more institutions adopt Coinbase Prime for safe transactions and custody. Coinbase Institutional’s latest move coincides with the rapid surge in cyberattacks against the crypto industry. In the first quarter alone, hackers stole $1.64 billion, making it the worst quarter for security breaches in history, according to Immunefi’s Q1 2025 report . 94% of all losses were on centralized platforms. The Bybit hack alone accounted for $1.53 billion, making it the biggest exploit in crypto history. Ethereum ( ETH ) and BNB Chain ( BNB ) were the main targets for on-chain exploits, with 15 and 19 attacks, respectively. Only $6.5 million, or 0.4% of the total funds stolen in Q1, has been recovered so far. Coinbase’s move to make its MPC library open-source may be a step toward improved security measures for the sector as hackers become more sophisticated.

In a blog post on Mar. 27, the exchange revealed the news, pointing out that it had previously received a Wells notice from the SEC before suing the agency in October 2024. The lawsuit, which claimed the SEC had overstepped its authority, was later dismissed in December. The investigation has now ended with no penalties. Nick Lundgren, Crypto.com’s Chief Legal Officer, welcomed the decision, stating: “We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com with no enforcement action or settlement,” He criticized the previous SEC leadership, claiming the agency had misused its power to target the crypto industry.

The blockchain payments firm recently announced a partnership with African fintech platform Chipper Cash to facilitate crypto-enabled cross-border payments across the continent. At the same time, cryptocurrency index fund manager Bitwise has published a new long-term forecast suggesting XRP’s price could reach as high as $29 by 2030 if the token gains significant traction in the payments and asset tokenization sectors. Ripple Partners With Chipper Cash to Power Crypto-Enabled Cross-Border Payments in Africa Blockchain payments firm Ripple has announced a strategic partnership with African payment infrastructure provider Chipper Cash, marking another significant move in its mission to revolutionize global remittance corridors. According to a March 27 press release, Chipper Cash will leverage Ripple’s crypto-enabled payment solution, Ripple Payments, to facilitate cross-border transactions across key African markets. The companies said the alliance is designed to address some of the most pressing challenges in the African payments landscape — particularly the high cost, slow speed, and lack of transparency often associated with cross-border money transfers. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized the importance of the partnership in Ripple's broader strategy to deepen its presence on the continent. This partnership is an important step in Ripple’s expansion in Africa, Merrick said. Chipper Cash, one of Africa’s leading financial technology companies, operates in over 20 countries and is widely regarded as a major player in driving financial inclusion on the continent. Co-founder and CEO Ham Serunjogi underscored the impact crypto-enabled solutions can have in reducing the cost and complexity of cross-border transactions. “Crypto-enabled payments have the potential to enable greater financial inclusion, accelerate access to global markets, and empower businesses and individuals across Africa,” Serunjogi stated. He added that integrating Ripple’s technology into Chipper Cash's platform will allow their customers “to receive payments faster and at lower cost.” The partnership with Chipper Cash builds upon Ripple’s previous initiatives in the region. In late 2023, Ripple inked a deal with African fintech Onafriq, enabling payments between 27 African countries and international markets such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Chipper Cash collaboration is another example of Ripple’s focus on emerging economies where blockchain adoption is accelerating, particularly in the payments and remittance sectors. A recent report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis highlighted that stablecoins now account for nearly half of all transaction volume in Sub-Saharan Africa — a clear sign of the region’s growing interest in digital asset solutions. Further supporting this trend, a late 2024 industry report projected that several African economies could evolve into key digital asset hubs, fueled by increasing crypto adoption, a young digital-savvy population, and an urgent need for accessible financial infrastructure. Africa remains one of the most expensive regions in the world for sending money. According to World Bank data, the average cost of sending remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa is around 8%, compared to the global average of 6.2%. Blockchain-based payment networks like Ripple aim to address these inefficiencies, making cross-border transactions faster, more transparent, and considerably cheaper. Merrick noted that the growing adoption of blockchain technology in remittances is a natural response to the market’s inefficiencies. “By integrating our technology into Chipper Cash’s platform, we’re enabling faster, more affordable cross-border payments while driving economic growth and innovation across the markets they serve,” he said. Ripple’s Global Expansion Continues The partnership comes amid a series of strategic wins for Ripple globally. Earlier in March, the company secured a payments license in Dubai, allowing it to offer cryptocurrency-powered payment solutions in the United Arab Emirates — a critical gateway between Europe, Asia, and Africa. Ripple's momentum follows a major legal victory in its prolonged battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The court’s favorable decision has provided regulatory clarity, enabling Ripple to confidently expand its services without the shadow of legal uncertainty. The Ripple-Chipper Cash partnership is being welcomed by industry observers as another significant step in unlocking the potential of blockchain technology in developing economies. Financial inclusion advocates and crypto analysts alike have long argued that blockchain could reshape financial infrastructure across Africa, where traditional banking access remains limited and cross-border payments are costly and inefficient. While Ripple and Chipper Cash have yet to provide further details on rollout timelines or target corridors, the move underscores a broader trend: Africa’s payment infrastructure is rapidly evolving, and crypto is playing an increasingly central role. Bitwise Predicts XRP Could Soar to $29 by 2030 in Max Bullish Scenario Meanwhile, in a report that is turning heads across the crypto industry, cryptocurrency index fund manager Bitwise Asset Management has unveiled a range of long-term price scenarios for the XRP token, projecting that the asset could potentially soar to $29.32 by 2030 in what it calls its ”max scenario.” Bitwise’s ambitious forecast, released earlier this week, is based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and factors in XRP’s potential market share in two critical sectors: cross-border payments and real-world asset tokenization. The firm argues that even a modest penetration into these trillion-dollar markets could propel XRP’s market capitalization to levels previously unimaginable — surpassing even the likes of Microsoft’s current market cap. In its most optimistic projection, Bitwise estimates that XRP’s market capitalization could grow to $2.9 trillion by the end of the decade. At that valuation, each XRP token would be worth $29.32, positioning the digital asset alongside the world's largest corporations in terms of financial weight. Bitwise’s report outlines the conditions necessary for this “max scenario” to play out, highlighting the need for XRP to capture a ”meaningful” share of the rapidly expanding payments market and the booming asset tokenization sector. In particular, tokenization — the process of converting real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain — is seen as a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. While the $29 projection is eye-catching, Bitwise has also presented two alternative scenarios: Bull Scenario: In a moderately optimistic case, XRP could climb to $12.70 by 2030 if the network maintains steady growth and faces minimal regulatory or technological obstacles. However, in this scenario, XRP would fail to capture substantial market share in payments or tokenization, relying instead on incremental adoption and usage. Bear Scenario: On the other end of the spectrum, Bitwise warns that XRP could plummet to $0.13 if it fails to secure institutional adoption and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem struggles to attract users. Such an outcome would represent a near-total collapse of XRP's value. Looking ahead, one of the key catalysts that could potentially ignite XRP’s momentum is the approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States — a development that appears increasingly likely. Bitwise itself filed for an XRP ETF in October 2024, and analysts expect other financial heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity to follow suit. According to crypto market analyst Nate Geraci, XRP’s inclusion in the ETF landscape is “almost inevitable” now that the regulatory clouds have cleared. An XRP ETF would make the token more accessible to institutional and retail investors alike, potentially driving substantial inflows into the asset. Tokenization, Payments, and the XRP Ecosystem Bitwise’s price projections are based on the belief that XRP is uniquely positioned to benefit from two powerful trends: the rise of blockchain-powered cross-border payments and the tokenization of real-world assets. Ripple has already made significant strides in the payments sector, recently expanding its payment network in Africa through a partnership with fintech firm Chipper Cash. Additionally, Ripple’s growing presence in tokenization initiatives is aligned with its broader mission to create seamless, blockchain-based financial infrastructure. However, Bitwise cautions that the road ahead is uncertain. The adoption of XRP in these sectors depends on regulatory clarity, technological advancements, and Ripple’s ability to onboard institutional clients at scale.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 05:30:00

While SHIB and PEPE continue to ride waves of social hype, large holders appear to be prioritizing utility and long-term upside. Remittix, currently in presale, has delivered over 300% returns for early investors and is quickly gaining momentum as the top crypto whales look for the best crypto to invest in . On-Chain Data Shows Massive Drop in SHIB Whale Inflows Shiba Inu has recently recorded a decent uptrend, posting an 11.4% gain in under a week and sparking excitement among investors. From a low of $0.00001280 on March 21 to a peak of $0.00001550 by March 26, SHIB looked like it was clawing its way back into the spotlight. Even now, it’s holding ground above $0.00001400 , a level that many see as key to sustaining momentum. But beneath the surface, the picture isn’t so pretty. Whale activity—the lifeblood of sustained rallies in meme coins—is drying up fast. Over the past month, large SHIB transactions have plummeted by 70% . Even more alarming, whale outflows have dropped 73%, and inflows are down 85%. This kind of drop-off tells a clear story: the big money is stepping away. The crucial support at $0.000012 is now in focus. If SHIB loses that footing, analysts warn that a slide to $0.000010 is likely. Trader sentiment is mixed. While some, like ‘ World Of Charts ,’ point to a potential breakout from a descending channel, others argue the recent gains are more of a temporary bounce than a trend shift. Either way, the fact remains—those with the most skin in the game seem to be taking profits and reallocating. And where is that capital flowing? Not back into SHIB . It’s being redirected to newer projects with stronger narratives, practical use cases, and cleaner tokenomics. Investors Question Whether Pepe Can Sustain Momentum Pepe Coin has made headlines once again, but not all for bullish reasons. On March 27, 2025, a newly created wallet pulled 500 billion PEPE —roughly $4.3 million—from Binance, sparking debate across the trading community. While some initially saw this as whale accumulation, deeper analysis suggests a different trend may be forming. With PEPE trading at $0.000008521 and volume surging past $668 million, the optics look strong on the surface. But the timing of this withdrawal is raising eyebrows. Despite breaking above the 50-day EMA and climbing 10.4% in the past week, on-chain signals show that whales may be using these mini-pumps to exit rather than accumulate. Large-scale movements like the Binance withdrawal are increasingly viewed as redistributions rather than long-term commitments. Traders watching PEPE closely have noted that similar price spikes have led to dumps in the past, and the current lack of sustained accumulation reinforces that narrative. The current price uptick to $0.0000085 is notable, but without consistent whale support, this momentum could fade fast. In fact, some analysts believe the recent rally is more of a trap for retail investors than a signal of continued bullish growth. PEPE’s meme coin appeal keeps it volatile and popular, but recent trends suggest big players may be offloading on strength while shifting focus to fundamentally stronger alternatives. As SHIB and PEPE whales quietly rotate capital into projects with real utility, one rising token is catching their attention—and this time, it’s not just hype driving the interest. Crypto Whales Bet on Remittix as Best Crypto to Invest In While many crypto whales have used recent price spikes in Shiba Inu and Pepe to exit their positions, a surprising amount of capital is flowing into a lesser-known project— Remittix (RTX) . This Ethereum-based altcoin has quickly gained traction during its presale, delivering over 300% gains for early participants. Unlike meme coins driven by hype, Remittix is rooted in solving a real problem: cross-border payments. Its PayFi infrastructure enables fast, low-fee international transactions that convert crypto to fiat in minutes. At the heart of the Remittix surge is its DeFi-native RTX token, which powers a payment system designed for both individuals and businesses seeking alternatives to traditional banking bottlenecks. Its appeal has been magnified by a fully audited smart contract, with BlockSAFU confirming its security protocols. For investors burned by rug pulls or speculative plays, this is a reassuring differentiator. With tokens still priced at $0.0734, investors view this as a ground-floor opportunity. Analysts forecast as much as 30x returns once the token lists on major exchanges. As the memecoin craze shows signs of slowing, whales appear to be making a calculated shift—exchanging hype for long-term potential. Right now, Remittix is where that narrative is unfolding.

The bank will focus on small, newly created tokens developed by French teams and may also support their listings on exchanges. State-owned French investment bank Bpifrance has unveiled a €25m fund to directly invest in emerging French crypto assets. The decision falls under the bank’s ongoing efforts to nurture the experimentation of blockchain technologies and the growth of the digital asset market in France. Arnaud Caudoux, the deputy CEO of Bpifrance, explained that the goal was clearly to accelerate the crypto industry. The public investment bank, which has invested over €150M in the crypto sector over the past 10 years, plans to accelerate its investment and spend roughly the same amount over the next four years. 💥BREAKING: 🇫🇷 FRENCH STATE-OWNED BANK BPIFRANCE LAUNCHES €25M FUND FOR NEW FRENCH CRYPTO TOKENS BANKING FOMO IS HERE 🚀 pic.twitter.com/1j5T9nCJyt — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) March 27, 2025 Bpifrance has taken stock after 10 years of investing in the crypto industry, and it’s quite positive. Caudoux confirmed this Thursday that the results were there despite some of the ups and downs specific to this industry. The institution has supported approximately 200 blockchain startups since 2014, injecting more than €150 million through partner funds, as well as direct equity investments of €15 million. Caudoux noted that, with the exception of a few cases, all Bpifrance crypto projects were still active, and most were experiencing strong growth. He insisted that it was time to accelerate France’s crypto venture in the context of a dynamic U.S. In this context, Bpifrance has, therefore, decided to double its investment by 2029, diversifying its financing tools: loans, equity investments, and now token investments. “Instead of purchasing large cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the fund will be targeted towards buying smaller newly-created tokens issued by French projects, before they are listed on crypto exchanges.” – Arnaud Caudoux Clara Chappaz, France’s Minister Delegate in charge of AI and Digital, said Bpifrance’s initiative strongly signals its determination to make France a country of excellence for these technologies. France joins the U.S. in reviving crypto interest among investors According to Reuters, interest in crypto has revived globally since President Trump’s election win in November. Trump has expressed support for the industry, sought to overhaul policies, and even launched his own crypto products. However, European finance ministers are concerned that the U.S. embrace of crypto could affect eurozone monetary sovereignty and financial stability. Caudoux said that U.S. policies were attracting crypto companies to move there. He added that Europe had great engineers and great companies, and ‘we want to keep those companies here because we strongly believe that it is very important in the future to have our own ecosystem.’ Caudoux also asserted that Bpifrance will continue with its lending activity, but it will focus on equity investments and tokens, following the successful experiences with Morpho and Aleph. Bpifrance has since exited Aleph but still holds its Morpho tokens. Bpifrance’s plan provides for a balanced allocation with €100 million in direct investments, €100 million in indirect investments via partner funds (Cathay Ledger in particular), and a €25 million envelope dedicated to tokens. Caudoux explained that Bpifrance could not yet create a token fund due to regulatory reasons, so the bank was planning to make investments as they arose, and they would be included on Bpifrance’s balance sheet. A few days ago, Chappaz announced her intention to take measures to continue supporting the French sector from a regulatory and financial perspective. She said she will bring together crypto stakeholders in April to assess the state of the sector and ensure that France was ‘always a place of choice’.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s sending ripples through the digital asset space. Get ready for a fresh wave of trading opportunities as Binance unveils the listing of not one, but four brand-new crypto tokens! Let’s dive into the details of this surprising development and explore what it means for the market. What’s the Buzz About These New Crypto Tokens on Binance? In a move that highlights the power of community engagement, Binance has announced the listing of Mubarak (MUBARAK), CZ’SDog (BROCCOLI714), Tutorial (TUT), and BananaForScale (BANANAS31). These tokens are the chosen ones, emerging victorious from Binance’s innovative “vote to list” process. This initiative allows the Binance community to directly influence which projects get listed on the platform, adding a layer of decentralization to the listing process itself. The official announcement, posted on Binance’s website, confirms that trading for these tokens will commence promptly at 9 p.m. (UTC) today. This rapid listing following the vote underscores Binance’s commitment to swiftly responding to community preferences and expanding its diverse ecosystem of tradable assets. Decoding the “Vote to List” Process: How Did These Tokens Make the Cut? Binance’s “vote to list” mechanism is designed to empower its users. Here’s a breakdown of how it typically works: Community Nomination: Projects interested in being listed on Binance can be nominated and put forward for consideration. Voting Rounds: Binance users who hold a certain amount of BNB (Binance Coin) are given voting power. They can cast their votes for their preferred projects. Outcome and Listing: The projects that garner the most votes in a specific round are then reviewed by Binance for technical and compliance checks. If they pass these checks, they are scheduled for listing. This process ensures that listed tokens have demonstrated community support and interest, potentially leading to more vibrant trading activity right from the start. The inclusion of Mubarak, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale showcases the diverse range of projects that can capture the attention of the crypto community. Meet the New Contenders: A Closer Look at MUBARAK, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale While detailed information about each of these newly listed tokens might be still emerging, let’s take a brief initial look based on their names and potential themes: Mubarak (MUBARAK): The name “Mubarak” translates to “blessed” or “fortunate” in Arabic. It’s possible this token is community-driven or meme-inspired, potentially with a focus on positivity or cultural themes. Further details on its utility and purpose will be crucial to understand its long-term potential. CZ’SDog (BROCCOLI714): This token’s name is clearly a playful nod to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the CEO of Binance, combined with “Dog,” suggesting a meme coin in the vein of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. The “BROCCOLI714” part could be an inside joke or reference within its community. Meme coins often thrive on community enthusiasm and social media trends. Tutorial (TUT): “Tutorial” suggests an educational or guide-focused project. This token might be associated with a platform that offers learning resources, tutorials, or educational content related to blockchain, cryptocurrencies, or other topics. Its value proposition could lie in its utility for accessing or incentivizing educational content. BananaForScale (BANANAS31): This name is quirky and meme-like, referencing the internet meme of using a banana for scale in images. It’s highly likely to be another meme coin, potentially with a humorous or lighthearted community focus. Its appeal will likely depend on its community and viral potential. Important Note: As with all newly listed cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins and community tokens, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research and exercise caution when trading. These tokens can be highly volatile, and understanding their fundamentals, community, and use cases is essential before investing. What Trading Pairs Can We Expect for These New Crypto Listings? The Binance announcement mentions that trading will open for “certain trading pairs.” While the specific pairs weren’t detailed in the initial announcement, we can anticipate that they will likely include pairings with major cryptocurrencies like: USDT (Tether): A stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDT pairs are common for most crypto listings, providing a stable base currency for trading. BTC (Bitcoin): Bitcoin pairs are also frequently offered, allowing traders to exchange the new tokens directly for Bitcoin. BUSD (Binance USD): As Binance’s own stablecoin, BUSD pairs are also highly probable. BNB (Binance Coin): BNB pairs are common within the Binance ecosystem, offering utility for the native Binance token. Keep an eye on the Binance trading platform shortly before 9 p.m. (UTC) today to see the exact trading pairs that will be available for MUBARAK, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale. This information will be critical for traders looking to participate in the initial trading activity. Why are Binance Listings a Big Deal for New Crypto Tokens? Getting listed on Binance is a significant milestone for any cryptocurrency project. Here’s why it matters: Increased Visibility and Exposure: Binance is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. A listing instantly exposes a token to millions of users globally. Enhanced Liquidity: Binance provides deep liquidity, making it easier for traders to buy and sell tokens without significant price slippage. This is crucial for healthy price discovery and market stability. Credibility Boost: Binance has a rigorous listing process (even with community votes). Being listed on Binance can enhance a project’s credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of investors. Potential Price Impact: Historically, Binance listings have often led to a “Binance Effect,” where the price of the listed token experiences a significant surge due to increased demand and accessibility. However, this is not guaranteed and depends on various market factors. Navigating the New Listings: Tips for Crypto Traders As these new crypto listings go live on Binance, here are some actionable insights for traders: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before trading any new cryptocurrency, especially meme coins or community tokens, conduct thorough research. Understand their purpose, community, tokenomics, and risks. Start Small: Given the potential volatility of newly listed tokens, especially in the initial trading hours, consider starting with small positions. Manage your risk effectively. Monitor Trading Pairs: Pay close attention to the available trading pairs and liquidity. Be aware of potential price fluctuations and spreads, especially in the early stages of trading. Stay Informed: Follow Binance’s official announcements and community discussions for any updates or further information about these tokens. Conclusion: A Bold Move by Binance and a New Chapter for These Tokens Binance’s decision to list Mubarak, CZ’SDog, Tutorial, and BananaForScale through its “vote to list” process is a fascinating development. It underscores the growing influence of community sentiment in the crypto space and Binance’s willingness to embrace diverse projects. While the nature of these tokens, particularly the meme coins, suggests a degree of speculative trading, the Binance listing provides them with a significant platform to reach a global audience. As trading commences at 9 p.m. (UTC) today, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how these new tokens perform and what impact they have on the broader market. This event serves as a reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency landscape, where community-driven initiatives and unexpected listings can create exciting new opportunities.

In response, crypto market traders and investors also speculate over looming price gains due to enhanced market exposure brought by a top CEX.

This means users can trade the coins against BTC, USDT, and other assets available on the platform at zero fees.

Its intraday low and high were $0.09159 and $0.158, respectively. While two of the coins mirror a bull run amid enhanced market support, two trade in the red zone. What’s More? CoinGape earlier reported that Binance completed its inaugural Vote To List program for these tokens. As a result, new trade offerings were unveiled today. However, it’s worth mentioning that a few traders have sparked a speculative buzz with their MUBARAK coin transfers amid new listings. Soon after the announcement, three addresses deposited 22.15 million tokens to the leading exchange, per ‘ai_9684xtpa’ on X. If sold, two addresses could see over 100 times the profit, adding a layer of intrigue to the crypto’s price movements and insider trading speculations.

As the digital asset space continues to expand, new opportunities emerge, bringing fresh excitement to investors. This time, all eyes are on a new meme coin presale that has already started making waves. While meme coins capture the spotlight, Terra Classic and Celestia have also made headlines with recent developments. Terra Classic’s network upgrades could impact its price action, while Celestia’s expansion into modular blockchain solutions has drawn investor interest. However, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is stealing the show. With a massive staking APY, lucrative referral incentives, and engaging community competitions, its meme coin presale is gaining momentum fast. This article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, Terra Classic, and Celestia. Stake, Earn & Win Big with Arctic Pablo Coin’s 66% APY Rewards One of the biggest reasons Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) is the best crypto to invest in right now is its staking feature. During its meme coin presale, investors can lock in an impressive 66% APY, earning substantial passive income. But that’s just the start. APC’s ecosystem is designed to reward active participation. Holders who refer new investors can earn extra tokens through its lucrative referral program. Additionally, community competitions offer exciting opportunities to win APC or even USD rewards. With multiple earning avenues, Arctic Pablo Coin is positioning itself as a high-reward project for early adopters. Given the meme coin presale’s growing traction, staking now could yield significant returns before its official launch. Arctic Pablo Coin Reaches Crystal Cove – The 16th Phase & Counting! The Arctic Pablo Coin meme coin presale is unlike any other. Instead of traditional stages, it follows a unique journey-based approach, progressing through different locations as Arctic Pablo “travels.” Now, the presale has reached Crystal Cove, marking its 16th phase and showcasing unstoppable growth. With previous locations selling out at record speed, APC has now surpassed $2 million in funds raised. The current price sits at $0.000083, offering an ROI of 9552.41% from this phase to the listing price of $0.008. As each location passes, the price rises, making this the last chance to enter at this discounted rate. Previous phases sold out sooner than expected, meaning Crystal Cove won’t last long either. With interest surging and price increases on the horizon, securing APC tokens now could be a game-changer before it moves to the next location. Terra Classic Sees Major Upgrade, Boosting Market Confidence Terra Classic (LUNC) has recently implemented a new network upgrade aimed at improving transaction efficiency and reducing gas fees. This upgrade comes as part of the project’s continuous efforts to rebuild trust after the historic collapse of the original Terra ecosystem. With enhanced scalability and security measures, Terra Classic developers hope to attract more users and projects back to the network. Market analysts speculate that these technical improvements could lead to increased adoption, potentially impacting LUNC’s price action in the coming weeks. Celestia Expands Modular Blockchain Adoption Celestia is making headlines as it continues expanding its modular blockchain ecosystem. The project recently announced new partnerships with emerging Web3 protocols, allowing developers to build more scalable applications using Celestia’s innovative infrastructure. By separating consensus from execution, Celestia’s architecture enables projects to customize their blockchains while maintaining security. With increased adoption and developer interest, Celestia’s role in the blockchain industry is growing, positioning it as a key player in the next wave of decentralized applications. Final Verdict: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge in the Meme Coin Presale Scene With Terra Classic enhancing its network and Celestia advancing modular blockchain technology, both projects remain intriguing prospects. However, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now . Its meme coin presale is moving fast, with Crystal Cove already underway, an attractive 66% APY staking reward, and an ever-growing community of investors. As prices climb with each new phase, now is the time to grab APC before the next location shift skyrockets its value.

To prevent losses for affected traders, the platform has confirmed that users who held long JELLY positions at settlement will be compensated $0.037555. However, flagged accounts will not be eligible for this refund. Hyperliquid: For users holding long JELLY positions at settlement, the Foundation will compensate them at a price of 0.037555. Hyperliquid will strengthen risk management: HLP will set limits on the Liquidator vault; if losses exceed the limit, ADL will be triggered; the open… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 28, 2025 What triggered the Hyperliquid liquidation incident involving the JELLY token? The issue started when a trader executed a self-trade of 4 million USDC in JELLY at a low price of $0.0095. This move caused JELLY’s price to surge more than four times, leading Hyperliquid’s backstop protection system (HLP) to step in and liquidate the position. However, this liquidation ended up causing losses to HLP’s account value. Although Hyperliquid had restrictions in place to prevent excessive open interest, the problem arose when HLP took control of the position. Instead of triggering automatic deleveraging (ADL) to manage the risk, the system continued operating as usual because it shared collateral across multiple vaults. This flaw exposed HLP to unexpected losses. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen criticized Hyperliquid’s handling of the March 26 incident, warning that its approach to risk management could turn it into “FTX 2.0.” She raised concerns over how the platform managed the liquidation event, suggesting it posed serious risks to the exchange’s stability. What changes is Hyperliquid making after the March 26 JELLY incident? Yesterday is a good reminder to stay humble, hungry, and focused on what matters: building a better financial system owned by the people. Hyperliquid is not perfect, but it will continue to iterate and grow through the collective efforts of builders, traders, and supporters.… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) March 27, 2025 Hyperliquid is making big changes to avoid another major issue like the one on March 26. The platform is tightening control over its Liquidator vault, which steps in when big trades go wrong. Now, it won’t be able to take on too much risk, and money from other vaults won’t automatically be used to cover losses. If losses go beyond a set limit, an emergency system (ADL) will kick in to stabilize things. Another important update is that trading limits (OI caps) will now adjust based on market size. This will prevent huge trades from causing sudden price spikes or crashes. On top of that, Hyperliquid will introduce a voting system where validators will decide whether to remove certain assets if they don’t have enough liquidity or market activity. These changes aim to make the platform safer and more stable for traders. What concern did Hung Dang raise about the Hyperliquid JELLY incident? One X user, Hung Dang, raises a critical point about the recent Hyperliquid incident, questioning what happens to users who withdrew from the Vault before the platform intervened. If they pulled out early, their losses would be their own, rather than being covered by the Vault operator. However, since they had no way of knowing whether Hyperliquid would step in, they were in a tough spot—potentially taking losses that others who stayed might have avoided. This highlights the uncertainty traders faced during the crisis. Overall, the JELLY incident was a wake-up call for Hyperliquid, revealing system loopholes that need stronger security measures. FAQ What Happened in the Hyperliquid JELLY Incident? A self-trade of 4 million USDC in JELLY at a low price caused a sudden price spike. Hyperliquid’s liquidation system responded, but it ended up losing funds instead of protecting them. Why Did Hyperliquid’s Risk System Fail? The failure happened due to shared collateral across multiple vaults and no trigger for automatic deleveraging (ADL). This design flaw led to unexpected platform losses. How Did the JELLY Token Price Spike So Drastically? A user executed a self-trade at $0.0095, pushing JELLY’s price up by over 400%.

Fartcoin hit the $1 billion mark in no time, and Dogwifhat’s Solana base and standout branding pushed it to rapid growth with a loyal holder base. But the question remains—how decentralized are they really? That’s where Dragoin ($DDGN) enters the conversation. Rather than riding a wave of memes alone, it plans to renounce its smart contract after launch—removing centralized authority altogether. It’s a move that might appeal to investors looking not just for hype, but for structure and security from day one. Fartcoin: Community-Driven Growth with Fast Results Launched on October 18, 2024, Fartcoin quickly turned heads with its AI-created concept rooted in humor. A unique reward system allowed users to earn tokens for sharing jokes, helping build a strong and fast-growing community. In just two months, Fartcoin’s market cap crossed the $1 billion mark. As of March 25, 2025, it trades at around $0.5245. While it has dropped 6.94% in the past 24 hours, it’s gained 88.18% over the past week. With close to 1 billion tokens in circulation, its market cap sits at approximately $524 million. Fartcoin’s performance shows what community energy can do—but its long-term structure raises some important questions about control and sustainability. Dogwifhat: Solana’s Meme Hit with Momentum Dogwifhat (WIF) launched in November 2023 on the Solana blockchain. With a Shiba Inu mascot wearing a knitted hat, it quickly became a recognizable and well-liked meme token. Its lighthearted branding and community-first feel sparked major interest. By February 2025, it had surged 60% in just one week. As of March 25, 2025, WIF is priced at $0.5488, up 0.49% in the last 24 hours and 16.35% for the week. With roughly 999 million tokens circulating, it holds a market cap of about $549 million. Dogwifhat’s growth has been impressive, but like many meme tokens, centralized controls still exist behind the scenes—something that may matter more to future investors. Dragoin’s Contract Renouncement Signals a Different Approach What sets Dragoin apart isn’t just the theme or community—it’s the mechanics. Dragoin has committed to renouncing its smart contract once it launches. This means the contract becomes immutable. No one—developers or insiders—can make changes, freeze the token, or interfere with liquidity. This isn’t a marketing statement. It’s a built-in protection. It eliminates the risk of rug pulls, stealth edits, or sudden shifts in control. For early-stage investors, that kind of commitment can’t be overstated. It turns Dragoin from just another meme coin into something potentially more reliable. In a time when many projects still reserve backend access, Dragoin’s approach shifts power entirely to its holders. The rules are baked into the code. No permissions. No exceptions. The design gives users the confidence that their holdings can’t be tampered with after launch. That’s not just good practice—it’s a strong message to the market. In the Long Run, Trust Might Be the Real Value Fartcoin and Dogwifhat show that community and viral momentum can bring fast results. Their rise reflects how effective meme branding can be in crypto—but both still depend on centralized oversight to some degree. Dragoin, by contrast, is choosing a more transparent path. Renouncing its contract post-launch shows that it’s not just playing into trends—it’s trying to build something solid. As investors become more cautious and seek tokens with real safeguards, Dragoin’s structure could give it an edge. The meme coin world will likely remain unpredictable. But Dragoin’s push for decentralized ownership might help it do more than just survive the cycle. It might just set a standard. In this space, trust isn’t earned through slogans—it’s written into the code.

Filed on Mar. 27, South Carolina’s Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act seeks to give the state treasurer the authority to hold Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets as a hedge against inflation. According to the bill , inflation has reduced the purchasing power of retirement funds and state-managed assets. To protect its finances, South Carolina wants to diversify them. Bitcoin is viewed as a possible hedge against economic volatility. The proposed Digital Assets Reserve would enable the state to own and manage Bitcoin while also allowing South Carolinians to voluntarily donate digital assets. The bill sets clear investment guidelines, requiring safe storage through cold wallets or certified custodians and capping holdings of digital assets at 10% of total funds under management. Additionally, the state is only permitted to hold a maximum of 1 million BTC.

The state treasurer would be required to publish public addresses of the reserve’s holdings to maintain transparency and enable citizens to confirm transactions. The proposal comes as South Carolina pushes to reverse its stance on crypto regulation. On a Mar. 27 post on X, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal revealed that the state has dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase’s staking services, paving the way for the exchange to relaunch staking for residents.

He pointed out that 52 million Americans own crypto and need clear rules and consumer protections. Grewal praised South Carolina for its decision and said he hopes other states with staking bans will follow.

Kennedy Grills Paul Atkins on SBF Pardon Rumors,https://coinpaper.com/8254/sen-kennedy-grills-paul-atkins-on-sbf-pardon-rumors,"Kennedy warned that SBF cannot receive any preferential treatment and also called for stricter action against SBF and his family. Meanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz introduced the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act” to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency, due to privacy concerns. In South Korea, a court temporarily lifted a business suspension that was imposed on major crypto exchange Upbit. This now allows it to resume onboarding new users despite ongoing legal battles and regulatory scrutiny over alleged KYC and anti-monopoly violations. No Special Treatment for SBF US Senator John Kennedy grilled prospective SEC chairman Paul Atkins during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on March 27. He specifically focused on the possibility of a presidential pardon for Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried. Kennedy is a Republican from Louisiana, and directed a series of pointed questions at Atkins. These questions specifically addressed reports that SBF’s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, were seeking a pardon for their son. The senator also raised concerns about donations made by the Bankman-Fried family to Stanford University and called on the SEC to take action to ensure there are no double standards in the application of justice. Sen. Kennedy questioning Atkins Kennedy was especially frustrated with what he described as SEC inaction, and also vowed to continue pressing the agency on the matter. He argued that SBF and his family should not be treated differently from other Americans, stating, “They are crooks, and I expect the SEC to do something about it.” Speculation about a possible pardon gained more traction after reports surfaced in January that SBF’s family was seeking clemency from the newly elected US President Donald Trump. These efforts happened in the wake of Trump’s decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road marketplace. However, experts cast doubt on the likelihood of SBF receiving a similar pardon. William Livolsi, executive director of the White Collar Support Group, pointed out that the cases differ quite a bit as Ulbricht’s crimes were non-violent and victimless, while SBF’s actions led to billions of dollars in losses for investors. (Source: Truth Social) Despite facing a lengthy prison sentence, SBF recently tried to realign himself politically by granting interviews to conservative media outlets. In February, he spoke with The New York Sun and followed up in March with an interview with Tucker Carlson . However, the latter interview was not approved by prison authorities, and resulted in SBF being placed in solitary confinement and transferred from a New York prison to a facility in Oklahoma. Cruz Introduces Another Bill to Ban CBDC Other US lawmakers are also trying to make a difference in the crypto space. US Senator Ted Cruz introduced new legislation on March 26 that is aimed at preventing the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The proposed bill is called the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act,” and will block the Fed from offering digital financial products or services directly to American citizens, effectively banning the creation of a retail CBDC. This move is very similar to a bill that was reintroduced earlier in March by Representative Tom Emmer, a Republican from Minnesota. In fact, both bills place a lot of emphasis on the need to preserve the privacy protections associated with traditional cash and coins. First page of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act The Federal Reserve has been researching the potential for a digital dollar since 2020, with at least four projects currently underway. However, Cruz consistently opposed the idea of a CBDC, and introduced related legislation multiple times since 2022. He openly voiced his concerns about the government using digital currency to exert greater control over citizens’ financial lives. Emmer shares similar concerns, and called CBDC technology “inherently un-American” and even warned it could threaten personal freedoms. Emmer speaking about CBDCs at a House Financial Services Committee Hearing Critics argue that CBDCs could lead to mass surveillance and increase the government’s ability to monitor financial activity. Despite this very strong opposition in the US, several countries around the world are continuing to explore or develop their own CBDCs. In Europe, lawmakers are advancing plans for a digital euro despite low consumer interest. Israel also shared preliminary designs for a digital shekel, and Iran is reportedly preparing to launch a CBDC. In the US, resistance to CBDCs is still very strong. President Donald Trump pledged to block the creation of a digital dollar, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that no CBDC will be issued under his leadership. While CBDC proponents argue that digital currencies could improve the efficiency of financial systems, critics fear the centralization of money supply and the erosion of individual privacy. Court Suspends FIU Ban on Upbit Services Meanwhile, the crypto landscape in South Korea is changing as well. A South Korean court temporarily lifted a partial business suspension that was imposed on the country’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit. This allows the platform to resume onboarding new clients while the legal dispute unfolds. The suspension was originally issued by South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) on Feb. 25, and it barred Upbit from accepting deposits and withdrawals from new customers for three months. The FIU claimed the penalty was due to Upbit’s alleged violations of rules prohibiting transactions with unregistered virtual asset service providers (VASPs). After the suspension, Dunamu, Upbit’s parent company, filed a lawsuit against the FIU looking to overturn the order and requested an injunction to suspend the enforcement of the restriction. On March 27, local media reported that the court granted the injunction, and delayed the suspension until 30 days after a final court ruling. Overall, this latest development allows Upbit to continue servicing new users in the interim. Upbit has operated since 2017, and is facing broader regulatory scrutiny beyond the recent suspension. In October of 2023, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) launched an investigation into the exchange over potential violations of anti-monopoly laws. Additionally, the FIU accused Upbit of breaching Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, identifying between 500,000 and 600,000 potential KYC violations during a review of the exchange’s business license renewal. The exchange is also suspected of facilitating approximately 45,000 transactions with unregistered foreign crypto platforms, which is in violation of South Korea’s financial transaction reporting laws. South Korea’s regulators have greatly increased their efforts to tighten control over the crypto industry, particularly when it comes to cross-border transactions. In late 2024, Finance Minister Choi Sang-Mok announced new reporting requirements for businesses handling international digital asset transactions, which is aimed at curbing tax evasion and currency manipulation. As part of this crackdown, Google Play blocked the apps of 17 crypto exchanges at the FIU’s request, with additional steps being taken to restrict access through internet platforms and Apple’s App Store.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|FIAT|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-28 06:06:00

PI’s community quickly picked up the positive price actions, which came after weeks of consecutive retracements, and outlined bullish predictions. Less than a week after its official launch on February 20, PI skyrocketed to a fresh all-time high at $3 on February 26. However, its momentum quickly evaporated, and the asset went south hard. In the following month, PI plunged by over 70% and dumped to under $0.75, which many analysts highlighted as an important support zone that could lead to a price reversal. This seems to be the case so far, as PI has risen by over 14% since that local bottom. On a daily scale alone, the asset is up by 4.1%, according to data from CoinGecko. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko Although 4% doesn’t sound like much, especially when considering its overall crash in the past month, it’s particularly impressive given the fact that almost the entire crypto market is in the red today. BTC is down below $86,000 once again, while alts such as DOGE, LINK, SHIB, DOT, APT, and ICP have dropped by over 5%. PI’s growing community praised the price reversal, and some projected an immediate surge to $1.2. Others highlighted the growing trading volume, which could be considered a good sign as well in an environment of low activity in the broader market. Perhaps what’s most bullish in regards to PI’s price movements is the fact that the token’s exchange deposits have slowed down to roughly a million, compared to the massive numbers registered over the past month. At one point, there were over 300 million PI tokens transferred to centralized exchanges, which increases the selling pressure immediately. $PI exchanges deposits are finally slowing down. In the last 24 hours only 1M $PI was deposited.

According to a recent report by Watcher.Guru on X, BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund has disclosed holdings amounting to a staggering $47.4 million in these newly accessible investment vehicles. This revelation not only highlights BlackRock’s confidence in Bitcoin but also marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for further institutional capital influx and broader mainstream acceptance. Let’s dive into what this explosive news means for the future of crypto investment and the role of Bitcoin ETFs . BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Investment: What Happened? The buzz started when Watcher.Guru, a prominent crypto news source, reported on X about BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund’s latest disclosure. This wasn’t just a minor allocation; $47.4 million directed towards spot Bitcoin ETFs is a significant sum, especially coming from a fund as renowned as BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund. For those new to the term, a spot Bitcoin ETF is an investment fund that directly holds Bitcoin. This is in contrast to futures-based ETFs which invest in Bitcoin futures contracts. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by regulatory bodies was a landmark event, making it easier for institutional investors and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes this announcement noteworthy: Magnitude of Investment: $47.4 million is a substantial initial investment, signaling serious intent from BlackRock. Fund Significance: The investment is through BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund, a fund known for its diversified portfolio and strategic asset allocation. Spot ETF Impact: Investing in spot Bitcoin ETFs reflects a belief in the long-term value and stability of Bitcoin as an asset. Institutional Validation: BlackRock, being the world’s largest asset manager, lends immense credibility to crypto investment as a whole. This move by BlackRock isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger trend of institutional investors gradually warming up to cryptocurrencies. However, BlackRock’s entry at this scale is particularly impactful due to their sheer size and influence in the financial world. Why is BlackRock’s Institutional Investment in Bitcoin ETFs a Big Deal? The question on everyone’s mind is: why is this $47.4 million investment causing such a stir? The answer lies in the credibility and influence that institutional investment giants like BlackRock bring to the table. Here’s why this development is profoundly significant: Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class: BlackRock’s investment acts as a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a viable asset class. When a firm of BlackRock’s stature allocates capital to Bitcoin ETFs, it sends a strong signal to other institutions and investors that Bitcoin is not just a fleeting trend but a maturing asset worthy of consideration in diversified portfolios. Increased Institutional Adoption: This move could trigger a domino effect, encouraging other large institutional investors who have been hesitant to enter the crypto space to now explore Bitcoin ETFs . Fear of missing out (FOMO) in the institutional world is a real phenomenon, and BlackRock’s action might just be the catalyst needed to unlock further institutional capital. Enhanced Market Liquidity and Stability: Significant institutional investment can inject substantial liquidity into the Bitcoin market. Increased liquidity can lead to reduced volatility and greater market stability, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors. Broader Mainstream Acceptance: BlackRock’s involvement can accelerate the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As traditional financial institutions embrace Bitcoin, it becomes more integrated into the conventional financial system, reducing the perception of it being a fringe or risky asset. Essentially, BlackRock’s investment is not just about the $47.4 million; it’s about the symbolic weight and the precedent it sets for the future of crypto investment . It’s a clear indication that institutional walls are breaking down, and Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a legitimate part of the global financial landscape. The Benefits of Spot Bitcoin ETFs for Investors Spot Bitcoin ETFs have emerged as a game-changer for both institutional and retail investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin. But what makes them so appealing? Here are some key benefits: Accessibility and Convenience: Spot Bitcoin ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to investors with brokerage accounts. You don’t need to navigate crypto exchanges, manage private keys, or worry about crypto wallets. It’s as simple as buying shares of a stock. Regulatory Compliance and Security: ETFs are regulated investment products, offering a layer of security and compliance that might be reassuring, especially for institutional investors and those wary of the unregulated nature of direct crypto ownership. Custody and security of the underlying Bitcoin are managed by the ETF provider. Diversification Tool: Bitcoin ETFs provide a straightforward way to diversify investment portfolios. Bitcoin has shown low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, making it a potentially valuable tool for risk management and enhancing portfolio returns. Tax Efficiency (Potentially): Depending on your jurisdiction and investment strategy, investing in Bitcoin through an ETF might offer certain tax advantages compared to direct Bitcoin ownership. It’s crucial to consult with a tax advisor for personalized advice. Lower Barrier to Entry: For investors intimidated by the technical complexities of buying, storing, and securing Bitcoin directly, spot Bitcoin ETFs significantly lower the barrier to entry. You can invest in Bitcoin without needing deep technical knowledge of blockchain or cryptocurrency. In essence, spot Bitcoin ETFs democratize access to Bitcoin investment, making it more approachable, secure, and convenient for a wider range of investors. BlackRock’s investment is a testament to the growing recognition of these benefits within the institutional investment community. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Crypto Investment While the news of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF investment is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective and acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with crypto investment . The cryptocurrency market, while promising, is still relatively nascent and comes with its own set of uncertainties: Challenge/Risk Description Volatility The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility. Bitcoin prices can experience significant swings in short periods, which can lead to substantial gains but also losses. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations can significantly impact the market and the value of crypto assets. Market Manipulation Compared to traditional markets, the crypto market can be more susceptible to manipulation due to its relatively smaller size and fragmented nature. Security Risks While ETFs mitigate some security risks related to direct Bitcoin ownership, the underlying Bitcoin held by the ETF is still subject to security threats, although managed by professional custodians. Technological Risks The technology underlying cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Potential technological disruptions or vulnerabilities could impact the value and stability of Bitcoin. Investors considering Bitcoin ETFs or any crypto investment must conduct thorough research, understand their risk tolerance, and ideally consult with a financial advisor. Diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risks in the volatile crypto market. While spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a more regulated and accessible route to Bitcoin exposure, they are not risk-free investments. How to Leverage Spot Bitcoin ETFs for Portfolio Diversification For investors intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin but seeking a more traditional and regulated investment avenue, spot Bitcoin ETFs can be a valuable tool for portfolio diversification. Here’s how you can consider leveraging them: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Before investing in Bitcoin ETFs , honestly evaluate your risk tolerance. Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets, and you should be comfortable with the possibility of price fluctuations. Determine Allocation Size: Decide what percentage of your portfolio you want to allocate to Bitcoin ETFs . Financial advisors often recommend starting with a small allocation, especially when venturing into new asset classes like crypto. Integrate with Existing Portfolio: Consider how Bitcoin ETFs fit within your existing investment portfolio. Given Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets, it can be used to potentially enhance portfolio diversification and reduce overall risk. Long-Term Perspective: Approach Bitcoin ETFs with a long-term investment horizon. Cryptocurrency markets can be unpredictable in the short term, but many investors believe in the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as needed. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , backed by institutional interest like BlackRock’s, offer a compelling way to incorporate Bitcoin into a diversified investment strategy. However, prudent investing always requires due diligence, risk management, and a clear understanding of your investment goals. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investment BlackRock’s $47.4 million investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a resounding declaration of confidence in Bitcoin and the future of digital assets. This move by the world’s largest asset manager signifies a maturing crypto market, attracting serious institutional investment and moving closer to mainstream financial integration. For investors, spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a more accessible, regulated, and convenient pathway to participate in the potential growth of Bitcoin, albeit with a clear understanding of the inherent risks involved. As institutional adoption continues to gain momentum, we are likely witnessing the dawn of a new chapter in the evolution of crypto investment , where digital assets become increasingly intertwined with the traditional financial world.

He said this forecast stands regardless of whether or not there is more clarity on US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and potential recession concerns.

Coutts based his rosy rebound prediction on easing financial conditions, a weakening US dollar and the People’s Bank of China ramping up liquidity since early 2025. “Financial conditions have eased dramatically this month, highlighted by the US dollar’s third-largest three-day decline since 2015 and significant drops in rates and Treasury bond volatility,” he said. “Liquidity remains central to investing in all asset classes,” he added. Bitcoin is down 3.16% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $85,880, down 3.16% over the past month, as per CoinMarketCap data. Coutts referred to his March 7 X post, where he said that based on the US Dollar Index (DXY) recent moves through a “historical lens,” it makes it hard to be “anything but bullish” about Bitcoin. Based on historical DXY performance, Coutts said that by June 1, Bitcoin's 90-day forecast ranges from a worst-case price of $102,000 to a best-case scenario of $123,000. Source: Jamie Coutts The upper target would represent a 13% gain over its current all-time high of $109,000 , which it reached on Jan. 20. BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick , recently said that Bitcoin will most likely thrive in a recessionary macro environment. “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin,” Mitchnick said in a March 19 interview with Yahoo Finance.

It comes at the same time that Bitcoin continues to experience its “least bullish conditions” since January 2023, according to CryptoQuant. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is at 20, its lowest since January 2023, signaling a weak Bitcoin market with low chances of a strong rally soon. Based on historical performance, if the score remains below 40 for an extended period, it could signal continued bearish market conditions, similar to previous bear market phases.

It was a calculated attempt to put an end to the industry,” Marszalek said in a March 27 X post.

Prospective SEC chair pressed on sale of FTX-tied firm Lawmakers in the US Senate Banking Committee questioned prospective Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member Paul Atkins on his ties to the crypto industry and how he might regulate digital assets if confirmed. Questioning Atkins at his nomination hearing on March 27, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the committee’s ranking member, said the former SEC commissioner had had “staggeringly bad judgment” in his role leading up to the 2008 financial crisis — Atkins served at the agency from 2002 to 2008. Sen. Warren also asked Atkins to disclose the buyers of his consulting firm Patomak Global Partners — which advised crypto exchange FTX before its collapse in 2022 — for transparency about potential conflicts of interest with the digital asset industry. “Your clients pay you north of $1,200 an hour for advice on how to influence regulators like the SEC, and if you’re confirmed, you will be in a prime spot to deliver for all those clients who’ve been paying you millions of dollars for years,” said Sen. Warren, suggesting Atkins’ judgment “will be influenced by more than an objective assessment of the data.” Paul Atkins addressing lawmakers at March 27 nomination hearing. Source: US Senate Banking Committee The Massachusetts senator sent a letter to Donald Trump’s SEC pick on March 23, calling on him to be prepared to answer questions related to his potential role at the agency based on his ties to the crypto industry through Patomak. At the March 27 hearing, Sen. Warren asked Atkins to disclose the consulting firm’s potential buyers — he said he planned to sell the company if confirmed — who might be “buying access to the future chair of the SEC.” Atkins said he would “abide by the process” but did not directly answer Sen. Warren’s question. She suggested that the sale of Patomak could be a “pre-bribe” for the former SEC commissioner’s services.

This move promises to reshape how investors interact with global markets, offering a level of flexibility previously unseen in traditional finance. By leveraging blockchain technology, D-ETF aims to dismantle geographical and temporal barriers, opening up new avenues for both retail and institutional investors. Breaking the Time Barrier with Blockchain The conventional stock market operates within rigid schedules, often leaving investors vulnerable to overnight market fluctuations. This limitation has historically disadvantaged those unable to react promptly to breaking news or global events. D-ETF’s solution lies in its integration of blockchain technology, allowing for decentralized and continuous trading. This infrastructure facilitates constant market access, empowering investors to execute trades at their convenience, regardless of time zones or traditional market hours. The benefits of this approach are manifold. Firstly, investors gain the ability to react instantly to market-moving events. For example, if a significant economic announcement occurs outside of standard trading hours, investors can capitalize on the information immediately, rather than waiting for the next trading day. This capability is particularly crucial in today’s fast-paced, interconnected global economy, where news travels rapidly and market reactions can be swift. Secondly, the platform fosters borderless trading, enabling global participation without regional market hour restrictions. This democratization of access is facilitated by the inherent nature of blockchain technology, which transcends geographical boundaries. Furthermore, the 24/7 trading environment enhances market liquidity, as continuous trading opportunities contribute to improved price efficiency. The decentralized infrastructure also provides enhanced security and transparency, ensuring that transactions are tamper-proof and easily verifiable. Empowering Investors with Enhanced Control and Accessibility D-ETF’s mission extends beyond simply offering continuous trading. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance. By providing an all-in-one platform, D-ETF eliminates the need for users to navigate multiple brokerage accounts and cryptocurrency exchanges, streamlining the investment process. This consolidation is designed to simplify investing for both novice and experienced traders, making it more accessible and manageable. The platform’s commitment to innovation is evident in its continuous expansion of offerings, including real-world asset tokenization. This initiative reflects a broader trend in the financial sector, where traditional assets are being represented on blockchain networks to enhance liquidity and accessibility. By tokenizing real-world assets, D-ETF is opening up new investment opportunities and democratizing access to previously exclusive markets. Joel Felice Kuck, CEO of D-ETF, highlights the platform’s transformative potential, emphasizing its role in “reshaping how investors interact with traditional financial markets.” This vision of empowering global investors with greater flexibility and control is central to D-ETF’s operations. The platform’s focus on security, efficiency, and innovation positions it as a key player in the evolving financial landscape.",Information,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 06:51:54

Top Analyst Hints at Massive Rally!,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-gearing-up-for-a-surge-top-analyst-hints-at-massive-rally/,"The post Altcoin Season Gearing Up for a Surge? Top Analyst Hints at Massive Rally! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is still recovering from its March crash, but a major Altcoin rally could be on the horizon. Crypto analyst Crypto Rover has spotted a key pattern hinting at a massive breakout. While the fear & greed index is in fear zone, many believe an explosive altcoin season could be next. Altcoins Poised for Massive Surge? According to Crypto Rover’s analysis , altcoins are currently moving between Fibonacci levels 1 and 1.272, just like they did before the big rally in 2021. Back then, once altcoins broke above the 1.618 Fibonacci level, the total market cap soared from $240 billion to $1.8 trillion. The Fibonacci retracement tool is often used by traders to find important price levels. When prices move between these levels for some time and then break out, it can lead to a strong rally. Now, in 2025, a similar pattern is forming. Crypto Rover’s chart highlights a key resistance level that altcoins are struggling to break. If they manage to push past it, it could trigger another massive rally. If history repeats itself, altcoins could see a huge surge, and the total market cap might even explode to nearly $9 trillion. Altcoin Season Index Stands At 18 The Altcoin Season Index tracks the price movements of the top 50 altcoins to determine if an altcoin season has begun. Usually, when the index reaches 75% or higher, it signals the start of an altcoin season. Right now, Blockchain Center reports the Altcoin season index is at 18 , meaning altcoins are not in control. At the same time, Bitcoin’s market dominance has risen to 62% , showing that investors prefer Bitcoin over altcoins. This suggests the market is in a Bitcoin season, where altcoins find it hard to match Bitcoin’s performance.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-28 06:56:05

Notably, the dip comes as market watchers eagerly await the upcoming US PCE inflation data, which might provide clarity on the Fed’s future stance with their rate cut plans. However, with the ongoing gloomy sentiment in the market, veteran trader Peter Brandt hints at a possible BTC crash to $70K ahead. Bitcoin Price Slips: What Lies Ahead? BTC price today was down more than 1.4% during writing and slipped below the $86,000 mark. Its trading volume from yesterday also recorded a slump of 2.4% to $25.8 billion. Notably, Bitcoin price has touched a 24-hour high and low of $85,837.93 and $87,702.17. However, a BTC price prediction showed that the crypto might end this month with a recovery to the $88K level. Despite that, Bitcoin Futures Open Interest was down over 1.5%, indicating a waning risk-bet appetite of the traders. Peter Brandt Hints At Bitcoin Price Crash Amid the ongoing gloomy momentum recorded in the broader crypto market, veteran trader and market expert Peter Brandt hints towards a potential BTC price crash ahead. For context, in a recent analysis on X, expert HTL-NL showed a chart that indicates BTC’s potential crash to $76,700 or even to around $70,000. Source: HTL-NL Sharing the analysis, Brandt said , “This is not an unreasonable expectation.” It indicates that the expert also believes that BTC might face strong selling pressure, which could send it to around the $70K level. Will The Bulls Dominate After US PCE Inflation Release? The current dip appears to be due to the investors staying on the sideline ahead of the crucial US PCE inflation release, scheduled for later today. Having said that, if the US PCE inflation comes in tandem with the market expectations, it could significantly boost the market sentiment. Notably, the declining inflationary pressure could help the US Fed to move with a dovish policy rate plan. Usually, the lower rates help boost the traders’ confidence, which in turn could drive the Bitcoin price higher. Meanwhile, analyst Javon Marks also shared a bullish forecast recently. In a recent X post, Marks highlighted BTC’s previous surge from $19K to $67,543. Comparing that with the current level, the expert predicted that BTC could hit between $116,600 and $118,800 if the history repeats. Besides, a flurry of other experts also anticipates a potential BTC breakout to a new ATH ahead. For context, Michael van de Poppe in a recent X post said that Bitcoin’s “Drops getting absorbed quickly and buying pressure is building up.” Source: Michael van de Poppe, X Considering that, he hinted towards a strong run for the flagship crypto in Q2.

A fifth wave is projected to push XRP’s price between $18.22 and $23.20. Dark Defender made it clear that this analysis is not financial advice.

The chart also aligns with Fibonacci extension levels, which are commonly used in technical analysis to predict price targets based on past movements. A 161.8% Fibonacci extension aligns with a price level of approximately $1.88, while the 261.8% extension coincides with the $5.85 target, and the 361.8% extension points toward the $18.22-$23.20 range. Higher Time Frames Indicating Long-Term Strength Dark Defender’s analysis reinforces the significance of higher time frames in determining market trends. While lower time frames may exhibit volatility, the broader trend can provide a clearer picture of potential price movements. The tweet suggests that the coming months could be pivotal for XRP’s long-term trajectory , especially if it follows the projected Elliott Wave pattern.

The closing of the current three-month candle on March 31 will be a key moment for traders monitoring XRP’s price action .

In the civil lawsuit filed against the former kickboxer, the model alleges that Tate physically assaulted her at the Beverly Hills Hotel on March 11. Stern’s allegations have sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency industry. Interestingly, in the last seven days, the SISTER meme coin has experienced a growth of 5.4%. Here is everything you should know. Key Allegations: What Stern Claims Happened at the Beverly Hills Hotel Through her social media handles, Stern states that she met Tate as part of a modelling project. She claims that Tate casted her as a model for his meme coin, DADDY. She also notes that he promised her to support her meme coin, SISTER. While explaining the horrific experience she had to go through in the Beverly Hills Hotel, she reveals that what started as a consensual physical relation turned violent when Tate began physically, verbally and mentally assaulting her. This is not the first time that Tate has faced a serious allegation of this nature. He, along with his brother Tristan, is facing serious criminal cases in Romania. Stern was admitted to a New York hospital after the horrific incident. As per an image published by an acclaimed media outlet, she was diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome, which is a set of symptoms that may continue for weeks, months or years after a concussion. This suggests that Stern may have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury during the incident. The lawsuit, which has the accurate details of the severity and nature of the injuries she suffered during the incident, has not yet been published by authorities. Tate’s Response: Legal Team Calls It a ‘Blatant Cash Grab’ Tate has not yet publicly responded to Stern’s allegations. A legal team, appointed by Tate, has dismissed the allegations as a ‘desperate attempt’ to exploit their client. Crypto Market Reaction: SISTER Meme Coin Surges In the 14 days, the SISTER meme coin market has experienced a surge of over 12%. In the last seven days alone, the market has grown by around 5.4%. The price of the SISTER meme coin is $0.00001037. The total market cap of this token stands at $103,365.

In a new strategy session, Svenson tells his 82,800 YouTube subscribers that technical analysis indicators are signaling that Bitcoin could break out from the long-term downtrend that started in December of 2024. Svenson says that on both the four-hour and the daily time frame, a downtrend line is converging with an uptrend line, a phenomenon that is also being replicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The RSI is a momentum oscillator that’s used to determine oversold and overbought conditions. “…so we’re getting a break above horizontal resistance on the daily RSI and the long-term downward sloping resistance. So there is a breakout now confirmed on the daily RSI. And this may be a leading indicator, a leading signal that Bitcoin may also create a breakout in the near term.” According to Svenson, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a momentum-based technical indicator that is used to determine trends and pinpoint potential buy and sell points, is also flashing a bullish signal for Bitcoin. “On the daily MACD, the bulls have the momentum as we’re resting right upon resistance. This could give us a reason to believe that we may see a breakout…” The crypto analyst also says that Bitcoin has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern on the three-day time frame and could go up by around 13% from the current level. “To get your target for the measured move, you go from the high to the low of the [ascending triangle] pattern and then extrapolate that onto the potential breakout zone… which is actually giving us a pretty stunning number. I mean $98,000… I guess it’s not too crazy to believe because we had this huge dump. We would basically just be regaining that lost ground from that big week down that we saw. So right now we may just create a U-shaped recovery that seems to be what we’re setting up for now.” Bitcoin is trading at $86,551 at time of writing.

A popular analyst on X outlined what needs to happen for the asset to kickstart its bull run, but XRP is not very close to it now. $2 or $3 Next? The price movements from XRP in the past several weeks have been quite underwhelming aside from a few brief spikes after Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement in mid March as well as when Trump mentioned it to be potentially included in the States’ strategic crypto reserve. As of now, XRP struggles at $2.25 after a 4% daily decline. This is far off the $3.4 local peak reached in mid January, ahead of Trump’s inauguration, when the cryptocurrency came just 1% away from breaking its 2018 all-time high. Despite the hype , the regulatory changes, the SEC lawsuit conclusion , and everything in between, XRP has not only failed to remain above $3 but it has lost its position as the third-largest digital asset to Tether’s USDT. With its price now sitting 33% lower than this cycle’s high, Ali Martinez outlined what needs to happen for XRP to restart its bull run. To invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, Ripple’s cross-border token needs to surge past $3, which seems like a distant target now. If $XRP can break above $3, it would invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially flipping the outlook bullish. pic.twitter.com/B6mrtXm1TS — Ali (@ali_charts) March 28, 2025 In contrast, Martinez highlighted $2 as a critical support level that needs to hold; otherwise XRP risks dumping toward $1.25. What’s Holding XRP Back? As CryptoPotato recently reported , everything seems to be going Ripple’s way. It’s not just the SEC lawsuit ending, or the hype around a potential US-based spot XRP ETF, or the friendlier administration. There’s more as the company considers an IPO while it also racks up new partnerships. However, XRP has failed to feel the positive impact in terms of price actions. It is closer now to the $2 support than the $3 resistance. Trading volumes have declined as even whales seem to be sitting on the sidelines , unlike what happened after the US elections. This could all be attributed to the overall market stagnation and the global economic uncertainty prompted by Trump’s controversial actions ever since he took office. Or, there could be more to the story that is yet to be unveiled to the public.

The overall demand for stablecoins has gradually increased in the past few weeks, as short-term holders find themselves under increasing financial pressure. The wider altcoin market has followed Bitcoin (BTC) price in correction mode after the flagship coin was rejected above $88k in the past few days. Chainlink, a large-cap altcoin with a fully diluted valuation of about $14.7 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $451 million, dropped nearly 6 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $14.75 on Friday, March 28, during the early trading session for the Western financial markets. Chainlink Price Expectations in Coming Weeks Since the beginning of 2025, Chainlink price has been trapped in a falling logarithmic trend, coupled with lower highs and lower lows in the daily timeframe. As a result, the LINK price is likely to retest the lower border of a rising channel, around $13, in the coming weeks. However, if the LINK price consistently closes above the resistance level of around $16, the bearish sentiment will be invalidated. Chainlink buyers must, however, flip the 100 and 200 Simple Moving Averages (SMA) into bullish sentiment to invalidate further downside risk. Closer Look at LINK Fundamentals Chainlink has seen a jump in social dominance across crypto social media following its hosting of a private meetup with key US government leaders.

According to data from crypto.news, Tutorial ( TUT ) rose from $0.0167 to an intraday high of $0.0564 before pulling back to $0.0396 by Friday afternoon in Asia. The rally extended its weekly gains to an impressive 2,600%, making it one of the top-performing altcoins over the period. The surge was backed by high trading activity, with on-chain data showing a 600% increase in daily volume, which crossed $189 million. TUT’s market cap stood at $38.5 million. Interest from derivatives traders also spiked, with CoinGlass reporting a 400% jump in open interest for TUT futures, reaching $73.59 million at the time of writing. Today’s gains were mostly fueled by community hype after TUT secured a listing on Binance. It was picked in the first round of the exchange’s “Vote to List” campaign , alongside other memecoins like Mubarak (MUBARAK), CZ’s Dog (BROCCOLI714), and Banana For Scale (BANANAS31). According to the platform’s official announcement, the memecoins, exempt from a listing fee, can now be traded against USDT and USDC pairs, with withdrawals opening on March 28 at 21:00 UTC. A seed tag has been applied to them. You might also like: Coinbase cleared in South Carolina as state drops staking lawsuit Traders are currently divided on what’s next. Some think a sell-off might be coming, which isn’t unusual after a major exchange listing, especially since the hype is often baked into the price before the listing even goes live. As reported by crypto.news, after getting listed on KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bitget on March 20, TUT rallied over 330% to hit a record high of $0.057. But the rally was short-lived as within 24 hours, the token lost nearly half its value as early buyers took profits. Still, not everyone is bearish. Technical analysts like gemxbt_agent are pointing to a bullish structure on the charts. According to their March 27 X post , TUT recently broke out of a consolidation pattern and formed a possible double-bottom reversal. Key support was noted around $0.03, with potential upside targets between $0.06 and $0.065. TUT price analysis On the 4-hour chart (TUT/USDT), the price recently formed a God candle followed by a few red candles, which usually hints at some selling pressure kicking in after the pump. TUT price, Supertrend and MACD chart — March 28 | Source: crypto.news Still, the Supertrend indicator just flipped green and is sitting above the price, which usually means the bullish momentum is still in play. That could open the door for another leg up. The MACD is also looking strong, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. On top of that, the Chaikin Money Flow is showing a positive reading, suggesting that fresh capital is still flowing into TUT. TUT CMF and RSI chart — March 28 | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, the RSI has cooled off a bit, dropping back to around 60 after hitting overbought levels. This means selling pressure might be fading, giving bulls more room to take control again. If momentum continues, TUT could make another push toward the $0.06 resistance level, the same spot it struggled to break on March 20. That said, there could be another round of selling before it gets there. Per CoinGlass, TUT’s weighted funding rate was negative at press time, meaning the majority of derivative traders were betting on a price correction.

The move follows the company’s court-approved bankruptcy wind-down plan and a $4.47 billion settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Terraform’s portal, claims.terra.money, will be live from 31 March 2025 through 30 April 2025 at 11:59 pm ET, giving affected users a one-month window to submit claims. Terra 🌍 Powered by LUNA 🌕 @terra_money · Follow Terraform Labs Creditors: The Crypto Loss Claims Portal is scheduled to open for submission of Crypto Loss Claims on March 31, 2025. Creditors may file Eligible Crypto Loss Claims at claims.terra.money . The deadline to file is April 30, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. (prevailing Eastern 10:11 am · 28 Mar 2025 109 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The recovery process is part of broader efforts to compensate investors after the 2022 collapse of TerraUSD and Luna triggered an estimated $40 billion in losses across global markets. TerraUSD claims process The Crypto Loss Claims Portal will allow creditors to submit claims by registering and verifying their ownership of impacted assets. Users with holdings in the Terra ecosystem, including supported networks, must complete a free on-chain transaction as verification. For other networks, Terraform recommends providing a read-only API key, though manual alternatives such as transaction logs or account statements will be accepted with longer review times. Claims will be evaluated by the Plan Administrator based on the user’s verified holdings. Assets under $100 in on-chain liquidity, and certain excluded tokens like Luna 2.0 on Terra 2.0, are ineligible for reimbursement. Review and payouts Once a claim is submitted, it will be reviewed by the Wind Down Trust, the entity overseeing Terraform’s bankruptcy process. Creditors can expect an update or final claim amount within 90 days of the 30 April deadline. Those who receive a final decision can either accept or dispute the amount via the same online portal. Claims that are accepted without dispute will qualify for pro rata payments. Distribution will begin as soon as funds become available, although exact payment dates have not been disclosed. Terraform has clarified that any payments to the SEC under its legal settlement will only occur after approved creditor claims are addressed. Bankruptcy and SEC settlement In September 2024, Terraform Labs was granted court approval to begin its formal liquidation process. This followed a significant fraud verdict in April that led to a $4.47 billion settlement with the SEC. The agreement came after Terraform and co-founder Do Kwon were found responsible for misleading investors and triggering the Terra ecosystem’s implosion. The settlement amount will be partially covered by Kwon’s assets, which include PYTH tokens and other holdings, though regulatory fines will only be paid after creditor obligations are fulfilled. The bankruptcy plan’s primary goal is to recover and redistribute funds to victims, prioritising those who suffered financial losses in the 2022 crash.

If the buyers regain ground in the current support level, a major bullish trend will kickstart in the coming three quarters towards the 2021’s ATH.

Sam Bankman-Fried’s federal prison journey took a sharp turn this week when the former FTX CEO, currently serving a 25-year sentence for investor fraud, was abruptly transferred from Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) to a federal transit center in Oklahoma City. This move follows closely on the heels of an unauthorized video interview Bankman-Fried conducted with Tucker Carlson, reportedly disguised as a legal call . That breach of protocol triggered disciplinary action and raised further questions about prison oversight. The transfer marks the beginning of SBF’s processing into the long-term federal prison system. Secret Tucker Carlson Interview Leads to Disciplinary Action Bankman-Fried’s controversial interview with Carlson, which aired earlier this month, apparently bypassed prison rules requiring advance approval for media contact.

MELANIA started trading near $0.001—fast forward, and early believers are stacking six-figure gains. But here’s the kicker: if you missed that golden entry point, another door just opened.

When the coin hits $0.006, that same bag could be worth $600,000. No fluff, just math. What makes BTFD different? Staking. With 90% APY, you’re not just HODLing—you’re compounding. Stake your tokens during the presale and earn massive returns, totally immune to outside market swings. Think of it as passive income on steroids.

MELANIA (Official Melania Meme): From Meme to Millions When MELANIA launched in early 2024, nobody took it seriously. Inspired by America’s former First Lady, the coin leaned into political humor and went viral overnight. Launched near $0.001, MELANIA quickly shot up on social media, fueled by memes and some cheeky nods to political drama. Critics dismissed it as a joke—investors didn’t. Now sitting well above its early-day price, those who jumped in with just a few hundred bucks are now watching their wallets bulge. MELANIA rode the wave of sentiment and community like a pro, proving once again that meme coins are more than memes—they’re financial vehicles for those who dare to believe early. But here’s the hard truth: that ship has already sailed. Sure, MELANIA still has legs, but its explosive early growth has cooled. That once-in-a-lifetime entry point? Gone. Enter BTFD—offering the same low entry, but with even more firepower: staking, P2E, and community-backed growth, all wrapped into a coin that hasn’t even launched yet. Conclusion: Don’t Just Watch Others Win—This Is Your Shot Fun fact: most meme coin millionaires didn’t buy at the peak. They got in before the hype, in presales just like this one. If you missed MELANIA’s meteoric rise, don’t sit on your hands again. BTFD Coin’s presale is the real deal, and it’s serving up more than just hype—it’s dishing out 100% bonus , 90% APY, and a 2900% ROI shot. We’re in a consolidation phase right now. While the big coins are yo-yoing and whales are sitting tight, presales like BTFD give regular folks a golden runway to grow their stacks without fear of market shocks. It’s hands-down one of the top new meme coins to invest in for short term gains—and time is ticking. Join before the BTFD Coin presale ends. Your next chance to get rich from a meme may already be here.

This groundbreaking move combines traditional finance with blockchain technology, enhancing transparency, security and liquidity. ETFs Set To Launch In April Powered by HashKey Chain, this project is set to revolutionize the future of asset management and digital finance. Notably, the Bosera HKD Money Market ETF and Bosera USD Money Market ETF, approved by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), will officially launch in April. The Bosera HKD and USD Money Market ETFs are part of Hong Kong’s Project Ensemble Sandbox, which explores the tokenization of real-world assets. As a member of this initiative, HashKey Group will continue working with the HKMA and SFC to advance Hong Kong’s tokenized ecosystem. These money market ETFs, known for low risk and high liquidity, combine traditional stability with the flexibility of blockchain technology, offering an innovative investment product for efficient cash management. Low-Risk Blockchain-Based Investment Options Bosera’s tokenized money market fund uses blockchain to offer greater transparency and efficiency, giving investors direct access to high-quality money market assets. Ideal for DeFi and virtual asset investors, it acts as a “yield stabilizer.” HashKey Group provides full tokenization support, with the product deployed on HashKey Chain for secure asset management. It will be distributed through HashKey Exchange, Hong Kong’s largest licensed platform, with additional custody services via the Earn Channel. “Bringing money market ETFs on-chain through blockchain technology is a crucial step for traditional finance to embrace Web3,” remarked Dr. Xiao Feng, Chairman and CEO of HashKey Group.

Crypto majors tracked by the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) showed a 4.5% slide on average, led by DOGE at 7%. Toncoin’s TON was the only token in the top-20 by market capitalization in the green with a 5% rise in the past 24 hours. Gold surged to fresh highs Friday with a jump above $3,109 in Asian morning hours, continuing a stellar rise since early March. The MSCI World Index had its longest losing streak in a month, per Bloomberg, while a regional gauge of Asian equities was poised for its biggest drop since Feb. 28. Over $12.2 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) options will expire with max pain at $85,000 later Friday. “Spot is trading sideways and OI continues to bleed lower, signalling a broad lack of near-term optimism in the market,” traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast. “With the PCE Index data due tomorrow, we believe any short-term upside remains capped as markets wait for clarity from Trump's next move in this escalating trade war.” The PCE index captures inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflects changes in consumer behavior. Released monthly, the PCE is said to influence Fed interest rate decisions. High PCE readings signal rising inflation, potentially prompting rate hikes to cool the economy, which can reduce risk appetite and pressure bitcoin prices downward as investors favor safer assets. Conversely, low PCE data suggests tame inflation, possibly leading to rate cuts or steady policy, boosting liquidity and supporting Bitcoin’s price as a speculative asset or inflation hedge. The next release is on March 28 and could sway market sentiment, with bitcoin’s reaction tied to how the data shapes Fed expectations — volatility often follows as traders adjust positions. Markets have been heavy since Thursday as President Donald Trump warned of deeper tariffs on Canada and the European Union in case the two collude and policies impact U.S. economic activity. In turn, Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada said late Thursday the country would move rapidly to trade more with other countries as the U.S. was “no longer a reliable partner.” “The global market is highly sensitive to monetary policies set by major economies, particularly the United States,” Innokenty Isers, Chief Executive Officer at Paybis, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “﻿With its relatively higher volatility, risk-averse investors may favor alternative inflation hedges instead of Bitcoin.” “Considering the longer stretch of the trade war and the potential inflation that will emerge, capital allocation to BTC as a hedge against economic instability might be reduced,” Isers warned.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-28 07:20:53

More than 7400 holders have captured tokens during the ongoing third phase, which makes the project a serious contender for both established rivals, such as Cardano, as well as recent meme-based movers like Pepe Coin (PEPE). Currently at $0.025 in Phase 4 — a phase that is filling out quickly — the token will see a 20% jump to $0.03 at the trade of Phase 5. For early supporters this equates a 140% launch gain, with MUTM’s initial trade price fixed at $0.06. Post-launch rallies are seen pushing the price to $3.50 due to the coin’s lending infrastructure and undiluted buy pressure, analysts forecast. Rapid Demand as Presale Momentum Builds With each presale phase locking in higher entry points, Mutuum Finance investors are scrambling get in on the ground floor of this ascending presale opportunity. Having increased 66% from its debut, the current price of $0.025 is still below its listing target of $0.06. Those who buy today will lock in a 2.4x return at launch and post-listing predictions could see a jaw-dropping 2,400% profit if prices reach $3.50. This trajectory is as much as 10x faster than speculative tokens like PEPE that derive value solely from meme virality with no underlying utility. In contrast, Cardano’s slow development cycle is a far cry from MUTM’s nimble presale campaign, which has already harnessed a community that rivals PEPE in size and activity. Innovative Mechanics Create Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance differs in approach with a dual-feature lending model which combines decentralized loans and yield farming. Users can deposit assets like ETH or DAI into the vault, where they receive interest-bearing mtTokens (mtETH, mtDAI) that appreciate over time. A section of those wBTC tokens can then be traded or staked across multiple DeFi platforms, adding liquidity without liquidating assets. Loans are accessed by locking and overcollateralizing reserves, this design reduces the risk of default and naturally stabilizes the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer feature facilitates direct negotiations for specialized assets (e.g., DOGE or SHIB) that would otherwise be impossible or impractical in traditional lending pools. Cash flows from Platform fees activate buy-and-distribute strategy with stable demand channel directed at acquiring MUTM. Then, these tokens are distributed to stakers, which incentivize holding long term, while putting a brake on selling. Such mechanics stand in stark contrast with PEPE’s volatility or Cardano’s increased sluggishness with protocol upgrades — balancing aggressive growth with structural safeguards for investors. Mutuum Finance merges speculative attraction with practical utility, in contrast to PEPE Coin’s meme-based approach and Cardano’s academic focus. The giveaways ($100,000 for early testers) and presale success highlight a community that believes in its roadmap. The team is in the final stages of a Certik audit of its smart contracts, results of which will come shortly through official channels. Such transparency builds trust, which calms fears often found in newer projects. Final Call for Early Entry Mutuum Finance’s Phase 4 window is starting to close, presenting one of the final chances to acquire tokens below $0.03. As Phase 5’s 20% price increase nears and exchange listings are on the horizon, the project’s unique blend of DeFi and strategic tokenomics ensures it is set for massive gains following these events. As the crypto market pivots towards utility-driven assets, MUTM’s combination of lending utility, buy pressure, and community momentum may set new expectations for altcoins in 2025. Be sure to lock in your place before this next round starts—any investors sitting on the fence now will lose out on the lowest entry point still left for this presale cycle. Stay tuned to Mutuum Finance social channels for audit updates and the final phase announcements.

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told CoinDesk in an interview that the ""impending gateway regime"" that is earmarked for 2026 will in fact be a new authorization regime for crypto companies. ""We will have a gateway which will allow authorization. But obviously we've got to go through those consultations, create those rules and get the legislation for that to take place,"" Long said. This regime will be a leap from the current anti-money laundering (AML) one. Firms like crypto exchanges Coinbase , Gemini and Bitpanda will move away from just needing to register with the country to comply with anti-money laundering rules to an authorization regime with rules for a suite of offerings. This will require them to go through a fresh process to secure approval from the FCA. The FCA intends to release papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and more this year. The regime is expected to go live after final policy papers are published in 2026, Long said. Since its anti-money laundering register for firms opened in 2020, the FCA received 368 applications from firms wishing to comply, but only 50 firms — 14% of applicants — have been approved so far. Many firms may have to start again.

Companies that engage in those activities will need to seek authorization. In 2023 the former U.K. government released papers that said regulated activities would likely include crypto and fiat-referenced stablecoins issuance as well as payment, exchange and lending activities . Stablecoins will no longer be brought under the U.K. payments regulations as set out in previous work, former Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq said in November . The FCA plans to consult on draft rules for stablecoins early this year. ""What we're doing in terms of the stablecoins is we're making sure that we take the best from the current regulation that exists in TradFi, but stablecoins are ultimately unique,"" Long said. ""There isn't anything that is exactly the same. We've got to adapt the regulation that we've currently got."" Read more: UK to Draft a Regulatory Framework for Crypto, Stablecoins Early Next Year Transition The FCA is still deciding on the process crypto companies will need to go through to get authorized, Long said. Long added that it was undecided what steps those who are already registered in the money laundering regime will need to take but the new regime will come with wider permissions,"" so we'd expect that if you wanted the further permissions, you'd apply for them."" Therefore companies may need to go through a lengthy registration process — even if they've already secured an existing license. ""We'll be communicating with firms about what the gateway will look like before it goes live, our intention is to bring it live as soon as humanly possible,"" Long said referring to the authorization regime. In formulating how it intends to move forward, the regulator plans to also look at Europe which has launched bespoke legislation for the crypto sector and the International Organization of Securities Commissions' 18 recommendations . IOSCO will soon be publishing a piece on how countries are progressing with its standards, someone familiar with the matter said. ""It's a case of understanding and looking for best practice,"" Long said.

33767162,[object Object],1743147010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposed by Brazil’s Vice Presidential Advisor,https://bitcoinist.com/strategic-bitcoin-reserve-brazil-vp-advisor/,"Brazil’s Vice President Geraldo Alckmin’s (PSB) chief of staff, Pedro Giocondo Guerra, underscored on Wednesday the importance of establishing a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. Guerra was speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of the new president of the FPBC (Parliamentary Front for Competitive Brazil), Deputy Júlio Lopes (PP-RJ), while representing the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT). “Rigorously debating the constitution of a sovereign reserve of bitcoin value is in the public interest and will be decisive for our prosperity. After all, Bitcoin is digital gold, the gold of the internet. It’s a technology that allows us to transmit wealth from one end of the planet to the other quickly and store the fruits of our labor efficiently and securely,” Guerra stated. Will Brazil Get A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? His remarks highlighted Bitcoin’s intrinsic appeal—particularly its digital scarcity and deflationary design, in contrast to fiat currencies that can be printed at will. Guerra noted that an official BTC reserve might bolster the country’s resilience and adaptability, especially amid global economic and geopolitical fluctuations. Notably, Congressman Eros Biondini (PL-MG) has introduced PL 4501/2024 , which would permit the creation of a Sovereign Strategic Reserve of Bitcoins—referred to in the bill as RESBit. According to Biondini, the primary goal is to guard Brazil against currency fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainties by diversifying the government’s international reserves. The text proposes a limit of 5% of the country’s international reserves—which totaled $366 billion in December—for Bitcoin acquisitions. Should it pass, Brazil would be authorized to invest as much as $18.3 billion in Bitcoin, based on the reserve’s valuation at the time the bill was drafted. Currently under review by Rapporteur Luiz Gastão (PSD-CE) in the Lower House’s Economic Development Committee, the bill sets forth guidelines for gradual acquisition and emphasizes robust security measures, using cold wallets and advanced AI- and blockchain-based monitoring. The legislation details how the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance would jointly manage RESBit, ensuring transparency through regular biannual reports to both the public and Congress. In addition, the text addresses the need for educational and innovation programs, including specialized courses on blockchain, crypto-economics, and cybersecurity, as well as incentives like tax benefits for crypto-related startups. Related Reading: Trump Endorses Pro-Bitcoin Senator Lummis: ‘Make US The Crypto Capital’ A technical advisory committee composed of experts in blockchain, digital economy, and cybersecurity would also be established to ensure rigorous oversight and to foster collaboration with international regulators and research institutions. The proposal cites global precedents, such as El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, the United States’ approval of BTC ETFs, China’s investment in blockchain and digital currency efforts, Dubai’s success in developing a blockchain-friendly business environment, and the EU’s regulatory framework for digital assets. In its justification section, the bill argues that Brazil is already one of the countries with the highest rate of cryptocurrency adoption , yet government policy has not kept pace with the rapid evolution of this market. According to the text, “The creation of RESBit will allow Brazil to diversify its international reserves, reducing exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and geopolitical risks while increasing economic resilience.

Galaxy Digital , a crypto investment firm founded by Michael Novogratz , has agreed to a $200 million settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office over allegations it promoted the algorithmic cryptocurrency LUNA ( LUNA ) while quietly selling millions of tokens at a profit. The firm did not admit or deny the allegations. The settlement, outlined in a filing from the NYAG, claims Galaxy bought LUNA in 2020. At the same time, it promoted and sold its holdings without disclosing its intent to sell, thereby violating the Martin Act and New York Executive Law, according to the NYAG. In the settlement agreement, the regulator says Michael Novogratz was among LUNA’s most vocal supporters, admitting in a moment that Galaxy “helped ‘kickstart’ interest in Luna through its marketing efforts.” You might also like: Mike Novogratz: FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried ‘needs to be prosecuted’ While publicly expressing confidence in LUNA, Galaxy queitly sold “millions of tokens into the market at many multiples of its initial cost without disclosing that it was selling,” the filing reads. Galaxy reportedly bought 18.5 million LUNA tokens at a discount and sold most of them in tranches, making over $100 million by March 2022. By the time LUNA collapsed in May 2022, Galaxy had already exited almost its entire position. “Ultimately, Galaxy helped a little-known token increase its market price from $0.31 in October 2020 to $119.18 in April 2022, while profiting in the hundreds of millions of dollars,” the NYAG claims. Under the settlement, Galaxy will pay $200 million over three years, starting with $40 million in two weeks. The firm also agreed to implement policies to prevent conflicts of interest, including legal analysis of token investments and promotional statements. As of press time, Galaxy Digital made no public statements on the matter.

This report coincides with an update on Tally , where the DAO’s voting period for a proposal to adopt Timeboost as a revenue source for Arbitrum has been extended to March 29, 2025. Arbitrum DAO has been operating at a loss every quarter since Q3 2023. Source: Entropy Advisors Growth in the midst of losses In a detailed breakdown shared on X, Entropy Advisors revealed that Arbitrum DAO had spent $231 million while generating $107 million in revenue, with deficits similar to growth-focused startups. To ensure transparency, the advisors shared a series of dashboards outlining revenue generation, expenditures, and overall financial health. These dashboards included insights into income sources, expense categories, an income statement, and a treasury runway projection. While some view the current losses as a natural phase of Arbitrum ’s growth strategy, Entropy Advisors stresses the importance of smart spending to secure sustainable expansion. They also got a projected treasury runway for the DAO, with the platform surviving for 8 years should it run on its lowest income from the past 24 months. The full analysis of Entropy Advisors’ report is available as a dashboard on the on-chain analytics platform , Dune. L2 base fee is the leading driver of revenue The income sources are transaction fees on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, and they are categorized into L1 base fee, L1 surplus fee, L2 base fee and L2 surplus fee. Among these, L2 surplus fee was the major revenue driver according to the data shared by Entropy Advisors. The transaction fees altogether constituted the largest source of revenue, accounting for about 95% of the income breakdown. Given that L2 surplus fee is the leading source of income, its value is projected to skyrocket on the condition that there’s more demand for blockspace. Arbitrum’s monthly revenue. Source: Entropy Advisor While L2 surplus fee increased and is projected to increase further, L1 base fee has decreased by over 90% with blobs. However, the gross profit margin has increased from ~25% to ~80%. According to Entropy Advisors, the gross revenue has decreased and the DAO’s profit has been relatively unchanged as a result of margin expansion. The DAO also plans to increase its spending by including Timeboost as a revenue stream in the near future, and currently, the DAO is voting on that decision. Timeboost and Nova Fee Sweep have been touted to be income streams for the Arbitrum DAO. Timeboost has been in existence since 2024 and enables auctions for the rights to an express lane on both Arbitrum One and Nova, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion. Incentives take the lead Incentives are the Arbitrum DAO’s biggest expense at $141M (85%). Source: Entropy Advisors The DAO’s expenses came in the form of blockchain-related costs such as Orbit developer guild payments; DAO operations such as DAO expansion programs, development and consulting services among others; incentive programs; financial management expenses such as treasury management and finance functions; grants such as event sponsorships, technology development, retroactive allocations and structured programs, among others. According to the data presented by Entropy Advisors, apart from blockchain costs, incentives were the largest expense source, taking up to $141 million (85%). This is followed by grants, which took up to $13 million. Despite running at a loss since 2023, 2025 is expected to be Arbitrum DAO’s most profitable year yet, driven largely by a reduction in incentive spending.

In a recent interview on FOX Business, shared by crypto analyst AllinCrypto, Garlinghouse emphasized that the current financial infrastructure is still heavily reliant on SWIFT , a system that has been in place for decades. He pointed out that the cross-border payments market involves trillions of dollars in transactions and that new technologies can enhance efficiency. Garlinghouse explained that despite the slow pace of change, the opportunity to modernize financial systems is significant. He stated that government resistance to innovation in the United States has historically hindered progress. However, he noted that this situation is shifting, which he attributed to what he called “the Trump effect.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says SWIFT architecture is outdated and is confident that $XRP will usher in a new era of finance across the globe: ""there's an opportunity to modernize"" ""The Trump effect is profound."" pic.twitter.com/v7msnhyCVN — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) March 25, 2025 The Impact of the Trump Administration on Crypto Adoption According to Garlinghouse, President Donald Trump’s reelection has substantially impacted the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector.

He described this as a significant shift and suggested that many people have underestimated the scale of change that is now underway. He predicted that blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies will play a long-term role in transforming financial infrastructure, not just in payments but also in real estate and securities transactions. The Future of Ripple and Financial Innovation Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple is already seeing increased domestic interest, marking a departure from when much of its growth came from international markets. He believes that this trend will continue as the U.S. regulatory environment evolves. Garlinghouse expects financial technology innovations to unfold over the next decade or more. He indicated that these advancements will fundamentally reshape how transactions are settled across multiple industries. While acknowledging that progress takes time, he remained confident that the U.S. financial system is now “unlocked” and on a path toward widespread modernization. His comments reflect a broader expectation that blockchain-based solutions, including those leveraging XRP, will gain traction as businesses and institutions seek more efficient alternatives to legacy financial systems.

Dogecoin’s recent double-digit pump and Shiba Inu’s massive uptick in active wallets have sparked renewed hype across crypto forums and TikTok threads. With altcoin season heating up and retail money pouring back into meme assets, all eyes are on the next wave of viral coins that could deliver massive returns. But one meme coin has flipped the script— Arctic Pablo Coin. It doesn’t just ride hype; it builds a story. Arctic Pablo isn’t a stage-based presale. It’s a full-blown mythical journey. Each presale phase is a new “location” Pablo travels to, unlocking mysteries, igniting the community, and burning tokens left behind like breadcrumbs in the frost. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Adventure Token Built for Massive Returns In a world dominated by static tokens and cookie-cutter memecoins, Arctic Pablo Coin is a mythical phenomenon with serious profit potential. With every move Pablo makes globally—through icy caverns, mystic beaches, and lost ruins—a new presale location opens, giving new investors a shot at riding this frosty wave early. Currently stationed at Crystal Cove—its 16th mysterious location— Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is priced at just $0.000083. Over $2 million has already been raised, and with a listing price of $0.008, early investors could be staring down a jaw-dropping 9552.41% ROI. That means a simple $100 investment today could morph into $9,638.55. If there was ever a time to get in, it’s now—because this location could close out any moment. With a total supply of 221.2 billion tokens, Arctic Pablo has allocated 50% to public presale and built out its ecosystem with crystal-clear intent. Marketing, development, staking, and community rewards are hardcoded into the tokenomics. And for diamond hands? A 66% APY staking program is ready to reward true believers. Stake those tokens and stack gains while the Pablo story unfolds—staking will be vested for two months post-launch. As the only meme coin combining mythical storytelling, deflationary mechanics, high APY, and location-based scarcity, Arctic Pablo Coin is rewriting what meme coins can be. Early believers are already stacking six-figure gains. And with each new location, that opportunity resets for the next wave of holders. This presale location won’t last forever. Arctic Pablo could advance to the next location at any moment, which means the current $0.000083 price is the last low point before the next jump. This is the ticket for anyone eyeing top new meme coins for massive return potential . Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin Still Has Gas in the Tank It’s wild to think that Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013 and now holds a market cap north of $24 billion. As of March 2025, DOGE has rallied yet again—up 38% month-over-month—thanks to Elon Musk’s continued love affair with it and integration whispers with X (formerly Twitter). When Dogecoin moves, the entire meme coin ecosystem wakes up. Dogecoin’s current price hovers around $0.17, a far cry from its May 2021 all-time high of $0.73, but this distance also signals upside room. Traders are eyeing a breakout to the $0.25-$0.30 range with enough momentum. And the best part? DOGE still has that crazy community drive behind it—meme armies, Reddit raids, and TikTok takeovers. While it lacks the deflationary elements or staking rewards that newer meme coins offer, Dogecoin survives purely on brand legacy and memetic power. It’s liquid, listed everywhere, and commands respect. Anyone looking for top new meme coins for massive return potential shouldn’t underestimate the OG—it’s still barking. Shiba Inu: From Meme to DeFi Powerhouse Shiba Inu has come a long way from being dubbed the “Dogecoin killer.” With the launch of Shibarium—its Layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum—the project has evolved into a serious DeFi contender. As of March 2025, SHIB sits around $0.000025 and is up nearly 45% YTD. That’s not just hype—that’s utility in motion. Shiba Inu’s diversified ecosystem makes it one of the top meme coins for massive return potential. It’s not just SHIB anymore—there’s LEASH, BONE, and now a complete NFT platform, staking dApps, and governance structure through Doggy DAO. This multi-pronged ecosystem attracts DeFi users, NFT collectors, and meme traders. Shibarium has helped solve the Ethereum gas fee issue for SHIB users while accelerating adoption across dApps. SHIB burns are also increasing, with deflationary effects similar to Arctic Pablo—though not as frequent or predictable. This keeps SHIB relevant in conversations about sustainable long-term value. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on This Meme Coin Gold Rush Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the top new meme coins for massive return potential. Its mythical storytelling, weekly token burns, 66% APY staking, and a presale model that travels through Earth’s mysteries make it not just a coin—but a movement. Dogecoin remains the legendary gatekeeper of the meme coin world, while Shiba Inu continues building its DeFi kingdom brick by brick. But Arctic Pablo Coin? That’s where the magic’s happening now. With over $2 million already raised, a price of just $0.000083, and a projected ROI of 9552.41%, this could be the final moment to jump in before the next presale location bumps the price. Join the Pablo meme coin presale now and become part of crypto’s most legendary expedition. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs: What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin uses a location-based presale journey, weekly token burns, and 66% APY staking—offering a mix of narrative and real ROI. How much can you earn by investing in Arctic Pablo Coin now? Investing $100 now could yield $9,638.55 by launch, based on the current price of $0.000083 and listing price of $0.008. Is Dogecoin still a good investment in 2025? Yes, Dogecoin remains highly liquid, community-driven, and continues to gain momentum with social media backing.

The firm also said that it will add up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari. The car company said it can withstand President Trump’s upcoming tariffs since its wealthy customer base is unlikely to be discouraged by higher prices. Ferrari’s stock prices surged slightly Thursday morning, reaching 391.50 euros at the time of publication, a 1.82% surge. Ferrari increases prices by 10% in response to U.S. auto tariffs We're screwed — Ferrari Plans to Raise US Prices Up to 10% After Tariffs Hit Ferrari NV plans to raise prices for some of its cars by as much as 10% to deal with US President Donald Trump’s latest auto tariffs. https://t.co/AITnUE5vAk — Jim Bianco (@biancoresearch) March 27, 2025 Italy-based sports car maker Ferrari revealed that it will hike the price of certain models by 10% to countermeasure Donald Trump’s auto tariffs. The car company disclosed that it will increase prices up to $50K for a typical Ferrari. The firm also maintained that prices will remain unchanged for all cars imported before April 3, the day Trump’s tariffs are expected to take effect. The Italian luxury sports car maker said that after that, the “commercial terms” for three of its model families, the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, will “remain unchanged.” “For the current remaining models, the new import conditions will be partially reflected on pricing, up to a maximum 10 per cent increase, in coordination with our dealer network.” – Ferrari The company said popular models, including the Purosangue SUV, the 12Cilindri and the F80, will get price increases of up to 10%. Ferrari’s Purosangue, which is priced around $430,000, will have a price hike of about $43,000. The firm’s limited edition F80, which starts above $3.5 million, will get a price increase of more than $350,000. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued 25% tariffs on all cars not made in the country. More than half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as well as 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the country. The Italian luxury sports car maker runs all its auto production at its Maranello factory in Italy, in the province of Modena. The car automaker revealed last year it produced 13,752 cars. The Italy-based firm also plans to launch its first all-electric Ferrari in October. Ferrari’s upcoming EV vehicle, which will be manufactured in Italy, is among six new models the firm plans to launch this year. Ferrari’s 2025 financial target remains unchanged The company did not provide more information on the effect the tariffs will have on its sales since most of its vehicles have already been on a waiting list for more than a year. Ferrari also highlighted on March 27 that its financial targets for 2025 will remain unchanged but added that there was a potential reduction of 50 basis points in profitability percentage margins. The Italian luxury sports car maker has also forecasted adjusted earnings of around 2.68 billion euros ($2.88 billion), a surge of at least 5%. The firm also forecast a net revenue of more than 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for the full year. Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said earlier this month that even though its buyers are wealthy, the firm has to be sensitive to passing on too much of the added cost of tariffs. The car company also reported a significant increase in 2024 net profit and cited a strong product mix and growing demand for personal touches to its vehicles. JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a Thursday note that they envision some Ferrari buyers will decide to delay taking delivery. Bernstein analyst Stephen Reitman argued that U.S. customers won’t be pushed away by higher prices. He believes that Ferrari’s customers tend to be wealthier individuals who will be less impacted by tariffs, which will put more pressure on poorer customers. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman also lowered the December price target for General Motors (GM) to $53 per share from $64 per share, for Ford Motors to $11 per share from $13 per share, and for Ferrari to $460 per share from $525 per share. Brinkman also suggested that the auto industry might take an annual hit of $82 billion, up from an initial estimate of $41 billion, assuming that automakers absorb the cost of the tariffs. The analyst also believes light-vehicle prices could surge by up to 11.4% if companies decide to pass the cost on to consumers. Ford CEO Jim Farley stated in February that “let’s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While Hayes has long stressed the crucial role of liquidity in driving the Bitcoin price, his latest remarks go even further, suggesting a new phase of expansion is imminent. Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle Is History Hayes believes that Bitcoin’s original four-year “halving cycle” framework has been overshadowed by the asset’s ascent into mainstream financial consciousness. According to him, early on, Bitcoin’s market dynamics were more closely tied to mining profitability cycles. However, those days appear largely gone: “Now that Bitcoin and crypto are a bona fide asset class…everyone’s responding to it,” Hayes said. “It has transitioned from this technological digital bearer asset into the best smoke alarm for fiat liquidity that we have globally.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Make Big Moves As Bullish Momentum Resurfaces Rather than focus on halving events, Hayes urges investors to track how many dollars, euros, yen, and yuan are actively being created—or destroyed—by the world’s major central banks. In his view, the Federal Reserve, the People’s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank drive the most significant flows: “All I care about is fiat liquidity. As long as we believe [Bitcoin] works, then it just comes down to how many fiat things are in the denominator, and then you just get to the price.” According to Hayes, markets are underestimating the US Federal Reserve’s willingness to revert to looser monetary policy far sooner than publicly stated. He calls recent Fed moves “stealth printing,” arguing that Chair Jerome Powell is quietly laying groundwork to keep credit conditions easy—even though official language still references inflation concerns. Hayes pointed to signs in the Fed’s communications that quantitative tightening (QT) will slow or even pause. One such indicator is Powell’s mention of offsetting any reduction in mortgage-backed securities with fresh purchases of US Treasuries: “They said they might taper QT to be flat That’s very positive for dollar liquidity.” He also noted Powell’s statements that any inflation arising from tariffs would be considered “transitory”—in effect granting the Fed cover to maintain accommodative policies: “Tariffs don’t matter anymore to Powell, and they shouldn’t matter anymore as crypto investors […] because we know that Powell’s going to continue to provide the monetary conditions […] that we need to have our portfolios go up in value in fiat dollar terms.” The Bottom Is (Probably) In In Hayes’s estimation, the worst of Bitcoin’s recent downturn may already be behind us. Although he concedes that the market could still retest lows, he contends that Bitcoin has likely established a key floor: “On balance, we probably hit a bottom of 76,000 […] Does that mean that we’re not going to retest it? No, of course not, but if I had to make a bet, I would bet that we go higher rather than lower.” For Hayes, this is a question of recognizing a turning point in monetary policy. Once the Federal Reserve and other central banks signal they are fully done tightening—“or never truly started,” in his phrasing—he expects Bitcoin to climb. Related Reading: One Of Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Buy Signals Just Flashed Hayes also dismissed the idea that looming crypto regulations in the United States or elsewhere could meaningfully stifle Bitcoin’s trajectory. He believes Bitcoin’s permissionless, decentralized design makes it effectively impervious to traditional regulatory blockades: “Crypto regulation doesn’t matter. Bitcoin doesn’t need anyone’s permission. It’s moving with or without them […] If Bitcoin trades on tradfi regulations, then I don’t want to own it. I want something immune to regulation.” In one of his most attention-grabbing statements, Hayes contemplated whether Bitcoin could achieve “a numerically interesting number”—including the possibility of $1 million—during the next wave of dollar-driven liquidity. Although he did not definitively lock in an exact price ceiling, he mentioned that it might be a psychologically resonant figure: “I put $1 million Bitcoin out there- I hope it will be $1 million dollars but you know maybe it’s just 666,000 or 500,000 or 250,000 what some round number that the human mind sees as significant, for some arbitrary reason.” For Hayes, it comes down to global monetary authorities deciding they have “gone too far” in trying to rein in spending and inflation. Once central banks resume large-scale liquidity injections, he argues, the stage is set for rapid upside in Bitcoin’s price. Arthur Hayes’s perspective centers on the idea that Bitcoin’s fate hinges almost exclusively on global liquidity conditions. He remains convinced that central bankers, especially at the Fed, are closer to providing a renewed wave of monetary stimulus than the market believes—paving the way for a dramatic Bitcoin rally. While volatility remains inherent, Hayes insists that the largest cryptocurrency is poised to move swiftly once the policy backdrop aligns. “If you know what to look for, the clues are everywhere. The bottom is in, liquidity is coming back, and Bitcoin… it’s already turning the corner.” Where that corner leads, according to Hayes, could be as high as $1 million—starting, he suggests, as soon as April. At press time, BTC traded at $85,765.

While it has currently stabilized at around $0.10, the latest price action has pushed its weekly gains to nearly 40%. This rise in CRO’s value comes on the heels of a major development involving Crypto.com, the parent company behind the cryptocurrency. SEC Ends Probe into Crypto.com The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially closed its investigation into the crypto exchange and has informed the company that no enforcement action would be taken against it. This marks a major moment after months of tension between the two entities. In October 2024, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC after receiving a Wells notice, which indicated the regulator’s intent to sue the platform for operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and securities clearing agency. The lawsuit argued that the SEC had unlawfully extended its jurisdiction and imposed an overreaching rule classifying nearly all crypto transactions as securities trades, regardless of how they were sold. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek publicly condemned the regulator’s actions and called for an end to its overreach. However, by December 2024, Crypto.com dropped its lawsuit, a month after the re-election of Donald Trump as US President. The SEC, under the Biden administration, had previously targeted various cryptocurrency companies, including Kraken, Coinbase, and Uniswap, with enforcement actions and lawsuits. However, after Trump returned to office, the legal landscape for crypto companies shifted dramatically, with many cases being shut down. Following the development, Nick Lundgren, Chief Legal Officer of Crypto.com, accused the SEC of weaponizing and attempting to expand its congressionally granted power to harm an industry that its former chair “disfavored.” The exec even went on to add, “It is unfortunate that we were forced to endure this years-long investigation and file our own suit against the SEC to protect the rule of law. Compliance and integrity are core to Crypto.com’s business and we are excited to work with soon-to-be-confirmed Chair Atkins and the rest of the Commission on our long-awaited desire for legislation and rulemaking.” Backlash Over Re-Issuance of 70 Billion CRO Tokens Crypto.com was recently under fire for the re-issuance of 70 billion CRO tokens, which sparked fierce criticism from the crypto community. For instance, ZachXBT, a prominent blockchain investigator, accused the company of betraying its users, and claimed the move was no different from a scam. This controversial decision resurrected tokens that had been burned in 2021 to decrease the total supply. Critics argue that it goes against the community’s wishes for decentralization and transparency, with reports indicating that Crypto.com’s validators control a large portion of the voting power. Despite this, Marszalek defended the decision, stating that it was necessary to support the company’s growth strategy.

Among the largest unsecured creditors are Alexander Svanevik of Standard Crypto and Ashley Swaren, a commercial lead at TokenTerminal. In January 2024, Terraform Labs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., reporting assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. By September 2024, a U.S. bankruptcy court approved the company’s plan to wind down its operations following a $4.47 billion settlement with the SEC over fraud allegations related to the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin. The SEC alleged that in 2021, Terraform Labs and Do Kwon misled investors about TerraUSD’s ability to maintain its $1 peg. Specifically, after TerraUSD dropped below $1 for the first time in May 2021, Kwon and Terraform secretly arranged for a third party to purchase large amounts of TerraUSD to restore its peg, while publicly misrepresenting the recovery as a result of the algorithm’s effectiveness. The agency also claimed that Kwon and the company falsely stated that Terraform’s blockchain was integrated into a widely used Korean mobile payment app Chai.

UST was an algorithmic stablecoin, meaning it wasn’t backed by reserves like cash or assets. Instead, it relied on a mint-and-burn mechanism with its sister token, LUNA. When UST demand increased, LUNA was burned to mint new UST. Conversely, when UST supply needed to shrink, UST was burned to mint LUNA. In early May 2022, large withdrawals from Anchor Protocol (a lending platform that offered 20% APY on UST deposits) created sell pressure on UST. UST started to depeg from $1, dropping to $0.98, then lower. Traders panicked and rushed to sell UST, causing even more instability. To restore UST’s peg, Terraform Labs minted massive amounts of LUNA to absorb the sell-off. But this flooded the market with LUNA, causing its price to plummet from $80+ to fractions of a cent. Even after Terraform Labs deployed $3 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserves to restore UST’s peg, it failed. Co-founder Do Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 and was extradited to the U.S. in late 2024, facing fraud and money laundering charges.

The problem resulted from a rogue trader who self-traded a sizable JELLY position, which caused a price spike, setting off a liquidation process that led to Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) market-making vault absorbing the loss. In a Mar. 27 post on X, the platform outlined several steps it has taken to improve its risk management. Stricter limits on the liquidator vault, which serves as an emergency fund to cover losses from failed trades, is one of the key updates. By reducing the cap, Hyperliquid hopes to keep the vault from assuming undue risks that could compromise the platform’s overall stability. Vault rebalancing has also been decreased. In the past, risk was harder to predict because frequent rebalancing led to sudden changes in exposure. Slowing down this process should create a more stable risk management system. Another major improvement is how liquidation vault triggers work. Before, if the liquidator vault took a loss, it would automatically pull funds from other vaults. Now, if losses reach a certain level, automatic liquidation will kick in. Instead of distributing risks to other vaults, this update helps to contain them. You might also like: Bitget CEO says Hyperliquid could become FTX 2.0 amid JELLY incident Hyperliquid is also improving its open interest caps, which set the maximum amount that traders can bet on a single asset. Now, these caps will dynamically adjust according to market conditions, lowering the chance that the system will be disrupted by sharp price swings. Furthermore, validators will be able to decide when to remove risky assets through a new voting system. To avoid further issues, a token may be delisted if it drops below safety thresholds. Hyperliquid continues to face difficulties despite these updates. According to DeFi Llama data , the total value locked in its liquidity vault has dropped from a peak of $540 million in February to $180 million as of Mar. 28. USDC outflows, which surpassed $340 million just hours after the hack, are continuing, with 61.7 million USDC leaving the platform in the last 24 hours, as per Parsec data . HYPE is struggling to recover as well. The token was trading at around $16 before the incident. It has now fallen to $13.98 as at the time of press, a 3% decrease over the past 24 hours and 59.83% below its peak of $34.96. Additionally, there has been a significant drop in HYPE trading activity, with volume dropping 79.8% to $94.3 million over the past day.

This decision aligns with many companies like MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and others. Interestingly, the investors initially took it as positive news, but later, the GME stock price plunged. What’s happening, and will it recover? Why Did the GME Stock Price Crash 25% Today? In contrast to the GME stock price’s 16% rally on March 26, it has crashed by 25% today. The earlier boost came right after the announcement as investors considered it a highly bullish opportunity. Interestingly, along with this, the GameStop-inspired GME memecoin price surged 30%. At that time, the Gamestop short sale volume surged to $30.85M on March 27 after a massive 234% volume surge. Interestingly, this level was closer to the 2021 short squeeze. Additionally, the GameStop stock trading volume peaked amid the price surge. However, this all came falling with Gamtesop’s plan to raise $1.3M to buy Bitcoin for its treasury. The investor’s sentiments were impacted as the company is issuing debt to buy as they intended to offer $1.3M aggregated principal convertible senior notes due in 2030. The same reaction was noticed during MicroStrategy’s note issues. Experts co-relate these events before predicting a massive GME stock price uptrend. In 2021, MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes, the stock dipped after the announcement due to hedging shorts, but later exploded when Bitcoin ripped and the arbitrage unspooled. What’s Experts Take on GameStop Bitcoin Buying? Although there are mixed sentiments around this GameStop Bitcoin buying news, experts have appreciated this approach.
