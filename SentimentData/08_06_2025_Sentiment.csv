45656340,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107104,1749332559,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Ether Outshines BTC & XRP Institutional Products Following $321 Million Pump,https://zycrypto.com/ether-outshines-btc-xrp-institutional-products-following-321-million-pump/,"Crypto investment products recorded $286 million net inflows, with Ether leading the pack while Bitcoin (BTC) picked up losses. The New York court decision on President Trump’s tariff plan boosted investor sentiment mid-week. Last week’s fund flows highlighted a slight geographical shift, although the United States remained dominant due to institutional demand. A String Of Consecutive Weekly Inflows The digital asset market remains bullish following recent global institutional investment. A recent CoinShares Fund Flows shows a $286 million inflow, marking the seventh consecutive weekly gain. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, saw swift exits, recording $8 million outflows. Bitcoin started the week in the green zone on the heels of institutional accumulation but lost steam after a New York court decided on recent White House tariffs. Still, Bitcoin price trades within the $106k zone, though down from its $111k all-time high. Bulls are optimistic due to publicly-listed firms acquiring the assets. Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased 705 BTC on Monday, taking holdings to 580,955 BTC. Although the buy was the smallest in several weeks, Strategy bolstered wider interest. Japanese Metaplanet also scooped up more assets in the same period. Meanwhile, Ether was the highest gainer last week as institutional funds attracted a massive $321 million. This brings the figure for the last six weeks to $1.19 billion as investors remain keen on an altcoin resurgence. Monthly figures are now up to $889 million while assets under management jumped above $14 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States also notched gains within the week. Last month, the general spike in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities was a major ETH driver. This string of bullish inflows marks the highest Ether run since December 2024. XRP Loses Institutional Momentum Per the data, XRP shed $28 million in the last seven days, stretching monthly losses, while year-to-date figures remain in the green zone. XRP saw huge gains earlier this year on the back of an expected spot ETF approval, but lost momentum after delayed decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Odds are still in favor for an approval this year. “ Regionally, investor focus shifted somewhat away from the US, which still recorded inflows of US$199m last week. Germany and Australia saw inflows of US$42.9m and US$21.5m, respectively. Meanwhile, Hong Kong experienced its strongest weekly post-seed inflows since the launch of exchange-traded products just over a year ago, totalling US$54.8 million.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-07 21:42:39

Dogecoin (DOGE), the iconic meme-turned-mainstay, is trading at around $0.19 a far cry from its rumored $5 price target, yet analysts still forecast a more grounded move toward $0.78 by year’s end. While DOGE banks on community loyalty and potential ETF exposure, a new altcoin is starting to dominate the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With whispers of a 44x ROI potential, MUTM is quickly becoming a top contender for those wondering what crypto to invest in before the next market surge. Dogecoin Targets $5 as 2025 Heats Up Even through market ups and downs, Dogecoin (DOGE), remains one of the most notable cryptocurrencies to look at. DOGE is trading around $0.195 in June 2025 and due to its strong fan base, previous volatility and possible upswing, people are discussing how it might hit the $5 mark. Even though many think DOGE will stay around $0.80 in the near term, some enthusiasts believe that the introduction of crypto ETFs, updated laws and a revival in the retail market will launch another huge rally. Investors are talking a lot lately about the best crypto to acquire now and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is joining the conversation as a coin with great potential. MUTM’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale, following a sell-out of Phase 4. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 3 investors upon the token’s launch. With over $10.1 million raised and a growing community of 11,700+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway —each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens in recognition of their foundational role in the project. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key pillars of the ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of Mutuum Finance. Dogecoin and Mutuum Finance are both gaining attention in 2025, but for very different reasons. DOGE, sitting around $0.19, still benefits from its strong community and the hope of another breakout—though most analysts see it more realistically reaching $0.78 by year’s end. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a newer DeFi project offering real use cases and strong growth potential. It’s already raised over $10.1 million and attracted more than 11,700 investors. At $0.03 per token in Phase 5 of its presale, early buyers could see a 2x return at launch—and possibly much more if growth continues. For those looking ahead, MUTM might be the more practical pick.

Amid the current price action, crypto analyst Decode has provided insights into whether the leading crypto will rally to $120,000 or drop below $100,000 next. Analyst Reveals What’s Next For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Decode shared an accompanying chart in which he made an ABC wave analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, the leading crypto is expected to drop below $100,000 before it rallies to a new ATH of $120,000. The chart showed that BTC could fall to as low as $96,500 on the Wave B corrective move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next This drop to $96,500 is expected to happen this month. Once that is done, Decode predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally above $120,500 before the end of July. This will mark the Wave C impulsive move to the upside. This aligns with veteran trader Peter Brandt’s prediction that BTC could reach as high as $150,000 by late summer. However, crypto analyst KillaXBT has predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit the $120,000 target by mid-June. This coincides with the June FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18. A Fed rate cut could serve as the catalyst for such a parabolic rally from the current BTC price level. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 97.4% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged. As such, market participants aren’t expecting a rate cut, which is why the Bitcoin price could pump massively if Jerome Powell and the FOMC were to surprise everyone. Moreover, US President Donald Trump yesterday urged the Fed to cut rates by a full point. A Breakout Might Be On The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that a breakout could be imminent for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is progressing inside a 4-hour falling wedge, which indicates a bullish reversal pattern. If confirmed, the analyst stated that the breakout could target the $107,500 and $109,500 zones, which are the Fibonacci confluence areas. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the solid V-shape recovery for the Bitcoin price after the leading crypto dropped to as low as $100,000 on May 5. However, the analyst noted that BTC’s rebound back to the $105,000 zone won’t matter until it breaks above the $106,800 level. The leading crypto must also show actual follow-through with 3-day to 1-week closes to support a breakout. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,000. Up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

45656719,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70232,1749333628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Cardano’s (ADA) Unsteady Momentum Opens the Door for Ruvi AI (RUVI), Is This the Next Bull Run Leader?",https://timestabloid.com/cardanos-ada-unsteady-momentum-opens-the-door-for-ruvi-ai/,"Cardano has long been hailed as one of the most promising blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency industry. Its methodical development and focus on scalability earned it a loyal following. However, recent market trends suggest Cardano’s momentum is slowing, leaving room for emerging projects like Ruvi AI to take the spotlight. With its robust technology and growing investor interest, Ruvi AI appears set to lead the next bull run. Here’s why. Ruvi AI’s Presale Is Off to an Explosive Start Unlike Cardano, which is grappling with its next growth phase, Ruvi AI is surging forward with an immensely successful Phase 2 presale . To date, the project has raised $1.5 million and sold nearly 135 million tokens , signaling strong investor confidence and excitement. At a remarkably low entry price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI’s presale is designed for accessibility and growth. What sets this presale apart is its $0.07 valuation upon conclusion , a programmed feature rather than mere speculation. Analysts further project a $1 valuation post-listing , emphasizing Ruvi AI’s potential for astronomical returns. Early investors are seizing the opportunity to get in before prices climb steeply. Real-World Applications That Solve Big Problems While Cardano has focused on establishing a strong technical foundation, Ruvi AI is leveraging its integration of AI and blockchain technology to tackle real-world challenges across multiple industries. These tangible solutions set Ruvi AI apart and broaden its appeal: Healthcare : Ruvi AI bolsters patient care with advanced diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows, reducing inefficiencies while ensuring better outcomes. Logistics : The platform optimizes supply chain operations, saving businesses time and money while enhancing delivery efficiency. Finance : With cutting-edge fraud detection systems, Ruvi AI offers enhanced safety and efficiency in financial networks. These use cases ensure Ruvi AI isn’t just another speculative token. It’s delivering practical advancements that make a measurable difference, positioning it for sustainable growth and adoption. Cardano’s Challenges Could Be Ruvi AI’s Opportunity Despite its strengths, Cardano has faced significant hurdles as it tries to maintain investor trust and expand its ecosystem. Critics point to delays in delivering updates and projects, which have raised questions about its momentum and ability to compete with newer players. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, benefits from being in its early stages, with the advantage of executing a clearly defined and transparent roadmap. By focusing on immediate deliverables and securing major milestones like its first exchange partnership , Ruvi AI is creating a strong launchpad for future growth. Rewarding Investors with VIP Tiers To encourage participation during its presale, Ruvi AI offers a rewarding VIP investment tier system , maximizing returns for early supporters. Here’s how the numbers stack up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers not only reward investor confidence but also strengthen Ruvi AI’s ability to attract serious backers who believe in its long-term potential. Why Ruvi AI Is Positioned as a Leader in the Next Bull Run Ruvi AI has all the makings of a standout project in the cryptocurrency space. Its ability to address real-world needs, coupled with its successful presale structure, builds a solid case for sustained growth. Cardano’s slower momentum opens the door wide for Ruvi AI to step in and become a leader in the next bull run. What makes Ruvi AI particularly appealing is the timing of its presale. With a low buy-in price and an already-built roadmap for value growth, it offers a rare chance to invest in a project before its breakout success. The $1 valuation analysts forecast after listing could be just the beginning.

Certain projects are separating themselves from the crowd with meaningful upgrades, strategic partnerships, and investor attention. While much of the market remains range-bound, a handful of cryptocurrencies are showing technical strength and fundamental development that signal possible outperformance in the near term. In this guide, we highlight four good cryptos to buy now, based on their unique market positions and upcoming catalysts. These include presale momentum, platform-wide upgrades, and renewed institutional interest. BlockDAG, Sonic, NEAR, and BNB are all good options as each project is navigating current conditions with a clear roadmap, and the potential upside in the coming months is drawing growing attention from analysts and traders alike. 1. BlockDAG – Final Presale Window Before GO LIVE Reveal BlockDAG continues to stand out as one of the most talked-about projects of the year. With more than $288.5 million raised and 22 billion BDAG coins sold so far, it’s nearing the conclusion of its presale at a price of $0.0018, which will remain in place until June 13. On that day, the GO LIVE reveal is scheduled, announcing 20 upcoming exchange launches. For early buyers, $1,000 still secures over 555,000 coins, with a projected listing target of $0.05. The conversation has already shifted toward the possibility of a $0.25 valuation soon. From a technical perspective, BlockDAG uses a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work consensus model, optimizing for scalability and energy efficiency. It currently has over 1.5 million mobile users on the X1 app, which allows easy mobile mining without any effort or cost. Analysts are bullish about BlockDAG’s future, with some pointing at future predictions as high as $10. With fundamentals and presale economics aligned, BlockDAG stands as one of the best-positioned contenders when evaluating good crypto to buy now. 2. Sonic – Airdrop Engagement and Strategic Investment Fuel Momentum Sonic is making significant waves in Q2 of 2025. Trading near $0.406 with a market cap of approximately $1.17 billion, its ecosystem has gained serious momentum in the wake of a 200 million token airdrop. The distribution structure favors long-term commitment, unlocking 25% upfront and the remainder over 270 days, reducing short-term sell pressure and reinforcing project stability. Sonic also secured a $10 million strategic investment from Galaxy Digital, intended to expand its presence in the U.S. and strengthen its DeFi stack. A confirmed listing on Kraken earlier in May added to its visibility. The project, formerly Fantom, is rebranding and restructuring, which is helping to reinforce its long-term relevance. From a price action standpoint, Sonic is approaching a key breakout level at $0.41. A confirmed move above this could flip resistance into a new support zone. With investor incentives, institutional backing, and a growing user base, Sonic presents itself as a good crypto to buy now, especially heading into the next quarter. 3. Near Protocol – Network Growth and ETF Catalysts Boost Market Outlook NEAR Protocol is showing strong usage metrics and technical recovery. Priced around $2.55 with a market cap exceeding $3.1 billion, NEAR has processed more than 40 million transactions in just the past week. This puts it alongside Solana and Tron among the most active blockchain platforms, a testament to increasing developer and user engagement. The next evolution for the network is the rollout of Nightshade 2.0, its sharding upgrade scheduled for the end of 2025. At the same time, ETF speculation is heating up. Bitwise has filed for a NEAR-backed ETF, potentially opening the door to institutional capital and mainstream adoption. Technically, NEAR is trading above its 9-day exponential moving average, and resistance is sitting at $2.73. A sustained break beyond this level would strengthen the bullish trend. Given its combination of strong fundamentals, potential regulatory catalysts, and price setup, NEAR makes a strong case as a good crypto to buy now in a forward-looking portfolio. 4. Binance Coin – Legal Resolution and Network Upgrades Drive Confidence Binance Coin (BNB) is currently priced at $671.63 and has rebounded strongly following a pivotal legal development. In late May, the SEC officially dismissed its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, removing a significant overhang that had affected sentiment for over two years. With that chapter closed, attention has returned to the platform’s innovation and performance. The Lorentz Hard Fork, launched in May, doubled the throughput of the BNB Chain and introduced AI-integrated smart contracts. These upgrades are positioning BNB Chain as a more dynamic environment for decentralized applications. Additionally, VanEck has filed for a spot BNB ETF, signaling renewed institutional interest. Technical indicators show support around $654, with near-term targets between $730 and $801. With legal risk out of the way and infrastructure getting smarter, BNB has returned to the radar as a good crypto to buy now for both retail and institutional players aiming to re-engage with top-tier platforms. Final Analysis: Which Projects Have the Strongest Setup Right Now? In a market filled with thousands of options, very few cryptocurrencies combine technical innovation, user activity, and upcoming catalysts as effectively as BlockDAG, Sonic, NEAR, and Binance Coin. Whether you are evaluating entry points based on presale potential, institutional involvement, or network activity, each of these projects stands out in its category. BlockDAG offers one of the final low-cost buying windows ahead of its GO LIVE reveal. Sonic is ramping up visibility through airdrops and capital inflows. NEAR has entered the ETF conversation and is processing volumes that few chains can match. BNB, now free from legal pressure, is upgrading at a pace that restores confidence. These are not just speculative bets. They are grounded in development, backed by metrics, and structured for future performance. As you assess good crypto to buy now for your 2025 strategy, this group deserves close and ongoing attention.

The size and timing of the transfer have sparked intense speculation: is this part of a broader institutional strategy, a liquidity shuffle, or something more strategic? As Ripple’s activity draws attention, XRP’s price movement is beginning to reflect cautious optimism. With bulls eyeing a breakout past key resistance, this development could mark the beginning of a new phase—not just for XRP, but for other altcoins as well. XRP Shows Steady Climb, Eyeing $2.48 as Bulls Struggle to Break Resistance Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.05 and $2.33, showing slight growth in the past week. Bulls are attempting to push past the $2.48 resistance level. However, they're finding it challenging. The price has risen modestly by around 2% in the past week and month. The Relative Strength Index sits around 57, indicating a potential upward push yet not overbought. If XRP breaks through the current resistance, it might climb towards the $2.76 mark, which is a sizeable increase from its current position. But for now, the momentum remains sluggish, with the bulls needing more strength to achieve significant growth beyond the modest percentage increases of late. Conclusion While Ripple’s $487 million XRP transfer has yet to reveal its true intent, the market’s reaction hints at growing anticipation. If XRP can overcome the stubborn $2.48 barrier, it could set the stage for a rally toward $2.76 and beyond. Investors are now watching closely—not only to decode Ripple’s next move but also to identify which altcoins might ride the wave of renewed momentum.

As regulators weigh the risks and rewards, Ethereum stands out as a strong candidate to lead this institutional wave. Could ETH be the first crypto to benefit from UK-based ETNs—and what might this mean for the broader market? This article explores the implications of this regulatory pivot and which assets may benefit most from the coming changes. Ethereum Shows Mixed Signals: Bulls and Bears in Tug-of-War Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading between $2410 and $2729.90. While recent movements show slight bearish pressure with a weekly drop of over 1%, the coin has surged by around 38% over the past month. This hints at potential growth, though the path isn't clear-cut. If bulls regain strength, the price might test the next resistance at about $2920. If it can break past that, $3240 is the following target. These changes could mean an increase of over 10% and then around 18%. However, if bears take control, Ethereum might drop to support levels, but the upward momentum in the monthly trend gives hope for future gains. Conclusion The UK's move toward allowing crypto ETNs could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the digital asset space at large. Despite short-term price fluctuations, ETH's long-term trajectory may receive a powerful boost from institutional demand and broader market access. If Ethereum breaks through key resistance levels, the momentum could extend beyond ETH—benefiting a wider range of altcoins poised to thrive in a more regulated, investment-friendly environment.

While investors watched the carmaker's valuation crumble, a handful of lesser-known altcoins began catching their eye, not just as alternatives, but as assets thriving on the very principles of decentralization the feud highlighted. These hidden gems are now poised for growth, offering promising opportunities for investors looking to move beyond the politically-charged volatility of traditional stocks. Graphite Network Rolls Out Reputation-Led Infrastructure to Reinvent Blockchain Trust Tesla’s nosedive after Trump–Musk row revealed a deeper flaw in how financial markets operate. Billions wiped out, not because of product failures or structural flaws, but because two powerful personalities clashed. This is what happens when trust isn’t engineered into the system. Graphite Network was built to solve exactly this kind of chaos. It does not rely on personalities, but rather it uses verifiable execution . Imagine a credit score that shows precisely what data was used, where it came from, and how it was processed. That’s the kind of transparency Graphite Network brings to every corner of its ecosystem. A Blockchain Where Trust Is the Default Setting In contrast to legacy systems where trust is patched on as an afterthought, Graphite Network bakes it in from the start: Reputation-based architecture: Your Trust Score evolves based on optional KYC (via zero-knowledge proofs), account history, and behavior. Higher trust means better experiences. Custom filters and tagged wallets: Want to interact only with verified users? Set your parameters and go. Trust becomes programmable. Zero drama, zero fraud: Transparency and accountability are coded into the network itself. Decentralized Earning For Every Node Graphite Network is both secure and inclusive. It is the first network to enable all node types to earn directly from the blockchain, opening income opportunities across the board. It’s a more sustainable and equitable future for decentralized infrastructure. Built on the Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 consensus, Graphite Network eliminates congestion, slashes energy costs, and reduces common attack vectors. Plus, it’s EVM-compatible, making it a breeze for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and dApps without friction. While Tesla’s value can swing on a tweet, Graphite Network is building a system where trust doesn’t fluctuate — it compounds. Learn More about Graphite Network Curve DAO Token (CRV) on the Verge of a Major Breakout Curve DAO Token (CRV) is currently trading between sixty-one and seventy-eight cents. Bulls are showing signs of weakness. The price is struggling to break through the nearest resistance of eighty-eight cents. However, with a Relative Strength Index slightly below fifty-seven, there's some room for upward motion. Bears are still in the mix, especially with a six-month drop of over forty-five percent. Short-term averages suggest a balanced viewpoint, with ten-day and hundred-day moving averages around sixty-five cents. If bulls regain strength, CRV could rise to the second resistance level of one dollar and five cents—a potential increase of over fifty percent from its lower range. Mantle (MNT) Eyes 18% Rally as Bulls Prepare to Charge Mantle (MNT) is currently trading between $0.65 and $0.73, suggesting cautious market sentiment. The bulls tried lifting Mantle but faced resistance near $0.78, while bears managed to push it towards a support line around $0.61. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at over 77 indicates Mantle is overbought, hinting at a possible pullback. A significant hurdle remains near $0.86, offering almost 18% potential growth if broken. However, the dropping trend over the past six months, with a nearly 48% decrease, signals ongoing pressure from bears. While short-term pushes might happen, steady growth needs stronger bull momentum to challenge the bears' hold. Conclusion Ultimately, the market turbulence sparked by the Trump-Musk feud does more than just damage stocks like Tesla; it sharply highlights the core value proposition of the crypto space. This environment presents a clear divergence in opportunity: on one hand, foundational projects like Graphite Network are building a new, trust-based infrastructure immune to such drama. On the other, established tokens like CRV and Mantle offer immediate, albeit volatile, trading scenarios for savvy investors. As the dust settles, it’s clear that whether one seeks to build a new financial future or capitalize on the present, the crypto market offers compelling answers to the chaos of the old guard.

This weekend, the focus shifts from Tesla's feud-related troubles to the opportunities it has created in crypto, with four specific coins showing strong potential for growth. These tokens, which demonstrated unique advantages during the political storm, have become standout options for investors. Discover which cryptocurrencies might surge ahead as this captivating saga unfolds. When Opinion Leaders Crash Value, Graphite Offers Trust That Doesn’t Wobble In a landscape where markets still react more to personality than performance, Graphite Network is building a blockchain where reputation is earned by verifiable action . It’s a bold reimagining of digital trust: structural, measurable, and immune to manipulation. Graphite Network runs on the Polymer 2.0 Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain, capable of processing 1,400 transactions per second with consistent, predictable fees. That places it firmly in competition with traditional finance systems in terms of throughput and reliability, while offering the decentralization and auditability TradFi lacks. Beyond just optimizing speed, Graphite Network is redesigning the trust layer. One Account, One Reputation: A Clean Slate for Blockchain Identity Graphite Network enforces a one-account-per-user model via a setup fee paid in $@G, its native token . This model creates a powerful deterrent to spam, simplifies counterparty due diligence, and builds a cleaner, more accountable user base. At the heart of this identity layer is the Trust Score system that evaluates users based on behavioral signals: Transaction history KYC status (optional, but rewarded) Interactions with other verified accounts For decentralized apps, this system enables risk-aware user filtering, empowering platforms and users to set their own thresholds for trust. Graphite Network Bets Big on Reputation-Led Blockchain in 2025 When volatility has again exposed the emotional core of financial markets, Graphite Network is advancing a different thesis: that trust, if structurally embedded, can outperform hype. The core of its 2025 roadmap is a push to operationalize reputation as infrastructure where Layer-2 solutions will blur the line between blockchain and behavioral credibility. Among its flagship rollouts: Phonebook Reputation MVP: A decentralized ID model linking Trust Scores to phone numbers via smart contracts. The goal is to allow users to evaluate counterparty risk in real-time using a phone number as a proxy for on-chain trustworthiness. Hotspot Bundle Initiative: A hardware-software package designed to onboard remote and underbanked populations into the Graphite ecosystem. Participants will be able to operate nodes and earn income, effectively lowering the barrier to Web3 participation. Geo Game Powered by DePIN: An educational gaming product simulating real-world macro conditions such as inflation and resource scarcity. Users will interact with on-chain economies in a controlled, gamified environment. Graphite Network brings the blockchain one step closer to real-world usability: a trusted, intuitive environment for everyone — from everyday users to enterprise builders. Learn More about Graphite Network Pyth Network (PYTH) Targets 36% Rally as Bearish Pressure Fades Source: tradingview Pyth Network's price hovers between eleven and fourteen cents, showing a slight bullish trend. With the current increase over the past week of over 4%, bulls are trying to regain control. However, the price has fallen significantly since six months ago. The nearest resistance sits at sixteen cents. If it breaks through, the next target is nineteen cents, a potential rise of around 36% from the lower end of its current range. The RSI is just above mid-point, hinting at possible upward momentum, but the mixed past performance suggests cautious optimism for further growth. Algorand (ALGO) Breakout Imminent, Poised for 50% Upswing Source: tradingview Algorand's price hovers between eighteen and twenty-two cents. Bulls and bears are equally matched, with a relative strength index near fifty-five. The current price sits at its simple moving average, hinting at indecision. Resistance at twenty-four cents blocks upward moves, while support at sixteen cents provides a safety net. If optimism returns, Algorand could see a modest rise to twenty-four cents, a gain of over ten percent. Pushing past this, the next target is twenty-eight cents, a climb of over fifty percent from current levels. However, recent performance is gloomy, with prices down over sixty percent in six months, reflecting market challenges. Celestia (TIA) Set for 30% Recovery Rally as Bulls Step In Source: tradingview Celestia (TIA) is currently hovering between two and three dollars. It shows a weak bullish presence. Recent drops of over five percent in one week and nearly seventeen percent in a month indicate bearish pressure. Despite this, there's a potential for growth if bulls regain control. The coin might aim for the first resistance near three dollars. This would mean a rise of over thirty percent from the lower end of its current range. However, with a six-month loss of more than seventy-five percent, recovery might take time. Overall, Celestia remains at the mercy of both bulls and bears looking to tip the scale. Conclusion One path is a long-term, fundamental investment in a trust-based solution like Graphite Network, designed to be immune to such drama. The other is a short-term, tactical trade on the recovery of volatile tokens like Pyth Network, Algorand, and Celestia.

Their feud over the 'Big Beautiful Bill' became an unexpected marketing campaign for Bitcoin and has stirred up significant excitement around two specific altcoins that thrived on the chaos. Curious about which digital currencies are poised for a breakout fueled by this political drama? This article unpacks the recent events and reveals key insights into the potential market movers. Bitcoin's Bullish Surge Continues with Sights Set on $121k Target Source: tradingview Bitcoin currently fluctuates between $102,410 and almost $110,000, showing strong bullish control despite some resistance. The nearest challenge for bulls lies just above $114,000. If momentum continues, Bitcoin could aim for just over $121,600, a potential growth of roughly 12% from current levels. Support remains at around $99,000, giving investors confidence in a strong base. The 10-day and 100-day averages stay close, around $105,000, indicating stability. Bitcoin's RSI suggests it's not overly bought, pointing to room for growth. The recent one-month rise of about 9% highlights potential for further gains, indicating bears are currently held at bay. Ethereum Poised for Explosive Growth, Targets $3240 Source: tradingview Ethereum's price hovers between $2410 and $2729.90, showing slight bullish strength with recent gains of nearly 39% over the past month. However, a minor dip of less than 1% this week suggests some hesitation. The bulls seem slightly weak as they need to push past the $2920 resistance to gain momentum. If Ethereum breaks this level, it could climb over 18% more to approach the $3240 mark. Support is firmly set at about $2280, offering a safety net. Current analysis shows potential for growth, but the market waits to see if bulls can overcome these hurdles and surge past existing resistances.

The key takeaway is that the chaos creates distinct opportunities: to ride the momentum of established leaders or to invest in the foundations of a more stable future.

Sui (SUI) Poised for Significant Climb as Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Sui (SUI) is trading between $3.02 and $3.71, with the bulls and bears both having moments. Its nearest resistance is just over $4, while support lingers under $3. Sui has been stable, with a slight weekly gain but a small monthly dip. Its price has dropped over the past six months. However, the current indicators suggest room for a potential climb. If Sui breaks through the $4 barrier, it might head towards close to $5, marking a potential rise of over a quarter in percentage terms. Keep an eye on the support levels to gauge any possible downward shifts.

Learn More about Graphite Network Raydium (RAY) Primed for 20% Surge from Deep Value Zone Source: tradingview Raydium (RAY) is struggling to break free from a bearish trend. The current price hovers between low twos and a little over three dollars, hinting at weak momentum. The token's value has dipped by over 11% this week and more than 12% this month, revealing bearish control. With support at around one-seventy-four and resistance at just under four dollars, bulls seem weak. Raydium needs to surpass the first barrier to catch some upward momentum. If they succeed, prices could rise by about 20% to the next resistance near four-eighty, unlocking growth potential. However, with indicators pointing to sluggish strength, uncertainty reigns for now. Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for a potential 'Big Beautiful Rebound' this weekend, it's clear the path to recovery is paved with diverse opportunities. The options range from technical plays like Sui, which shows potential for a climb, to high-risk turnarounds like Raydium, which could surge if bullish momentum returns. Contrasting these is Graphite Network, which offers less a weekend trade and more a long-term investment in a future where market value is built on verifiable trust, not personality feuds. Whether investors are looking for a short-term price surge or a long-term structural solution, this weekend's potential recovery has a contender for every portfolio.

Top 3 Coins on Our Radar,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/the-weekend-outlook-will-a-political-ceasefire-ignite-a-fire-in-the-crypto-markets-top-3-coins-on-our-radar,"As the dust settles on a week dominated by the bitter clash between Trump and Musk, the crypto market is coiled for a potentially explosive weekend. All eyes are now on a potential reconciliation, as a political ceasefire between the two titans could be the spark needed for a significant market-wide rally. With this high-stakes narrative in play, the focus now turns to the key digital assets poised for potential gains. Readers can dive deeper to uncover the top three contenders set to capture the market's attention. Stacks (STX) Primed for 50% Jump as Reversal Gains Traction Source: tradingview Stacks (STX) is currently navigating a challenging period, with its price range hovering between about seventy cents and nearly ninety cents. The coin struggles to gain momentum, with bulls appearing weak as indicated by recent drops of over twelve percent in the past week and almost twenty-seven percent in the last month. The RSI indicates a neutral zone, signaling indecision. The nearest resistance sits just under a dollar, while support is closer to the high fifties in cents. Despite a steep decline of about seventy-six percent over six months, if bulls regain strength, a climb past the dollar mark could translate to roughly a fifty percent jump from its lower current price. Graphite Network Rolls Out Reputation-Led Infrastructure to Reinvent Blockchain Trust Tesla’s nosedive after Trump–Musk row revealed a deeper flaw in how financial markets operate. Billions wiped out, not because of product failures or structural flaws, but because two powerful personalities clashed. This is what happens when trust isn’t engineered into the system. Graphite Network was built to solve exactly this kind of chaos. It does not rely on personalities, but rather it uses verifiable execution . Imagine a credit score that shows precisely what data was used, where it came from, and how it was processed. That’s the kind of transparency Graphite Network brings to every corner of its ecosystem. A Blockchain Where Trust Is the Default Setting In contrast to legacy systems where trust is patched on as an afterthought, Graphite Network bakes it in from the start: Reputation-based architecture: Your Trust Score evolves based on optional KYC (via zero-knowledge proofs), account history, and behavior. Higher trust means better experiences. Custom filters and tagged wallets: Want to interact only with verified users? Set your parameters and go. Trust becomes programmable. Zero drama, zero fraud: Transparency and accountability are coded into the network itself. Decentralized Earning For Every Node Graphite Network is both secure and inclusive. It is the first network to enable all node types to earn directly from the blockchain, opening income opportunities across the board. It’s a more sustainable and equitable future for decentralized infrastructure. Built on the Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 consensus, Graphite Network eliminates congestion, slashes energy costs, and reduces common attack vectors. Plus, it’s EVM-compatible, making it a breeze for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and dApps without friction. While Tesla’s value can swing on a tweet, Graphite Network is building a system where trust doesn’t fluctuate — it compounds. Learn More about Graphite Network Pyth Network (PYTH) Targets 36% Rally as Bearish Pressure Fades Source: tradingview Pyth Network's price hovers between eleven and fourteen cents, showing a slight bullish trend. With the current increase over the past week of over 4%, bulls are trying to regain control. However, the price has fallen significantly since six months ago. The nearest resistance sits at sixteen cents. If it breaks through, the next target is nineteen cents, a potential rise of around 36% from the lower end of its current range. The RSI is just above mid-point, hinting at possible upward momentum, but the mixed past performance suggests cautious optimism for further growth. Conclusion As the market anticipates a rally from a potential Trump-Musk ""ceasefire,"" the opportunities presented are twofold. For traders looking to ride the immediate wave, Stacks (STX) offers a high-risk turnaround play, while Pyth Network (PYTH) shows early signs of bullish momentum. For those looking beyond the weekend trade, Graphite Network provides a fundamental solution, aiming to build a future immune to the very political drama driving the speculation. Ultimately, whether you trade the spark or invest in the fireproof shelter, this weekend offers a clear strategic choice. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While Tesla crumbled under the political pressure, the crypto market demonstrated remarkable resilience, shaking off the turbulence from the high-profile feud . In this exploration, we'll look beyond the noise to reveal how this event became an advertisement for decentralization and why three specific coins are now poised for significant gains, positioned to become the potential stars of the market’s next big rally. Optimism (OP) Surges Forward with Strong Bullish Signals Source: tradingview Optimism (OP) is currently trading between fifty-six and seventy-eight cents. This shows stability with a slight bullish trend, as it edges closer to ninety-one cents, the nearest resistance. The rise of over five percent in a month indicates some positive momentum. However, with its significant drop of over seventy-six percent in six months, the path to recovery remains challenging. Optimism's price could rise by about twenty percent if it breaks past the current resistance level and reaches the next target at $1.13. Bulls show promise, but bears aren't out of the picture.

Learn More about Graphite Network Uniswap (UNI) Shows Strong Potential for 40% Rally Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) is currently trading between $5.57 and $7.37, showing a mixed picture for investors. While bulls might seem to lack strength at this moment, given the price is just under the 100-day moving average of $6.30, there's potential for growth. Confidence could boost the coin toward its next resistance at $8.44. This would mean an increase of around 40% from the lower end of its current range. A climb to the second resistance level of $10.25 could further indicate bullish momentum. Yet, the recent 28% monthly gain suggests there’s positive traction. If the momentum continues, it could mean more upward movement for Uniswap. Conclusion The crypto market's resilient comeback from the recent political feud highlights a diverse set of opportunities for investors. For those looking to trade the recovery, tokens like Optimism (OP) offer a slow-and-steady path, while Uniswap (UNI) shows stronger momentum for a potential breakout. However, the most powerful play may be investing in the ""why"" behind the comeback itself—in foundational projects like Graphite Network that build the trust and decentralization the market now craves. Whether betting on market momentum or its core principles, the path forward is paved with compelling options. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Investors are eagerly anticipating these funds, speculating that prices could skyrocket with official announcements. The coming pages will reveal the specific coins poised for significant growth, offering a unique opportunity to buy low before the market reacts. Excitement and careful timing could lead to lucrative gains. Solana's Recent Trends: Analyzing Volatility and Current Market Position Solana experienced moderate upward movement over the last month, achieving a 1.65% price increase. Over the past six months, the coin suffered a 36.85% decline, underscoring ongoing market struggles. A one-week drop of 4.19% further highlighted short-term weakness, even as pockets of recovery emerged during the recent month. Overall trends suggest that while short-term corrections may offer some optimism, the long-term trajectory remains challenging, indicating persistent bearish sentiment. Past performance reflects fluctuations between brief rallies and steep drops, shaping a cautious outlook for the near future. Solana currently trades within a range between $136 and $182.20, with key technical levels attracting market attention. Nearest resistance is at $207.90, which may hold strong if there is an upward push, while a second resistance at $253.93 represents an additional barrier for buyers. Support is observed around $115.84, with a deeper safety zone at $69.81 for potential downside protection. Technical indicators reveal a predominantly bearish tone, as the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator both indicate downward pressure. The Relative Strength Index reading of 39.58 shows market caution, as momentum appears lost despite a modest monthly gain. The price action lacks a clear trend and remains confined within established zones. Traders may consider entering long positions near support with tight stop-losses or initiating shorts when pressing against upper resistance, emphasizing the need for effective risk management in this uncertain environment. Sui Price Analysis: Key Levels and Market Behavior Overview SUI prices showed modest weekly recovery of just under 2% while suffering a 2.36% drop over the last month and a sharper 23.10% decline in the past six months. Price movement hints at a slow loss of momentum with recent fluctuations not fully reversing past declines. The coin has experienced a restrained recovery in the short term, even though its longer-term trend has been down. The figures underline a period of volatility with low gains on a weekly scale and notable weakness over extended periods. Current price levels span from roughly $2.77 to $4.01, with key support at $2.29 and second support near $1.05, while resistance appears closest at $4.77 and extends to $6.01 at a higher level. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 45.11 along with a negative Awesome Oscillator suggest subdued bullish activity and mounting bearish pressure. SUI finds itself trading in a confined range without a decisive trend. Short-term trades might benefit from a bounce off the $2.29 support, whereas a rally could face selling at the $4.77 resistance. Monitoring key levels remains essential for traders looking to exploit minor swings or potential breakouts within this range. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Levels Over the past month, Dogecoin showed a modest recovery with a 5.5% price rise despite a challenging performance over the last six months, where it experienced a steep decline of nearly 61%. The coin’s price movement has been volatile, reflecting a mix of short-term upward momentum against a longer-term downward trend. A slight rebound in the monthly performance hints at some underlying buyer interest, although the significant six-month loss highlights ongoing market struggles and overall bearish sentiment. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.1512 and $0.2470, with key support around $0.1097 and primary resistance near $0.3013. The second support at $0.0139 and a higher resistance at $0.3971 are important for trading decisions. Technical indicators, such as the RSI, suggest that sellers continue to dominate. The absence of a clear trend adds uncertainty, meaning traders might consider buying if the price holds above support levels, while a break above resistance could indicate renewed bullish action. Caution in this price range may provide opportunities for short-term trades or implementing tighter stop-loss orders. Conclusion Investing in upcoming crypto ETFs can be a smart move. Coins like SOL , SUI , and DOGE are likely to see price surges once the announcements are made. Buying them early could lead to significant gains. Keep an eye on these coins and act before the official news boosts their values. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The clash lit a fire under both of their empires. Trump’s presidency now hangs on a bill that could collapse if even three Republicans flip. Musk’s billions in government contracts are suddenly dangling over a cliff. Trump made the first move Thursday when he threatened to cancel every government contract tied to Elon’s businesses. That hit would destroy a good chunk of Elon’s portfolio. SpaceX, which works with the Pentagon, NASA, and intelligence agencies, would be gutted. It’s the main ride for astronauts to the International Space Station. It handles national security launches. NASA even gave it nearly $5 billion in crew contracts and another $4 billion to build a vehicle for moon missions. There’s also an $843 million deal for SpaceX to take down the station in 2030. Add in the $1.8 billion classified contract with the National Reconnaissance Office, and you’re looking at a network of deals worth tens of billions. And Elon wanted more. He was lining up for a shot at Trump’s missile-defense program, Golden Dome for America. That door’s closing. One official said Elon won’t be finding many allies left in Trump’s White House. After Elon trashed the president’s legislative bill this week, Republicans around Trump started floating the idea of cutting him out altogether. Trump made it official himself on Thursday. Tesla and xAI now tangled in political fire Tesla got smacked hard the same day—its market value dropped by $152.4 billion. That’s the largest one-day loss the company’s ever taken. Elon blamed the drop on the war over federal support and regulatory problems. He’s been pushing the government for changes to allow nationwide self-driving cars. Right now, individual states make those calls, and that’s been blocking his rollout plans. In April, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy visited Elon in Austin. They shot a video together from the Tesla factory. “We’re here in Austin, Texas, at the Tesla factory with Elon Musk, the great,” Sean said on X. Elon replied, “Obviously, it would be wonderful for the United States to have a national set of rules for autonomous driving.” Tesla plans to launch its first self-driving taxi service in Austin later this month. But the pressure isn’t just coming from self-driving rules. Tesla’s profits from emissions credit sales—worth hundreds of millions every quarter—are also in danger. Last month, Congress killed California’s power to set its own tailpipe emissions rules. That was one of the strongest drivers of EV investment in the U.S. If federal fuel and emissions rules also get watered down, that income dries up fast. Sales are already tanking. Tesla’s numbers in the U.S. and Europe have been falling for months. The timing lines up with Elon’s growing public closeness to Trump. Now that the alliance is dead, Tesla’s collapse may just be getting started. Trump’s entire bill now depends on a few shaky votes While Elon’s companies burn, Trump is running out of political breathing room. His mega-bill—a mix of tax cuts, border money, and slashes to Medicaid and food stamps—barely passed the House. The vote was 215–214. If just three Republicans flip, the bill goes down. And Elon’s trying to make that happen. He called the bill a “disgusting abomination” and claimed it would pile $2.5 trillion onto the national deficit. Then he went further. “Such ingratitude,” Elon posted on X, saying Trump would have lost the 2024 election without his money. Elon gave more than $250 million to Trump’s re-election effort and made it clear he’s not done spending—only this time, it could be against Trump. Rep. David Schweikert of Arizona, who missed the first vote, said Thursday that he wants “multiple changes” before he’ll support the bill. “Musk is absolutely right,” he told The Wall Street Journal, talking about the debt impact. Reps. Thomas Massie and Warren Davidson also sided with Elon and voted against it. White House aides said Elon’s attacks are backfiring. They believe his criticisms are actually pushing Republicans closer to Trump, not pulling them away. Still, Trump’s allies admit it’s getting harder to hold the line with Elon raging online to 220.5 million followers. Elon’s not stopping there. On Thursday, he polled users on X asking if they’d support a new political party. More than 3.5 million people voted. Over 81% said yes. That’s not just talk—it’s a warning. Trump’s grip on the House is already razor-thin. If Elon splits the base or funds candidates to knock out Trump loyalists, Republicans risk losing the chamber in 2026. One Republican on the House Financial Services Committee said Elon’s outbursts are “not helpful.” He also warned that the standoff could damage Elon’s long-term relationships with GOP lawmakers, especially those who used to see him as an ally.

The agency reportedly said on record that Javier didn’t break any laws when he posted about Libra on X in February, adding that the post was made in a personal capacity, didn’t involve federal resources, and didn’t violate any public ethics codes. That ruling officially ends the government’s internal investigation, though a federal court case is still ongoing and hasn’t been closed yet. The scandal started when Javier shared a message about Libra just hours after meeting the token’s founders. His post boosted the token’s visibility instantly. That same day, Libra’s price spiked, and wallets holding large amounts of the coin were dumped. The sudden crash led to massive losses for retail investors. Many accused the government of backing a pump-and-dump scam, pointing directly to Javier and his inner circle. But Javier defended himself at the time, saying, “I wasn’t trying to sell anything. I just wanted to promote a project that helps Argentine businesses.” Government shuts down Libra investigation unit after only 3 months The Libra fallout forced the Argentine government to quickly form a special task force, called the Investigative Task Force (UTI), to review the crypto drama. The unit was created by presidential decree, with signatures from both Javier and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona. Its job was to investigate whether there were any irregularities in how Libra was promoted, who profited from it, and whether any laws were broken. The UTI also had the power to request documents from public and international bodies, respond to court demands, and report any attempts to cover up evidence. But three months after its creation, the UTI was dismantled. A formal decree, signed again by Javier and Mariano, stated that the unit “has fulfilled the functions assigned to it,” with no further explanation given. That move closed the executive branch’s internal inquiry. The UTI never publicly released any findings before it was shut down. The decision came after public anger exploded, especially from crypto investors who believed the token had government backing. Some had assumed Libra was Argentina’s new official crypto project. Instead, they were left holding bags of a worthless token. Reports later revealed that only a few wallets controlled most of the Libra supply. Those wallets were emptied shortly after Javier’s post, triggering the crash and locking everyday Argentines into losses. Retail investors flooded local regulators with complaints. They demanded answers about whether someone in the government had advance knowledge and made money while the public got wrecked. The Libra controversy reached Argentina’s Congress too. In April, lawmakers formed a 28-member special investigative committee to look into the case further, but no formal proceedings have begun. Despite being summoned to appear on May 14, neither Mariano Cúneo Libarona nor Economy Minister Luis Caputo showed up. Their absence has drawn criticism from opposition politicians and some investors who say the government is dodging responsibility. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

They also want excitement, clarity, and steady movement. This trend is reshaping which projects lead the charts, some come with long-standing credibility, while others bring new presale styles that turn purchasing into an active experience. Among the top cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG leads with its gamified presale strategy, followed by well-known coins like HBAR, Litecoin, and Filecoin. Here’s why each of these coins is gaining attention, starting with the one making the biggest impact. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Gamified Presale Pushes Strong Buyer Action BlockDAG is reshaping what a presale looks like by turning the buying process into a competitive game. Through its “Buyer Battles,” people appear on a real-time leaderboard, gaining recognition for their rank. This simple tool encourages ongoing buying pressure, something many presales fail to create. Studies in human behavior show that competition and visibility can strongly motivate people. When rewards are tied to public ranking, people are more likely to act. Rather than wait for hype cycles or market rallies, BlockDAG sees daily momentum. Seeing other buyers climb the leaderboard creates pressure to act before prices change. While many presales rely on emails or influencers, BlockDAG turns its participants into promoters by giving them public visibility. So far, over $289 million has been raised, and 22.1 billion coins have been sold. The presale price remains $0.0020, promising a 2,520% return from the first-stage price. With 1.5 million X1 mining app users and fast-growing interest, BlockDAG isn’t only among the top cryptos to buy now, it’s proving how interactive models can drive serious traction. 2. Hedera (HBAR): Energy-Saving and Enterprise-Focused Hedera stands out as a low-energy alternative in blockchain tech. Using a Hashgraph model, it handles large volumes of transactions without delays or high costs. It avoids the issues that proof-of-work networks face, finalizing thousands of operations per second with very little energy. For those who want tech embraced by big names, HBAR is worth noting. With connections to Google, IBM, and LG, the backing behind Hedera is solid. Its public ledger is being used for tools in digital ID, payments, and supply chains. The reason it’s listed among top cryptos to buy now is due to this dependable support and future-proof roadmap. Even when markets dip, Hedera remains steady due to its strong partnerships and real-world value. 3. Litecoin (LTC): Dependable, Fast, and Easy to Access Litecoin is often called the digital silver of crypto, staying strong for years. While it doesn’t always make headlines, it shines with its reliable transactions and lower fees. It’s a long-standing option that serves well for direct digital transfers. LTC also benefits from being easy to find. It’s listed across most exchanges and works with nearly every wallet. This wide access makes it a good pick for those who want something established and trusted in the market. Another point in its favor is that Litecoin often moves in sync with Bitcoin during upward trends. Though it lacks flashy stories, it quietly delivers decent returns. For those considering top cryptos to buy now without needing big hype, Litecoin is a solid and stable option. 4. Filecoin (FIL): Leading the Way in Decentralized Storage Filecoin brings real purpose to the space by focusing on digital storage through a distributed network. It rewards users for lending out spare storage space, making room for a web where no central player has control over pricing or access. What gives Filecoin an edge is its focus on a problem that affects everyone: central data control. Unlike others that treat storage as a side benefit, Filecoin builds its entire system around it. FIL’s price has shifted with the broader crypto market, but its usefulness and active development keep it in play. Those who want to back real utility beyond finance will find Filecoin among the top cryptos to buy now for tech-led growth. Final Say! Looking at the top cryptos to buy now , the strongest ones don’t just ride hype. They offer clear use, ongoing activity, or new models of buyer interaction. BlockDAG leads the way with its gamified presale that turns every purchase into a contest.

On Friday, June 6, the premier cryptocurrency fell towards the $101,000 level, reflecting an uptick in the market volatility over the past few days. While the Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from this sudden downturn, there is still real concern about the market leader’s performance since reaching its record-high value. However, a new indicator suggests that the price of BTC might still have some time to run up to a new high. Analyst Predicts Four Months Of Opportunity For BTC In a recent post on the X platform, crypto expert Joao Wedson revealed that there might still be some degree of opportunity in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on a model, which was accurate in predicting past all-time high prices for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows This revelation is based on the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the tops of past Bitcoin cycles. According to Wedson’s post, this cycle top prediction model suggests that the price of BTC could still have around four months of upward growth potential — regardless of the volatility and market shakeout. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin reaches its current cycle peak whenever the Max Intersect SMA (simple moving average) hits the previous cycle top. In the 2021 cycle, the top prediction model hit the 2018 high of around $19,000 in November 2021, culminating in a then-all-time high of $69,000. Hence, when this Max Intersect SMA hits exactly $69,000 — the price top in the last cycle, that will represent the peak of this current cycle. Wedson also asserted that this model is pretty reliable, as it is backed by 200 tested algorithms. With this top prediction model still a bit off $69,000, the Bitcoin price might still be some months away from its peak. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As mentioned earlier, the price of BTC seems to be struggling after recently hitting its current all-time high above the $110,000 mark. This week’s performance must have tested investors’ patience as the flagship cryptocurrency mostly traded within a consolidation range.

As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $104,400, reflecting an over 2% price increase in the past 24 hours.

In this competitive environment, identifying the best cryptos to join for long term becomes a critical strategy. From streamlined payment systems to blockchain integrations across industries, only a few projects offer real innovation backed by scalable technology. Qubetics , with its Web3 aggregator model and cross-border settlement utility, is leading this charge by combining real-world application with scalable infrastructure. Among them, Qubetics emerges with disruptive potential as the world’s first Web3 aggregator—designed to streamline multi-chain payments and transform cross-border transactions. In parallel, two other major players—Solana and Stellar—have taken impressive strides, with new developments fortifying their presence. These blockchain giants are building ecosystems around speed, scalability, and interoperability that continue to draw global participation. Qubetics: The Blockchain Backbone for Global Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics doesn’t just ride the wave of blockchain hype—it builds the bridge that connects fragmented ecosystems. By integrating the $TICS token with real-time settlement capabilities, Qubetics has carved out a crucial use case in international finance: frictionless, near-instant cross-border payments. This application alone positions Qubetics among the best cryptos to join for long term, especially as it targets inefficiencies traditional payment rails have long ignored. Qubetics enables financial institutions, enterprises, and individuals to transfer funds securely without the latency and hidden costs that plague SWIFT and legacy systems. The platform supports banks aiming to eliminate settlement delays, multinational businesses seeking smoother cash flow operations, and even families in need of quicker remittances. The result is a cost-effective and transparent blockchain layer that addresses real financial pain points. For example, consider a logistics firm in Texas needing to settle supplier invoices in Southeast Asia. Instead of waiting 3-5 business days for bank processing, the transaction finalizes in seconds via $TICS. A remote freelancer receiving USD payments in Argentina can similarly access funds instantly without routing through multiple intermediaries. This utility—combined with the promise of scalability through the Qubetics Web3 Aggregator—makes it a standout in utility-driven crypto solutions. With adoption expanding through strategic partnerships and the upcoming Qubetics mainnet launch in Q2 2025, it’s no surprise that this project ranks high among the best cryptos to join for long term. Qubetics Final Stage Gains Attention as One of the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term With a Fixed Price Increase Ahead Now in Stage 37, the final round of its public presale, Qubetics is offering $TICS at a fixed rate of $0.3370. Having raised more than $17.7 million and distributed over 515 million tokens to 27,500+ holders, the project is gaining momentum. With only 10 million tokens left and a confirmed listing price of $0.40—offering early buyers a 20% edge—Qubetics is widely considered one of the most promising crypto presales to join in June 2025, especially for investors focused on clarity and structured tokenomics. The team has recently revised its tokenomics to improve long-term value. Total supply has been reduced from over 4 billion tokens to 1.36 billion, helping control future circulation and support value stability. In addition, the public allocation was increased to 38.55%, giving a greater share of tokens to the broader community. This model is designed to support decentralization, promote user-led participation, and maintain fairness in distribution. From an investment standpoint, a $2,000 commitment at the current price secures approximately 5,937 $TICS tokens. Once the token lists at $0.40, that holding would be valued at $2,400. If $TICS reaches $5 in a later growth cycle, the value could rise to $29,685. At a $10 price point, it would be worth $59,370. These calculations are based on current supply figures and confirmed price levels. With a capped presale phase, adjusted tokenomics, and active community support, Qubetics continues to gain recognition as one of the best cryptos to join for long term , especially for those focused on early-stage blockchain projects with clearly defined fundamentals. Solana: Reinforcing Scalability Through Institutional Expansion Solana has long been recognized for its unmatched transaction speed and ultra-low fees, and the project is advancing in meaningful ways. Through its robust architecture, Solana is integrating with enterprise-grade projects, bolstering its claim as a go-to blockchain for applications requiring high throughput. Recent integrations in gaming, DeFi, and enterprise services reflect Solana’s ongoing transition from just a fast chain to a functional ecosystem. One standout is its focus on Layer-1 efficiency to support large-scale applications like NFT platforms and decentralized social media, where speed is not a luxury but a necessity. Projects building on Solana benefit from seamless scaling and a developer-friendly environment supported by a rapidly growing community. Major tech players are exploring ways to leverage Solana’s parallel processing (via Sealevel) for real-time apps and financial platforms. Its development team remains laser-focused on reducing downtime issues that once plagued the chain—an important pivot that gives institutions and developers confidence. Solana’s broader ecosystem is also being designed to support mobile-friendly solutions and cross-platform DApps. These continuous improvements place Solana on the radar of those seeking not just hype but a deeply integrated blockchain that delivers value across verticals. Stellar: Empowering Financial Inclusion Through Decentralized Transfers Stellar was born to connect global banking systems with the unbanked. With a laser focus on remittances and micro-payments, Stellar’s network facilitates cross-border payments at a fraction of traditional costs. Unlike many chains focused on NFTs or gaming, Stellar retains its core vision: universal access to global finance. Recently, Stellar has been doubling down on partnerships with financial institutions in underserved regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These collaborations focus on increasing accessibility, reducing transfer times, and eliminating hidden fees. Stellar’s partnership model works hand-in-hand with its consensus protocol—one designed to be lightweight, fast, and reliable for financial messaging and settlement. Developers are taking advantage of Stellar’s SDKs and fiat anchors to bridge local economies with global currencies. For instance, platforms that allow users in Kenya to receive USD or EUR via mobile wallets rely on Stellar’s low-fee architecture. Stellar’s expansion into decentralized asset issuance and cross-currency swaps further enhances its value proposition. With global regulators warming up to compliant DeFi solutions, Stellar remains in the conversation for projects building the rails of next-generation finance. It continues to appeal to communities and networks that require efficient, scalable, and compliant payment rails. Conclusion: Which Blockchain Will Shape the Next Decade? Each of these platforms—Qubetics, Solana, and Stellar—brings something uniquely powerful to the table. Solana shines with its raw processing power and Layer-1 utility, appealing to developers building high-demand applications. Stellar remains a champion of financial inclusion, ensuring millions gain access to fast and low-cost cross-border payments. However, Qubetics sets itself apart with its hybrid value proposition: serving institutions, individuals, and ecosystems alike by enabling fast and secure cross-border settlements through its $TICS token. With unmatched ROI projections and a fast-moving Qubetics presale, this project is drawing serious interest from long-term community members seeking more than hype. Those seeking the best cryptos to join for long term would be wise to consider these ecosystems—especially those looking to join this best crypto presale before the next price surge.

According to the settlement administrator, the distribution of settlement payments has now begun and will continue over the next several weeks. The 2021 cyberattack compromised the personal data of a staggering 76 million US customers, exposing names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and other sensitive information. T-Mobile agreed to the settlement in July of 2022 to resolve claims from the August 2021 breach. Customers eligible for payments will receive a digital deposit or paper check based on their selection during the claim process, with amounts ranging from $25 to $100, with some eligible for up to $25,000 for substantial documented losses. The settlement also includes two years of free identity protection services for affected customers. The breach, one of the largest in U.S. history, prompted lawsuits accusing T-Mobile of failing to secure customer data. T-Mobile says it has since enhanced its cybersecurity protocols to prevent future incidents, and the company did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.

Both platforms promise unique advantages for enterprises. This article delves into the distinctive features and potential of each, exploring which project might be primed to attract the next wave of significant investments. VeChain: Steady Resistance Amidst Historic Declines Over the past month, VeChain experienced a modest dip of less than 1%, contrasting sharply with a significant decline of nearly 65% over the last six months. Price movements remained within a narrow range, with minimal week-to-week changes averaging around 0.61%. This indicates a period of limited recovery amidst ongoing weakness. Volatility was low recently, suggesting a phase of temporary consolidation. The overall trend over the six months reflects persistent bearish pressure, as past trading sessions showcased slow recovery attempts overshadowed by continued downward momentum. Currently, the price hovers between approximately $0.02 and $0.03, constrained by support around $0.015 and resistance near $0.039. A secondary resistance point resides at $0.051, with further support levels below $0.003. Indicators reflect a slight negative bias, showing a modest negative oscillator and momentum reading, while the relative strength index stands around 43, indicating neutrality. With no clear trend established, traders may explore range-bound strategies, targeting purchases near support and watching for potential breakouts past resistance. Caution is advised as technical signals suggest a prevailing bearish environment, though small gains could provide short-term recovery opportunities. Algorand Faces Decline: Short-Term Struggles Amid Long-Term Weakness Algorand experienced a moderate decline over the last month, falling by approximately 4.74%. Over six months, this decline intensified to nearly 61.86%, showcasing persistent selling pressure. Despite brief periods of relative calm, sustained weakness dominates. Attempts at rallies have faced strong resistance, indicating an ongoing struggle to reclaim previous highs. The market has shown difficulty in building upward momentum, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Algorand is currently trading within a range of $0.17 to $0.24, with resistance at $0.29 and a secondary level at $0.36. Key support sits at $0.14, while a further level is around $0.07. The Awesome Oscillator and momentum indicators highlight ongoing selling pressure. Currently, bears are in control, and price movements lack a clear upward trend. Traders should watch the $0.14 support for potential buying opportunities, while failing to overcome the $0.29 resistance might prompt short positions or a wait-and-see approach. Conclusion VET and ALGO both offer strong enterprise solutions with unique strengths. VET focuses on supply chain logistics and has partnerships with major corporations. ALGO emphasizes efficient transactions and is backed by solid academic research. Both have the potential to attract significant institutional interest. The choice between them may depend on specific business needs and existing partnerships. As the blockchain sector grows, VET and ALGO are positioned to play crucial roles in enterprise adoption.

Ruvi AI isn’t just another presale token; it’s a platform that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to tackle real-world challenges, making it a standout option for savvy investors. Here’s why Ruvi AI could be the better bet right now. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success While Solana continues to climb, Ruvi AI is blazing its own trail during its presale. With a current Phase 2 token price of $0.015 , the project has raised over $1.5 million and sold nearly 135 million tokens . Early investors who joined in Phase 1 have already enjoyed a 50% increase in value , demonstrating the strength of Ruvi AI’s growth plan. Even more enticing is the $0.07 valuation set for after the presale , a preset feature of the presale itself rather than mere speculation. Analysts also foresee a potential post-listing valuation of $1 per token , providing substantial upside. At its core, Ruvi AI is a project designed for massive scalability and long-term significance. Solana vs. Ruvi AI Solana, known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, gained traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, as an established player, its exponential growth may taper compared to emerging projects like Ruvi AI, which offer higher growth potential due to their early-stage positioning. Where Solana has carved out a strong niche, Ruvi AI breaks new ground by providing real-world solutions : Healthcare : Ruvi AI enhances diagnosis processes, improving accuracy and patient outcomes. Logistics : Through smarter supply chain tools, the platform mitigates inefficiencies, saving time and money for businesses. Finance : Secure transaction systems and advanced fraud detection make Ruvi AI a vital tool in modern financial operations. By focusing on practical applications, Ruvi AI is creating value that ensures continuous demand for its token far beyond speculative trading. Maximizing Gains With Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI sweetens the deal for investors with VIP investment tiers , offering attractive bonuses for those who get in early. Here’s how each tier works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers highlight how early investors can benefit from Ruvi AI’s structured growth strategy, amplifying gains as the project continues to mature. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Ruvi AI’s innovation in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance sets it apart from Solana and other established players. These are sectors with tremendous growth potential, ensuring Ruvi AI remains relevant and in demand as the global economy evolves. Equally important is the project’s presale timing. With tokens priced at just $0.015 , Ruvi AI presents a rare opportunity to secure significant returns before broader market awareness drives up its value. This early-stage access makes Ruvi AI a compelling offering for investors looking to maximize gains in a relatively short timeframe. Final Thoughts Solana’s anticipated climb to $250 signals strong market interest, but it’s projects like Ruvi AI that offer the real potential for life-changing returns . With tokens already up 50% for Phase 1 investors and a structured growth plan in place, Ruvi AI is a forward-thinking project combining innovation and practicality.

With SUI showing recent positive gains, the question arises: can Toncoin break through its key resistance levels next? This article delves into the potential of these coins and examines whether Toncoin can mirror SUI's upward trend, promising intriguing insights for crypto enthusiasts. Sui Price Analysis: Key Levels and Market Behavior Overview SUI prices showed modest weekly recovery of just under 2% while suffering a 2.36% drop over the last month and a sharper 23.10% decline in the past six months. Price movement hints at a slow loss of momentum with recent fluctuations not fully reversing past declines. The coin has experienced a restrained recovery in the short term, even though its longer-term trend has been down. The figures underline a period of volatility with low gains on a weekly scale and notable weakness over extended periods. Current price levels span from roughly $2.77 to $4.01, with key support at $2.29 and second support near $1.05, while resistance appears closest at $4.77 and extends to $6.01 at a higher level. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 45.11 along with a negative Awesome Oscillator suggest subdued bullish activity and mounting bearish pressure. SUI finds itself trading in a confined range without a decisive trend. Short-term trades might benefit from a bounce off the $2.29 support, whereas a rally could face selling at the $4.77 resistance. Monitoring key levels remains essential for traders looking to exploit minor swings or potential breakouts within this range. Toncoin Market Overview: Recent Gains Amid Long-Term Decline Past month TON shifts show a modest gain of 5.04% while the half-year change reflects a steep drop of 53.33%. Price action moved upward slowly over the last few weeks, with a one-week increase of 2.46% offering hints of short-term recovery. Indicators remain close to neutral, suggesting that the recent move has not yet overturned the broader negative trend seen over the past six months. The mixed performance over these periods marks a phase of volatility, where gains were limited and losses significant in the larger timeframe. Current prices trade between $2.79 and $3.61. Key levels to watch include immediate support at $2.43 and resistance near $4.06, while second levels fall at $1.61 support and $4.88 resistance. With technical indicators showing a 50.81 RSI and slightly negative momentum, the market lacks a strong clear trend. Bulls are testing limits near the $4.06 mark, but bears still influence price movements due to the recent deep drawdown. Traders might consider entering positions that respect these boundaries, watching for a break above resistance or a drop below support to better time entries and exits. Conclusion TON can potentially follow SUI 's lead, but market conditions and investor sentiment will play crucial roles. SUI's recent positive gains offer hope for similar performance from other coins. If Toncoin can break key resistance levels, it might see significant upward movement. The development and adoption of both SUI and TON will be pivotal in determining their future success. The market's reaction in the coming weeks will be essential for these coins.

During this period, the premier cryptocurrency crashed by an estimated 5% from $106,000 to trade below $101,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term volatility, several key technical indicators now point to a potentially bullish setup. In fact, this latest pullback appears to complete a series of signals that historically precede major price rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Bitcoin Set For Price Surge, First Target At $130,000 In an X post on June 6, a market expert with X username CrypFlow shares a bullish Bitcoin prediction amidst an ongoing price correction. Aside from sharp price decline in the past week, the BTC market has witnessed a steady price correction since the premier cryptocurrency achieved a new-all time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, CrypFlow states that this price retracement alongside a host of other technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is setting to repeat its price rally from Q4 2024. The first indicator observed by the analyst in the chart above is the golden cross which occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (50SMA) crosses above the 200-day simple moving average (200SMA) in early June 2025. The golden cross is a common bullish indicator that signals a shift in market momentum and was last seen in November 2024. Furthermore, there is a Bitcoin price breakout above a long-standing purple downward trendline that originated in December 2024. This breakout also mirrors another move seen in early November 2024, when BTC breached the descending resistance that began in March 2024. The ongoing price correction represents the final indicator as Bitcoin also suffered an estimated 10% price fall in November falling from $74,500 to $68,500 before initially an explosive price rally. CrypFlow’s analysis suggests that if Bitcoin is repeating its price rally from Q4 2024, the premier cryptocurrency could produce a 62% price gain translating into potential targets around $170,000. However, the analyst has set a more conservative initial price target of $130,000, representing a 25% gain from current market levels.

According to data from prediction site Coincodex, the general BTC market sentiment remains bullish despite a Fear & Greed Index of 45 which indicates Fear. The Coincodex analyst team are backing this market’s positivity with a price projection of $134,074 in five days and $155,864 in three months.

In a tweet, Ardoino shared images of shops in the country showing prices in USDT, suggesting that these could open the gates for stablecoins in the retail market. In Bolivia, real prices in shops are displayed in USD₮. A quietly revolutionary shift: digital dollars are powering daily life, commerce, and economic stability. pic.twitter.com/dGP7I2ipxv — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 7, 2025 Photos from these stores show items such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo products printed with the USDT price, not the more traditional Bolivian Boliviano. Ardoino emphasized that the stablecoin is now a part of people’s daily lives in the state. He noted that w hen digital currency is used for commerce, the relevance to the digital age is modernizing transactions, and the contextual relevance is mastering economic instability. Ardoino’s images also include popular products, including sunglasses and Milka chocolate, tagged with prices in USDT. Bolivia embraces USDT as shoppers ditch cash According to the Central Bank of Bolivia, some goods are now exclusively sold with prices set in USDT. That illustrates Bolivians’ increasing trust in digital money and the greater cryptocurrency market, including the Ethereum price. Price tags are now confusingly appearing in USDT, as the Boliviano increasingly becomes a thing of the past in regular point-of-sale transactions. This is happening as the country is also facing a myriad of economic struggles, and digital currencies have become a more stable source of value than the Nation’s fiat currency. Using Tether’s stablecoin allows customers to pay via digital wallets instead of cash, marking a new era where technology increasingly shapes payment methods. For experts, this is a major milestone. Hence, they think that the country could inspire other states to do the same. Digital payments might attract more organizations to start using them. This is especially true as platforms like Coinbase slash account freezes by 82% , signaling broader accessibility. However, this shift also highlights the requirement for coherent government policies to manage the digital currency industry. Meanwhile, many Bolivians are already accustomed to buying everyday goods in USDT. The Central Bank’s proposal to allow residents to exchange Bolivianos for Tether’s stablecoin could further simplify transactions and reduce exchange rate uncertainties. Bolivia reverses crypto ban as stablecoin adoption surges Mid last year, Bolivia’s central bank , Banco Central de Bolivia, lifted its ban on Bitcoin and crypto payments, allowing financial institutions to transact with digital assets. The ban has been in place since 2014 . In September 2024, the country reported a 100% rise in virtual asset trading , with roughly $15.6 million worth of assets traded every month between July and September. The $48.6 million traded was largely made up of stablecoins. Stablecoins are often used in developing countries whose local currency has experienced a high degree of devaluation or where there’s a shortage of foreign currency. Stablecoin use gained further momentum in Bolivia in October 2024 when local bank Banco Bisa introduced a stablecoin custody service . That service, which the country’s financial regulator supported, allows the nation’s residents to buy, sell, and trade Tether’s USDT, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Reports from September 2016 show that the state had much to gain from adopting cryptocurrencies . At that time, much of that country’s citizens were unbanked, with just 11% of residents using a debit card to make payments and only 5% using credit cards. However, the country continued upholding its ban until 2024, calling crypto a pyramid scheme in May 2017 and arresting crypto advocates.

As one of the best cryptos to buy now, ETH’s renewed strength is backed by network upgrades and growing DeFi activity, fueling bullish sentiment across the market. Meanwhile, savvy investors aren’t just focusing on blue-chip tokens, they’re also doubling down on promising a new crypto coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) under $1, seeking the next big cryptocurrency primed for explosive growth, with some projections pointing to an impressive 34x rally. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,700 members before a token price boost to $0.035 at the start of the next stage. More than $10.1 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Whether you’re tracking crypto news today or exploring what crypto to invest in, Ethereum and these emerging altcoins are dominating conversations this week. Ethereum Eyes $3,000 Amid Renewed Bullish Momentum The current price of Ethereum (ETH) is roughly $2,628.47 which is a small 0.49% rise compared to yesterday’s price. It seems ETH has escaped its early 2025 downtrend based on recent price movements, pointing to an increasing bull market. Analysts are predicting that Ethereum may rise to $2,900 by mid-June, so long as it keeps getting support and the market stays in good shape. Ethereum is favored by most investors looking for reliable cryptocurrencies, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts people interested in highly profitable crypto assets. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $10.1 million and accumulated 11,700 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 during the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. Certik-Audited With Upcoming Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a $100,000 giveaway distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Ethereum is pushing toward $3,000, driven by bullish momentum and ETF inflows. But while ETH leads the headlines, investors are quietly jumping into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new DeFi token priced at just $0.03. With over $10.1 million raised and 11,700+ holders, early buyers could see 100% ROI at launch. Backed by a dual lending model, a stablecoin, and a Certik audit, MUTM is gaining fast. For those seeking the next big crypto, ETH and MUTM are strong picks right now.

Solana (SOL) is gaining fresh momentum with analysts speculating on a $300 billion market cap. In contrast, Pi Network (PI) continues to face headwinds, struggling with technical weaknesses and unclear progress. Yet, in a space where attention moves fast, one rising project is pulling focus. That project is Unstaked, a decentralized AI platform combining utility with zero-code tools. It has already sold over 1 billion $UNSD tokens, raised more than $9 million, and kicked off a $1 million Gleam giveaway that has both speculators and builders taking notice. With no private sales and a smart launch structure, Unstaked is being positioned as one of the most bullish crypto coins of 2025. Solana (SOL) Maintains Strength as Analysts Eye a $300B Milestone Solana is showing renewed signs of long-term potential. Price action is consolidating just above a major demand zone following what analysts call a “clean liquidity sweep” on the weekly chart. This pattern, which typically signals the end of a correction and the beginning of a new upward phase, has become a key bullish indicator. The case for Solana is not just about technical setups. On-chain activity continues to climb, with growing developer adoption and a steady expansion of its dApp ecosystem. Institutional interest is rising too, thanks to Solana’s performance efficiency and high transaction throughput. Market watchers are now looking for a retest of previous cycle highs, with targets suggesting a move toward $300 per coin. If realized, that would push Solana toward a $300 billion market cap, potentially making it one of the strongest bullish crypto coins to monitor in the year ahead. Pi Network (PI) Dips Deeper as Bearish Sentiment Spreads While Solana builds upward momentum, Pi Network is showing signs of sustained market weakness. At $0.61, PI has declined steadily from its recent high of $0.66, and technical indicators continue to reflect selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 19.59, marking deep oversold territory. Meanwhile, the Williams %R sits at -94.213, and the MACD has confirmed a bearish crossover. The negative trend is not limited to the charts. Pi Network’s roadmap remains vague, and mainnet progress has been slow to materialize. Without a significant technical or market catalyst, the project appears to be losing favor among early adopters. Unless Bitcoin sees a resurgence or Pi delivers meaningful development updates, continued downside remains the base case scenario. In contrast to bullish crypto coins like Solana, Pi is lagging behind both in momentum and narrative strength. Unstaked Raises $9M and Launches $1M Giveaway as Momentum Builds While the broader market shifts between bullish and bearish sentiment, Unstaked is carving out a path of its own. Currently in Stage 19 of its crypto presale , the project has already sold more than 1 billion $UNSD tokens and raised nearly $9.1 million. At a current price of $0.011065 and a projected listing price of $0.1819, early adopters are eyeing a potential 28x return. But it’s not just about numbers. Unstaked’s protocol runs on a system called Proof of Intelligence, which allows AI agents to operate transparently and adapt through on-chain activity. The platform offers users the ability to create, deploy, and monetize these agents without writing a single line of code. With zero private allocations and fully public token access, Unstaked also presents a fair launch environment that appeals to both retail participants and community-first developers. It’s this combination of accessibility and innovation that positions it as one of the most bullish crypto coins to watch going forward. To amplify awareness and user engagement, Unstaked has rolled out a $1 million Gleam giveaway. Twenty participants will each win $50,000 worth of $UNSD tokens by completing simple tasks and purchasing at least $100 worth of tokens. This promotional campaign runs in tandem with the presale and is already drawing interest across Telegram, X, and crypto forums. The giveaway aligns closely with Unstaked’s roadmap and is being used to bring more wallets on-chain, spread awareness, and create buzz before the official launch. It’s also helping the project reach a wider audience of creators, DAOs, and builders who are looking for practical AI tools with direct application. With over 30% of the presale completed and tools scheduled for rollout shortly after launch, Unstaked is moving quickly and strategically. The project is emerging as more than a headline grabber, it’s becoming a serious contender for long-term growth. Final Thoughts: Utility, Access, and a Clear Road Ahead As we assess the crypto market landscape heading into the second half of 2025, a few key trends stand out. Solana is building strong structural support and targeting a $300 billion market cap, driven by clear fundamentals and market structure. Pi Network is facing steep challenges with weak momentum, limited development visibility, and declining investor confidence. Meanwhile, Unstaked is breaking through the noise. Its combination of AI-native tools, a decentralized and transparent distribution model, and a large-scale public giveaway is generating the kind of momentum rarely seen in presale projects. With over $9 million raised, strong product foundations, and a 28x upside baked into its pricing model, Unstaked could be the sleeper pick that defines the next market cycle.

That’s exactly what’s playing out with BlockDAG right now, just as attention starts shifting from familiar names like Cardano and SUI. Cardano is holding firm around $0.69, buoyed by institutional buzz, while SUI is showing resilience near $3.25, even after recent security concerns. But the spotlight is quickly turning to BlockDAG , especially with its $289 million raise and a major exchange rollout coming on June 13. Here’s the kicker: if you’ve already put in $200 or more, topping up by just 50% lets you double your BDAG. It’s not just a bonus, it’s a tactical play. Four uses per wallet, and once the deadline hits, the door closes. With listings across 20 exchanges just days away, this is one of the last chances to secure an outsized position before prices go public. Double BDAG, Half the Cost: Get In Before June 13! While many are buying BDAG at full price, a quieter group is locking in a far better deal. Right now, BlockDAG is running a limited-time promo that’s giving participants double the coins for just 50% more capital. Here’s how it works: if someone already bought $1,000 worth of BDAG, adding another $500 gets them $2,000 worth of coins. That’s not a typo, it’s a chance to seriously boost holdings without paying the inflated batch prices others are stuck with. This “Double Your BDAG” deal can be used up to four times per wallet, and the clock’s ticking. The offer disappears on June 13, just as BlockDAG prepares for its highly anticipated GO LIVE reveal. After that? Buyers could end up shelling out twice as much to catch up. Momentum is already building. BlockDAG has raised over $289 million, sold more than 22 billion coins, and continues gaining steam with over 1 million users mining through X-series devices. From the pocket-sized X1 app miner (earning 20 BDAG/day) to the industrial-grade X100 (pulling in 2,000 BDAG/day), the network is growing fast. More than 17,700 ASIC miners are already out there. What’s driving the surge? A mix of accessible mining tools, Ethereum compatibility, low-code smart contracts, and sustainable infrastructure. The current base price is still just $0.0018, while the current batch trades at $0.0262, already a 2,520% return. And with a listing set at $0.05, it’s clear the upside hasn’t even peaked. For those watching from the sidelines, this may be the last real chance to get in early, before everyone else catches on. Cardano Holds Firm with ETF Momentum Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground around $0.69, and there’s a lot working in its favor. Retail and institutional interest are both in play, especially with the SEC now reviewing Grayscale’s ETF proposal for ADA. Over in Japan, new exchange listings and zero-fee trading have helped turn it into a growing hub for Cardano activity. On-chain stats are strong, Cardano has crossed 110 million total transactions, and 22 billion ADA are staked, showing solid community involvement. Technically, things are picking up, too. The recent Node v10.4.1 release introduced UTXO-HD, which improves how transactions are processed. Smart contract testing is getting sharper, and early results from the upcoming Leios upgrade suggest speeds could reach 1,000 TPS. Looking ahead, ADA’s price targets sit between $0.70 and $0.90 for June, with the potential to hit $1.13 later this summer. With steady development and growing DeFi traction, Cardano could have more room to climb if it breaks through resistance. SUI Bounces Back After Cetus Exploit SUI is currently hovering around $3.25, and considering what it just went through, that’s saying a lot. After a $223 million exploit hit the Cetus DEX, the network moved fast, recovering $162 million in record time. That quick response highlighted how well validators can coordinate in a crisis, though it did spark some debate about decentralization. Even so, the price action has been surprisingly resilient. SUI bounced from $3.10 up to $3.32 after the hack and is now nudging against resistance levels at $3.41 and $3.52. If those flip, momentum could pick up again. But there’s more to the story than price. Sui’s been busy on the tech front. It launched Mysticeti to speed up consensus, added zero-knowledge logins, and introduced sponsored transactions to simplify onboarding. Developers using Move now have access to upgraded tools, including OAuth-linked wallets and delegated fee payments for added security. Looking ahead, June price forecasts range from $2.27 to $4.35. If Sui clears its resistance zones and continues improving its ecosystem, another rally might not be far off. Final Thoughts Cardano is holding steady near $0.69, backed by strong staking momentum and growing ETF chatter. SUI is bouncing back after the Cetus exploit, rolling out fresh tools and upgrades that have developers paying attention. But while both are making moves, BlockDAG is playing a different game, and it’s all about timing. Ahead of its June 13 exchange debut, BlockDAG’s “Double Your BDAG” promo is creating real buzz. Buyers who’ve already invested can add just 50% more and instantly double their total coins. It’s a strategic advantage, especially since most are still paying the current batch price. With only four chances per wallet and a hard stop before listings go live, this window won’t stay open long. Those who act now won’t just be early, they’ll be ahead. Because once BlockDAG goes public, the cost of catching up will be much higher.

However, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin will ultimately dictate the move. Keeping a close eye on the intraday chart, the expert mentioned that an early pullback could present a scalp opportunity, as long as Bitcoin aligns with the bullish outlook. Breakout Likely With Strong Daily Candles Breaking down his latest analysis, the trader explained that LINK’s daily candle officially closed bullish, marking a key technical point in the current trend. Meanwhile, LINKBTC ended the session on a positive note, which adds weight to the bullish outlook for LINK in the short term. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus However, the analyst emphasized that more bullish daily closes on LINKBTC are needed to confirm momentum. A continuation of strength could lead to an impulsive breakout above the daily candle’s lower high trendline, igniting the next leg upward. A decisive move above the 0.000140 BTC resistance zone is expected to accelerate price action for LINK, giving bulls a clear signal to push higher. If momentum continues to build, LINK could rally toward the $16 resistance level, marking a major target for the current setup. For now, $12.50 remains a key support level on the daily timeframe and will act as a cushion if bearish pressure reemerges. Looking ahead, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Dominance will remain the primary market drivers for Chainlink heading into the weekend. While maintaining a rational outlook, CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor LINK’s intraday chart closely for any developing setups. Awaiting Chainlink Next Trade Setup In conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD emphasized that LINK’s intraday chart is showing signs of a bullish recovery, closely aligned with Bitcoin’s recent rebound. He expressed optimism that further upside is likely if current conditions persist, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its strength. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent? Despite the encouraging signs, CRYPTOWZRD noted that a temporary bearish pullback would be both natural and healthy within the current market context. Pullbacks often reset market conditions, providing better structure for stronger continuation patterns. He believes such a retracement could offer a favorable early entry point for long positions, especially for short-term or intraday traders looking to capitalize on the volatility. As the market continues to evolve, CRYPTOWZRD advises traders to wait for clear confirmation of the next trade setup before taking action. His statement emphasized that strategic patience will be key in identifying the most rewarding opportunities. For now, traders should track price behavior closely and prepare to act swiftly when the next valid entry signal presents itself.

In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) faces uncertainty as it hovers near 0.16, and leverage in the market stays high. With whale activity declining and little FOMO among traders, DOGE’s short-term future looks shaky. In the middle of this, Web3 ai ($WAI) offers something different. It’s not about hype, it’s about usable AI tools. Its $WAI token is priced at just $0.000402 in Stage 7. With a listing price of $0.005242, that’s a possible return of up to 1,747%. Already, it has raised over $6.8 million, making it one of the strongest AI crypto projects heading into 2025. Cardano (ADA) Eyes Breakout at $0.48 Cardano (ADA) is trading close to $0.46 and testing a key level. If it can close above $0.48, a quick rally to $0.52 could follow. Current charts show ADA building support near $0.44, suggesting some strength is holding. Traders are watching closely to see if bullish energy pushes it over the line. Its ability to upgrade smart contracts keeps ADA on many people’s radar. But like all altcoins, its direction still depends on the broader crypto market. If the overall trend stays positive, ADA could draw more interest from traders looking for gains in both the short and long term. Dogecoin Holds $0.16 as Traders Stay Cautious Dogecoin (DOGE) is under pressure at the $0.16 level. Leverage remains high, and the price risks a drop if support breaks. While DOGE is known for its fast rallies, things feel different this time. Retail interest has slowed, and the usual FOMO seems missing. Open interest in futures is still strong, showing many traders are betting big. But if DOGE falls lower, those bets could cause a chain of liquidations. Fewer whale moves on-chain point to reduced major buys, adding to the weak mood. DOGE may still bounce, but it’s in a tight spot for now. The next move likely depends on fresh momentum or a market-wide lift. Web3 ai Gains Traction with $6.8M Raised and 1,747% ROI Setup Web3 ai is quickly rising as one of the top crypto coins by offering real tools instead of vague promises. Unlike many AI projects that only discuss future features, Web3 ai already provides working systems designed to help users in the crypto space. These include tools for tracking risk in real-time, managing trades, and setting smart alerts, all of which are powered through its native $WAI token. Currently in Stage 7 of its presale, $WAI is priced at just $0.000402. The listing price is locked at $0.005242, presenting an estimated 1,747% return for early buyers. So far, Web3 ai has raised over $6.8 million, proving strong belief in its long-term value. What sets it apart is that every function in its ecosystem depends on $WAI to operate, giving the token actual use, not just speculation. The roadmap also hints at broader ambitions. Users can expect advanced features like NFT analytics, SDK tools, and wallet integration post-listing. All updates will roll out after the token goes live on exchanges. Experts believe that with growing adoption, $WAI could aim for a $4 valuation. For those seeking utility-backed coins under one cent, Web3 ai stands out as a solid bullish crypto opportunity. Summing Up! While ADA moves with the market and DOGE fights against leverage, Web3 ai is quietly attracting serious attention. All of its features rely on $WAI. This built-in use ensures the token grows as more users join the system. ADA and DOGE mostly depend on trends or social energy. But $WAI depends on actual use. That’s a significant difference. If the platform performs well post-launch, hitting long-term price targets like $4 seems more realistic. As the market looks for top crypto coins with real value under one cent, Web3 ai’s package of working tools, smart pricing, and strong demand makes it stand out. The early access window won’t stay open forever.

In a filing , lawyers for BiT Global, an entity backed by TRON founder Justin Sun, who last year became a strategic partner to BitGo in providing the wBTC-wrapped Bitcoin token, said they had agreed to dismiss the suit with prejudice. This means the case cannot be brought again. Additionally, the two companies each said they would incur their own legal expenses in connection with the complaint Sun’s link to wBTC caused ETH DeFi protocols to stop supporting it as a collateral asset Wrapped Bitcoin tokens facilitate the use of Bitcoin on various blockchain networks. Both wBTC and cbBTC target the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the tokens do not offer any direct claim to the Bitcoin unless one trusts a central intermediary to custody the Bitcoin and release the wrapped token. Sun’s association with wBTC caused Ethereum DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Aave to contemplate disintegrating the support of the token as a collateral asset, ultimately deciding on tougher risk parameters rather than a complete exit. According to reports from credible sources, the lawsuit was filed in December 2024 by Kneupper & Covey on behalf of BiT Global, and it was claimed that if Coinbase delisted wBTC, it would be an example of anti-competitive behavior. It would also break several state and federal laws. The suit highlighted that having demonstrated the value represented by wBTC, Coinbase reversed course and removed wBTC from its platform. This made it impossible for anyone to trade it on Coinbase. The change came shortly after they launched their own similar version: cbBTC. Following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s top lawyer, stated that this important win affirms their clear right to manage security and risk for Coinbase users. Grewal added, “…we will not be bullied into continuing to list an asset that puts our customers at risk.” Previously, the exchange’s chief legal officer had defended its approach, stressing its dedication to high listing standards. He wrote on an X post that when an asset does not meet their listing standards anymore, they remove it. He further stated that they would add it to their list if another asset could meet or do better than market requirements while still following those standards. Grewal’s post faced criticism from crypto-industry insiders, including Tron founder Justin Sun, who accused the company of lacking transparency and asked how Grewal’s post squared with previous comments by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. An attached image provided by Sun depicted a screenshot of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who says Coinbase was agnostic to assets because it believes that consumers deserve options in the crypto economy. Mike Belshe defends BitGo as having a solid reputation after Sun’s backlash Earlier legal attempts to stop Coinbase from delisting the token were unsuccessful after a federal judge in December sided with Coinbase and said it had the right to delist the token. The transfer of wBTC from being managed only by the custody company BitGo to a partnership involving Sun faced backlash from people in the cryptocurrency world. In response to this criticism, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe revealed that he believes BitGo has a solid reputation because they follow the highest security standards in everything they do. Belshe concluded that Ultimately, he thinks people will see that this is not a big deal. The current market capitalization for the wBTC token is about $13.6 billion, with Coinbase’s cbBTC valued at about $4.7 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Both of these tokens are almost at an all-time high market cap.

The buzz around the top cryptos to join for 2025 opportunities intensifies as traders and enthusiasts seek projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications. Qubetics has emerged as a promising contender in this environment, capturing attention for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its potential to reshape decentralized finance. As the search for the top cryptos to join for 2025 projects heats up, established tokens like Polkadot and Stacks also demonstrate resilience and steady growth. Each of these coins plays a distinctive role in the evolving crypto ecosystem, whether through exchange token utility, supply chain transparency, or multi-chain interoperability. These dynamics are creating a fertile ground for projects that can deliver both technological innovation and practical adoption. The quest for the top cryptos to join for 2025 is more than a race for early gains; it reflects a demand for projects that solve long-standing blockchain inefficiencies while preparing for the future of digital finance. Qubetics stands at the forefront of this movement, offering solutions that address interoperability challenges, enhance security, and streamline cross-chain asset management. This makes it an essential project to watch as blockchain networks grow increasingly interconnected. Qubetics: Bridging Blockchain Interoperability and Unlocking the top cryptos to join for 2025 in 2025 Qubetics ($TICS) continues to carve a compelling niche by tackling one of blockchain’s most persistent hurdles: interoperability. Its crypto presale , currently in the 37th stage, has seen over 515 million tokens sold to upwards of 27,500 holders, raising more than $17.7 million. The token is priced at $0.3370 during this stage, providing an attractive entry point into a project built on solid technological foundations and ambitious goals. Only 10 million $TICS tokens remain in Stage 37 of the Qubetics presale, priced at $0.3370. With over 515M tokens sold and $17.7M+ raised, this is your final opportunity before a 20% price increase at launch. Qubetics has slashed its supply to 1.36B, creating rare scarcity. Act now—or miss out. Recent developments showcase Qubetics’ growing ecosystem, notably through the QubeQode platform and the Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These tools empower decentralized app developers and businesses to build cross-chain solutions with enhanced security features. Introducing a decentralized VPN further strengthens user privacy and secure communications, addressing concerns plaguing many contemporary blockchain networks. Polkadot: Connecting Blockchain Networks Through Parachain Innovation Polkadot is a leading multi-chain network that enables different blockchains to transfer messages and assets trustless. Developed by Web3 Foundation and co-founded by Ethereum co-creator Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot uses a unique relay chain mechanism to connect independent blockchains, known as parachains, allowing them to operate seamlessly within one ecosystem. This design eliminates bottlenecks and boosts scalability, making Polkadot one of the most forward-thinking Layer-0 solutions. The platform’s native token, DOT, is used for governance, staking, and bonding parachains—making it an essential component for ecosystem participation. Recent developments in the Polkadot ecosystem include accelerated adoption of parachain slots and increased community funding for decentralized applications (dApps). The network has seen a surge in developer activity, especially after the rollout of OpenGov, which offers decentralized on-chain governance to token holders. As Polkadot continues to emphasize interoperability and composability, it is increasingly viewed as a foundational layer for next-generation decentralized infrastructure. With over 550 active projects building on its ecosystem, Polkadot remains a top contender for scalable blockchain solutions in 2025. Stacks: Powering Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Web3 Utility Stacks is a unique Layer-1 blockchain that brings smart contract functionality and decentralized applications to Bitcoin without modifying the original Bitcoin protocol. By using a novel Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, Stacks anchors its security to Bitcoin’s robust network while allowing developers to build smart contracts using its Clarity language. The native token, STX, fuels transaction fees, smart contract execution, and participation in network consensus—creating a full-circle economy around Bitcoin-enabled DeFi and NFTs. The Stacks ecosystem has gained momentum recently due to increasing interest in Bitcoin Layer-2 scalability solutions and the rising demand for decentralized identity and finance on Bitcoin. With Stacks 2.1 now live and features like sBTC (a two-way pegged Bitcoin asset) under development, the platform is positioned to unlock a new era of programmable Bitcoin. This has sparked renewed enthusiasm among builders and institutions aiming to tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity with added functionality. As Bitcoin adoption grows globally, Stacks is seen as a vital bridge between Bitcoin’s store-of-value strength and modern decentralized use cases. Interoperability: Easing Blockchain Integration for All Users Interoperability remains central to Qubetics’ vision, delivering tangible benefits to businesses, professionals, and individuals alike: Businesses: Enable seamless multi-chain asset management and decentralized application integration, reducing operational complexity and costs. Professionals: Provide secure, private communication channels and collaborative environments powered by decentralized VPNs. Individuals: Grant users greater control over digital assets across different blockchain networks, fostering financial inclusivity and privacy. By simplifying interoperability, Qubetics lowers the barrier to blockchain adoption, encouraging ecosystem growth and innovative solutions that traditional finance systems struggle to match. Conclusion: Navigating the 2025 Crypto Landscape with Strategic Presale Opportunities Based on research and analysis, Qubetics, Polkadot, and Stacks represent some of the most compelling opportunities in the current market, each showcasing unique strengths that contribute to their standing among the top cryptos to join for 2025 projects in 2025. Identifying the top cryptos to join for 2025 involves looking beyond mere hype to projects delivering tangible innovation, solid partnerships, and real-world applications. With its focus on interoperability and privacy, Qubetics exemplifies the qualities that define the top cryptos to join for 2025 offerings—combining technology, adoption potential, and community engagement. Engaging with these projects at their presale stages provides early access to blockchain innovations poised to impact the future of decentralized finance and enterprise solutions. However, navigating the landscape of the top cryptos to join for 2025 options requires thorough due diligence and attention to verified developments.

It is one of the most closely monitored cases as the court decides whether selling XRP broke US securities laws. When people thought the case was finally over after Ripple and the SEC agreed to a joint settlement, District Judge Analisa Torres rejected the request because it wasn’t filed correctly under court rules. This minor setback looks like a procedural delay to some people, but others think it proves the legal system isn’t ready to handle cryptocurrency-related cases and that even the SEC is confused about applying decades-old financial laws to brand-new technologies. What happened in the Ripple vs. SEC case? The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs in December 2020 for breaking investor protection laws that apply to stocks or bonds by raising $1.3 billion from selling XRP tokens without registering them as securities. Ripple fought back, saying XRP is not a security but a digital currency, but Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that Ripple violated securities laws when it sold XRP directly to institutional investors like hedge funds and investment firms. She said the deals still involved investment contracts categorized under federal securities regulations and penalized Ripple with a $125 million fine plus restrictions on structured sales of XRP to institutions in the future. However, Ripple and the SEC reached a new agreement to reduce the penalty to $50 million and remove the restrictions in 2024, but the judge rejected their request because it wasn’t filed using the correct legal format. Why did the Judge really say no to the deal? Judge Analisa Torres rejected the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC because their legal process didn’t follow Rule 60. The rule only allows changes to final judgments if there are rare and exceptional circumstances like new evidence, fraud, or serious procedural mistakes. The judge said Ripple and the SEC just wanted to change the fine amount and remove restrictions after reaching a new agreement without a strong enough reason to meet that high legal standard. The cryptocurrency community thinks this setback shows that the current legal system is slow and rigid regarding blockchain because deals, innovations, and market reactions move in real-time. At the same time, court rulings and settlement approvals can take months or even years. This means investors will remain confused, token prices will fluctuate based on rumors, and the cryptocurrency community will speculate over future agreements in court simply because small procedural mistakes in the legal system can cause big delays. Crypto regulation still has no clear path The Ripple case is just one example of a bigger problem in how the rules for regulating cryptocurrencies remain unclear because the SEC sometimes pushes for huge penalties, and other times, it quietly drops charges with very little explanation. For example, the agency sued Kraken and Coinbase for selling investment products that weren’t registered under securities laws but recently dropped the cases after striking deals that seem to change the rules case by case. The SEC also accused Terraform Labs of damages after its TerraUSD stablecoin collapsed and wiped out billions of dollars from the market but still settled with a small penalty. These events make people wonder how enforcement decisions are really made and whether they reflect a fair or consistent set of standards when the damage caused appears far greater than in Ripple’s situation. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC still apply old rules (some written in the 1930s or 1940s) to brand blockchains, stablecoins, and smart contracts because Congress hasn’t passed any major law that gives them authority to oversee digital assets. It’s no wonder judges are unsure about what legal standards apply in these complex disputes, developers remain confused about how to build legal products, and investors don’t know what to invest in. Cryptocurrency firms strugg le to balance growth ambitions with regulatory risks Cryptocurrency companies face a dilemma where they either keep their operations small and limited to avoid attracting regulatory trouble or push for growth and innovation. However, they risk facing costly lawsuits and enforcement actions from the SEC because there aren’t clear rules. Ripple’s long and expensive legal battle shows how challenging it is for any firm to survive this uncertain regulatory environment, especially smaller startups that simply cannot afford such costly and time-consuming fights. The judge’s rejection of the Ripple and the SEC settlement was grounded in procedural laws but still felt like a missed opportunity to end a prolonged and exhausting saga because their agreement was a rare moment of cooperation that many hoped would bring clear guidance. And just like that, organizations, investors, and regulators don’t know how to move forward with innovation while staying compliant with the law. Ripple’s legal battle highlights urgent need for clear crypto regulation Ripple can still refile their motion correctly using Rule 60 (b) but will have to spend more time in court while investors remain nervous and developers cautious because XRP prices fluctuate sharply with each new headline about the case. Regulators haven’t also said when or how tokens like XRP will be officially classified and regulated under the law. This has turned the entire Ripple case into a complex, drawn-out saga that still leaves more questions than answers about the future of crypto regulation and enforcement. The watchdogs must act quickly and communicate openly to keep pace with digital finance because cryptocurrency communities urgently need clear guardrails to operate safely and know how to apply them to plan and grow without sudden legal problems.

The premier cryptocurrency, which had traded steadily within the $104,000–$106,000 range throughout the week, plunged to below $101,000 as tensions escalated between the two influential figures who attacked each other via their personally owned social media platforms i.e. X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social. Since then, Bitcoin has shown some market resilience climbing back to around $104,000. With another consolidation developing, market analyst Crypto Daan has highlighted the price levels that are critical to the next price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Beyond $106K Or Below $100K – What’s Next For Bitcoin? The month of May proved largely bullish for Bitcoin as the digital asset surged from around $95,000 to establish a new all-time high near $112,000 marking the resumption of the larger crypto bull market. However, Bitcoin has noted a significant price correction since reaching this peak with market prices pegged around $104,000 on May 31. As seen in the first week of June, Bitcoin had hovered around $106,000 before its most recent price slump on Thursday. Due to this price action, Daan Crypto notes the digital asset is now trading within a price range of $100,000-$106,000, where it comfortably sits at the mid-range around $104,000. The analyst notes that if Bitcoin returns break below the lower range boundary at $100,000, the ongoing price correction could extend for 1-2 weeks. Going by BTC’s stairwell ascent in the past month, potential market support in such a bearish case would lie around $95,000 and $85,000. On the other hand, if the market bulls can force a return above the monthly high of $106,000, Daan Crypto explains that such development would indicate the market correction is over, and Bitcoin may be headed for another price discovery with potential initial targets of around $120,000.

Using larger time frames , the premier cryptocurrency is up by 1.12% on its weekly chart and 7.49% on the monthly chart indicating a strong bullish control of the market. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart stands at 51.53 facing upward which supports the notion that Bitcoin’s correction might be over with price eyeing a return to the overbought zone above 70. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the world’s largest cryptocurrency and fifth largest asset in the world.

What’s fueling this demand? Artificial intelligence. However, it’s pretty clear the current energy grid is already stretched thin, struggling to meet electricity demands. Add anything more, and it might just buckle. More pressure on the energy infrastructure could translate into hiked power bills, brownouts, and blackouts for the American public. Worse still, if the grid can’t supply enough energy, it could bring the tech industry to a halt, potentially stifling AI development before companies can even begin to explore half of its possibilities. The US is still dealing with aged energy infrastructure in key states According to IEA’s analysis, data centers used up 415 TWh in 2024, about 1.5% of global electricity consumption, and AI servers accounted for a hefty share of that. Per their report, AI servers alone made up 24% of server electricity use and 15% of total data center energy demand last year. That’s a staggering footprint for a technology still in its early stages—and it’s only expected to grow moving forward. Alex de Vries, a researcher at VU Amsterdam and the founder of Digiconomist, believes the IEA’s figures are underestimated, calling their AI stats a bit vague. Goldman Sachs also made their projections, estimating that AI data centers could burn through 165% more power; even Arm’s CEO warned that AI might use 25% of US electricity by 2030. Sounds a bit dramatic, but the real question is, can the country handle the future energy demands of AI? The government certainly believes so, seeing that it already started issuing incentives and implementing new regulations both at the federal and state levels. For instance, in April, President Trump signed executive orders to fast-track coal energy production —supposedly to meet the AI industry’s soaring power demands because reviving fossil fuels in 2025 is the answer. Well, analysts aren’t exactly thrilled with the president’s decision. Many doubt it’ll even be enough, and environmentalist backlash is only getting worse. Focusing on fossil fuels like natural gas or coal could alleviate the AI power crisis, but building new fossil fuel-powered facilities may take at least three to five years. If we are talking nuclear plants, it could take even longer, roughly seven to 15 years. Furthermore, renewables like solar and wind require costly battery storage to maintain steady power for AI data centers. Not to mention, multiple transmission lines and substations in several states are over 50 years old. Talk about ancient; some even date back to the 19th century, particularly in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago, which begs the question, is there really a method to cater to AI power demands, or should companies rethink their tech development strategies? CEO Michael Polsky asks the government to provide support to power developers. The US is still very focused on beating China in developing artificial intelligence. However, if it stands a chance to win, it would need to invest in power superhighways to move large quantities of electricity, according to Invenergy LLC Chief Executive Officer Michael Polsky. He argues that establishing a national transmission activity to set up high-voltage lines could even expedite the process. His words: “I do believe it’s an emergency because of how difficult it is to build things. We don’t have decades to figure this out. We have years.” Additionally, he suggested the government offer support to power developers as it does for others like Musk and his spaceships. He claimed they should also be fairly compensated for their investments. However, the Trump administration seems hell-bent on budget cuts, especially on clean energy power developers. Just last month, the government cut off nearly $4 billion in support from some clean energy projects. Not to mention, Invenergy’s Grain Belt Express project funding could be next on the chopping block, meaning it could potentially lose about $11 billion that could transmit 5 gigawatts of power across 800 miles. Nonetheless, Invenergy President Jim Murphy believes the government will still fund their project. Polsky even argued that their project was of national concern.",OP-ED|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-08 03:30:41

But while most projects stick to claims, BlockDAG is focused on delivery. Instead of relying on flashy buzzwords, it’s putting tools in users’ hands and building real traction. With more than $289 million raised, 22 billion BDAG distributed, and a growing user base of over 1.5 million on its X1 app, BlockDAG is shifting from concept to functioning platform. Its success is rooted in a blend of familiar crypto foundations and user-first tools. So what makes BlockDAG (BDAG) more than just another Layer 1? And why does its mobile-first model matter so much for future blockchain adoption? A Different Kind of Chain Built for Performance BlockDAG’s name reflects its design. Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on a single chain of blocks, it uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. That means it can handle many blocks at the same time, instead of one by one. This approach offers a clear speed advantage. With parallel processing and no bottlenecks, BlockDAG supports fast transaction speeds and low latency. And it doesn’t trade off security, thanks to its Proof-of-Work mechanism. It’s also compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so developers can bring over existing Ethereum dApps without major changes. It’s not trying to replace Ethereum, but rather offer a faster, more flexible space to build or expand. X1 App Makes Mobile Mining Simple and Popular While the tech side draws in developers, BlockDAG’s X1 app is what’s attracting everyday users. It’s available for both Android and iOS and lets people mine BDAG from their phones, no fancy hardware, no steep learning curve. You just tap the app once a day to start earning, with a maximum of 20 BDAG daily. It runs on a Proof-of-Engagement model, which rewards participation rather than processing power. That keeps it light, energy-efficient, and accessible to everyone. Features like a referral system and global leaderboard make it fun and competitive. These social elements have helped the app grow rapidly, turning it into a go-to entry point for people new to crypto. But X1 is not stopping at mining. It’s evolving into a full Web3 hub, with upcoming tools for NFT minting, smart contract testing, and BDAG transfers, all inside the same app. That shift toward a complete mobile crypto toolkit is key. In areas where phones are more common than computers, a mobile-ready platform lowers the barrier to entry and opens the door to widespread use. Community Growth Driven by Real Engagement Beyond its tech and usability, BlockDAG’s momentum comes from its community. Its presale has become one of the most successful in crypto, already raising more than $289 million over 45 stages. A big part of that success is Buyer Battles, a campaign where the top buyer of the day gets the remaining BDAG from that day’s allocation, up to 150 million. So far, these daily wins have added up to $1.26 million in bonus BDAG. This approach beats traditional marketing. By giving users real rewards, BlockDAG turns early supporters into active participants who help grow the project organically. For builders, BlockDAG has launched a Developer Hub that includes tools like a Smart Contract Wizard, an IDE, and Testnet access. These tools are already live, so teams can start building without waiting. The Primordial Testnet is up and running, giving developers a place to test dApps, run contracts, and fine-tune performance. As more features roll out, teams will be able to simulate mainnet conditions and scale with confidence. This mix of users, miners, and developers working together is what makes BlockDAG’s larger vision real, a shared platform where growth isn’t limited to one group. Closing Thoughts BlockDAG isn’t chasing headlines, it’s focused on progress. While other projects talk big, BlockDAG is actually launching tools, attracting users, and building an ecosystem that works. With $289 million raised, 1.5 million users on the X1 app, and developer tools already live, it’s clear this isn’t just hype. It’s user-driven growth backed by real technology. Whether it’s the simplicity of mining on a phone or the flexibility of its EVM-compatible architecture, BlockDAG is moving forward with a clear goal, to bring more people into crypto without making it complicated.

Bitcoin traded at $105,000, while Ethereum’s price moved to $2,500. This article looks at some of the top trending coins like Ravencoin, AB, and Keeta. Ravencoin price analysis Ravencoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency created as a hard fork of Bitcoin. Its main difference with Bitcoin is that it has a supply cap of 21 billion, while Bitcoin has 21 million. RVN price surged recently after Upbit, the biggest South Korean exchange, listed it, giving it access to millions of customers. It moved to a high of $0.0257, the highest point since December last year, and then pulled back to $0.01570. Ravencoin price remains slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01428, the highest swing on May 13. It has also jumped above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a sign that bulls remain in control. Ravencoin price chart Ravencoin token also remains above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the MACD is pointing upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the 38.2% retracement point at $0.01912. A drop below the support at $0.0142 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Read more: Ravencoin (RVN) is pumping? Is it about Litecoin ETF speculation? AB price forecast AB is a blockchain project that offers a modular technology that supports fast and secure transactions, smart contract execution, and decentralized governance. The AB token price has jumped recently following its listing on several exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and MEXC. It has also done well as on-chain data shows that its network is starting to gow, albeit from a low base. AB has handled over 1.5 million blocks since inception and 29,792 transactions. It is handling about 2.6k transactions a day, while addresses have risen to 23,6111. However, its network utilization remains at 0.01%, meaning that it needs to supercharge its growth to justify its valuation. The daily chart shows that the AB price bottomed at $0.004084 on May 26 and then bounced back to $0.01040. It has moved slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01. The highest point on May 28. AB token price chart The Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, technicals suggest that the AB token will continue rising as bulls target $0.015. However, AB is a thinly traded token, meaning that it may have extreme moves on some days. Keeta price forecast Keeta is a blockchain network that delivers over 10 million transactions per second. Its goal is to unify the blockchain industry by enabling users to move assets across multiple chains. It also lets users to create tokens that represent real-world assets. The two-hour chart shows that the Keeta token price has done well in the past few days as it moved to a record high of $1.4920, up 262% from its lowest point this year. Keeta token recently moved above the key resistance level at $1.2400, its highest point on June 3. Moving above that level invalidated the double-top pattern that was forming. Keeta price chart It has also retested that level, pointing to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $2. A drop below the support at $1.2400 will invalidate the bullish Keeta price forecast.

The tweet was accompanied by a table outlining six critical differences between the two systems, focusing on technology, settlement methods, transaction speed, cost, use of intermediaries, and regulatory environment. Technology: Centralization Versus Decentralization The chart shared by XRP Update highlights a fundamental difference in the underlying architecture of SWIFT and XRP. SWIFT is described as a centralized messaging system, responsible for facilitating interbank communication rather than moving actual funds. It depends on the cooperation of multiple financial institutions across jurisdictions, creating a dependency on centralized governance and infrastructure. In contrast, XRP operates on a decentralized blockchain protocol, where transactions can be verified, validated, and settled across a distributed network. XRP Update points to decentralization as a key advantage. Decentralized systems are less vulnerable to single points of failure, more transparent in operation, and can process transactions without needing complex institutional approval chains. The post implies that XRP’s architecture is more aligned with modern demands for open, secure, and globally accessible financial systems. KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN $XRP & #SWIFT $XRP IS THE BEST OPTION pic.twitter.com/pnGIEvyhGF — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) June 6, 2025 Settlement and Speed: Instant Finality Versus Delays Another major distinction outlined in the post involves the settlement process. SWIFT facilitates a sequential settlement model through correspondent banks, which often introduces multiple layers of coordination, time delays, and operational risk. These settlements can take anywhere from one to five days to complete, depending on the jurisdictions and intermediaries involved. XRP Update emphasizes that XRP offers direct and instant settlement. The blockchain processes transactions within seconds and offers immediate finality without passing through various institutions. This ability to settle in real-time is a direct response to the inefficiencies of legacy systems. It addresses major concerns in cross-border payments, such as liquidity management and reconciliation delays. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cost and Intermediaries: Reducing Fees and Friction XRP Update also points to cost as a major differentiating factor. SWIFT’s dependency on a network of correspondent banks naturally introduces additional fees, including processing charges, FX spreads, and administrative costs. These expenses are typically passed on to consumers or business users, making cross-border transfers significantly more expensive than domestic ones. XRP’s system, as highlighted in the tweet, is designed to eliminate most of these intermediaries. By eliminating the need for correspondent banks, XRP not only reduces the time required to transfer money internationally but also the associated costs. The tweet suggests this leads to a more affordable and efficient global payment experience, especially for financial institutions and fintech companies seeking to optimize cross-border operations. Legacy Acceptance Versus Modern Challenges The final point in the comparison table addresses regulatory status. SWIFT benefits from well-established regulatory recognition, having operated within the traditional financial system for decades. XRP, on the other hand, continues to face regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States. XRP Update acknowledges this difference but does not portray it as a disadvantage that outweighs the benefits. Instead, the post implicitly argues that regulatory uncertainty is temporary and that XRP’s technical advantages will eventually drive broader acceptance. Despite ongoing regulatory hurdles, the tweet positions XRP as not only a viable but optimal choice for the future of cross-border payments. With growing institutional interest in blockchain solutions, XRP’s technical attributes continue to gain relevance, especially in a financial system increasingly defined by speed, efficiency, and global interoperability.

Here’s Why Qubetics Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now,https://thecoinrise.com/still-holding-btc-or-bnb-heres-why-qubetics-might-be-the-best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now/,"Blockchain just took another leap forward. The latest ETH L2 updates are slashing gas fees, and institutions are quietly increasing exposure to digital assets. Meanwhile, newer protocols are drawing in massive TVLs, showing that innovation is sprinting ahead. With the world edging closer to digital-first finance, traditional assets like stocks and bonds aren’t holding the same charm they once did. Instead, crypto projects with strong fundamentals and active communities are emerging as the preferred alternative for everyday buyers. And speaking of strong contenders, Qubetics is gaining serious traction. Positioned at the front of the new digital frontier, Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, fusing tools and services that power decentralized living. In a world that’s more digitally dependent than ever, this project doesn’t just ride the crypto wave—it builds the next one. Let’s compare Qubetics with the OGs: Bitcoin and BNB, and see which is the best cheap crypto to buy now. How Qubetics’ dVPN Could Be the Breakthrough Web3 Needs Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional VPNs, offering censorship resistance, enhanced privacy, and user-driven infrastructure. However, despite their promise, most dVPN solutions today face critical challenges. These include poor user experience, limited network reach, low speeds due to fragmented node quality, and high technical barriers for both node operators and users. Many projects also suffer from weak economic incentives, making it difficult to maintain active, reliable nodes at scale. For the average user, setting up or navigating a dVPN can still feel overly complex and unreliable—limiting real-world adoption. Qubetics addresses these limitations by integrating dVPN functionality into its broader Web3 framework, enabling faster, more reliable, and user-friendly decentralized private networking. Its ecosystem is designed for seamless access—where users can connect to privacy-first routing infrastructure without managing complex setups or relying on underperforming node networks. Qubetics uses a token-based model that rewards node operators fairly while ensuring network stability and scalability. It also supports cross-chain integration and real-time performance validation, allowing users to connect securely across regions and protocols with confidence. For developers and enterprises, Qubetics offers SDK-level access to embed dVPN features directly into decentralized applications, making privacy not just an option, but a default layer within Web3 architecture. Final Presale Stage: From $0.01 to $0.3370—Last Chance Before Listing Qubetics began its presale journey at just $0.01 in Stage 1. Now in Stage 37, the final crypto presale stage, the token is priced at $0.3370, having raised over $17.7 million, distributed 515 million tokens, and attracted 27,500+ holders. Once this final allocation is sold out, $TICS will list publicly at $0.40, offering an immediate return of 18.71% to those buying in now. At the current rate, a $5,000 investment secures approximately 14,837 tokens. If the token reaches $1 post-launch, the value grows to $14,837. At $5, it climbs to $74,185. If it hits $10 or $15, the valuation jumps to $148,370 and $222,555 respectively. With the token supply reduced to 1.36 billion and 38.55% reserved for public distribution, Qubetics offers a rare mix of scarcity, utility, and early-mover advantage. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price—after that, the public market takes over. Bitcoin (BTC): The Unshakable Digital Reserve It’s the original, the heavyweight, the symbol of decentralized money. Still, it has earned its title as digital gold. It’s held by thousands of major buyers, corporate treasuries, and individual wallets worldwide, and it’s got the battle scars to prove it. Bitcoin’s value isn’t just in price. It’s in its network security, its first-mover advantage, and its unmatched decentralization. When markets shake, many still rush to Bitcoin. It’s a mainstay in the digital asset space, but for those scouting for the best cheap crypto to buy now, BTC might be more of a long-term stronghold than a near-term multiplier. The days of 1,000 percent gains might be in the rearview, but for those who want stability in a sea of volatility, Bitcoin continues to be the go-to. BNB (Binance Coin): The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem BNB started as a utility token and grew into the glue holding the Binance ecosystem together. Whether it’s paying fees on Binance Smart Chain, participating in launches, or powering DeFi and NFT platforms, BNB is everywhere. BNB’s community is huge, with millions of users relying on it for day-to-day transactions across DeFi apps, staking protocols, and token swaps. That kind of use gives BNB real-world weight. It isn’t just speculative—it’s integral to daily blockchain use. But for new backers hunting the best cheap crypto to buy now, BNB may feel a bit pricey compared to tokens like $TICS, especially if the goal is catching early-stage growth. Still, its track record is solid. BNB exploded from a few dollars to hundreds in just a few years, proving that exchange-based tokens can become major players in the space. And with Binance constantly evolving, BNB remains a dependable bet for those looking for something with both utility and staying power. Why Qubetics Is Grabbing All the Spotlight Right Now The ongoing crypto presale of Qubetics has created a ripple effect in crypto circles for a reason. It’s not just about the potential gains. It’s about relevance. This project hits where modern issues lie—privacy, decentralization, access, and usability.

Think about all the different services out there: VPNs, DeFi wallets, staking platforms, DEXs, aggregators, identity verification. Qubetics brings them under one roof with actual use cases. You’re not just holding a token—you’re part of a platform that does real work in the real world. That’s why it’s being seen as the best cheap crypto to buy now by early adopters who understand where tech is headed. Whether you’re someone who’s sick of handing your data over to centralized services or a professional needing secure, borderless communication, Qubetics delivers. And with each presale stage pushing the price up, those watching from the sidelines are starting to feel the heat. Once this thing hits exchanges, the whole vibe could shift fast. Final Thoughts: Ready or Not, Qubetics Is Coming 2025 isn’t the year to play it safe with tired assets. Between rising inflation and a digital-first future knocking at the door, there’s a growing call for assets that are nimble, tech-forward, and built for where the world is going, not where it’s been. Bitcoin holds the crown for being the pioneer. BNB has cemented its spot in the daily use category. But Qubetics? It’s making a serious case for being the best cheap crypto to buy now , especially for those tuned into real utility and tangible future gains. With massive presale momentum, promising ROI projections, and a platform tackling real-world problems, it’s not just a project—it’s a movement.

The evidence presented supports the argument that scalability, cost-efficiency, and regulatory compatibility are critical for any digital asset to be integrated into institutional-grade financial systems. On all of these fronts, XRP significantly outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. Scalability Bottlenecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum Scalability, in the context of global payments, refers to the system’s ability to handle millions of transactions simultaneously with speed, reliability, and minimal cost. According to data cited in the images attached to the tweet, both Bitcoin and Ethereum process fewer than 20 transactions per second. This is a major constraint considering that modern banking infrastructure must scale to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. As noted by IBM’s Lund, while newer systems are achieving up to 4,000 transactions per second in experimental setups, legacy blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain severely limited by their foundational architecture. WHY BTC AND ETH WILL NEVER COMPETE WITH XRP IN GLOBAL PAYMENTS Scalability means how well a system can handle lots of transactions at the same time, quickly and without high costs. Banks need this because they process millions of payments every day that must be fast and… https://t.co/N5tjg8GZ64 pic.twitter.com/PnuiSqLZc1 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 Regulatory and Operational Incompatibility The high volatility and low scalability of BTC and ETH are further highlighted in academic literature. A 2022 publication available on Springer concludes that these assets are unsuitable as payment instruments in most distributed ledger technology (DLT) use cases due to these very limitations. Their underlying proof-of-work consensus mechanisms not only limit throughput but also make transaction confirmation times longer and energy consumption unsustainable. These technical deficiencies also create complications for compliance within regulated financial environments, further disqualifying BTC and ETH from institutional adoption in global payment systems. XRP’s Technical Design for Institutional Use In contrast, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is cited in a separate academic paper on the EDISON-X energy trading system as an example of a DLT built for fast, low-cost, and scalable payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRPL uses a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism, which enables transaction finality in 3–4 seconds, with a cost of less than $0.001 per transaction and the capacity to handle up to 1,500 transactions per second. These attributes make XRP suitable not only for peer-to-peer payments but also for enterprise-level applications such as energy trading and cross-border financial settlement. Institutional Preferences and Real-World Integration Furthermore, the scalability and low transaction latency of XRPL are central to its adoption by financial institutions. As highlighted in a Financial Times excerpt shared in the tweet, Ripple engineered its technology from the outset to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. This design goal aligns with the operational requirements of major financial institutions such as Standard Chartered and Bank of America, which necessitate systems that can support large-scale, real-time transaction processing. SMQKE’s tweet argues that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not built for today’s payment environment, and available data supports this claim. XRP, on the other hand, was designed specifically for fast and reliable transactions within regulated frameworks. This distinction explains why banks and regulated financial entities have steered clear of BTC and ETH in operational payment infrastructure, reserving their usage for speculative purposes instead. In summary, technical scalability, regulatory alignment, and settlement efficiency are essential for digital assets to be used in global payments. XRP, through its consensus mechanism and system design, meets the scalability and compliance standards required for institutional adoption, making it a strong candidate for modern payment systems.

Instead, it presents itself as a structured and scalable framework for what it describes as “interconnected, decentralized, and compassionate healthcare.” The company is advancing this vision by expanding physical and digital infrastructure in tandem, asserting that each milestone — whether a new clinic, app feature, or wallet update — enhances the overall functionality and purpose of its ecosystem. Ground-Level Impact Through Strategic M&A in Uganda One of the company’s key strategies involves mergers and acquisitions in Uganda, which serve to establish and strengthen healthcare service delivery on the ground. These physical assets form a critical base for its broader, tech-enabled health system. According to the Medium article, the company’s proprietary XRPH AI App offers multilingual, personalized health guidance, providing users with context-sensitive support in real time. XRP Healthcare positions this tool as a step toward greater individual empowerment within the healthcare journey. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Integrating Digital Tools for User-Centered Health Access In addition to the AI-driven application, the XRPH Wallet acts as a digital interface for secure interaction and payments. It is a part of the infrastructure designed to facilitate smoother patient-provider exchanges and improve healthcare access through decentralized technology. Another feature, the Prescription Savings Card, is exclusively accessible through the XRPH AI App. This card links users to a network of over 68,000 pharmacies in the United States, offering potential financial relief and increased affordability for prescription medications. Upcoming TSX Venture Listing and Global Investment Outlook The company also referenced its forthcoming listing on the TSX Venture Exchange . This move is described as an effort to open its platform to global investors and allow public capital to support what it characterizes as a long-term vision for health equity and prosperity. XRP Healthcare stated that it represents a new class of health company, one that merges financial performance with societal benefit through responsible acquisition strategies, AI-driven tools, and decentralized finance. By pairing traditional business models with emerging technologies, XRP Healthcare continues to position itself as an active agent in reshaping healthcare delivery and accessibility.

Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While momentum has cooled, the broader structure remains intact. The price action is showing signs of potential accumulation at support, and traders are watching closely to see if this pullback turns into a deeper correction or a fresh leg up. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC is currently holding above the $103K region after sweeping the $101K sell-side liquidity. The previous bullish structure is still valid, and the price is likely targeting the mid-range of the ascending channel. The 100-day (orange) and 200-day (blue) moving averages are not far below, sitting at $92K and $95K, respectively, and continue to slope upward. This indicates that the long-term bullish momentum is not yet broken. The RSI on the daily is recovering slightly from below 50, suggesting neutral momentum after days of cooling off. Until the asset breaks below the $100K–$101K range, the current drop looks like a healthy correction in an uptrend. However, failure to reclaim the $106K–$108K resistance area quickly could increase the probability of revisiting the $95K–$97K order block, and even the two moving averages. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, BTC wicked below the descending wedge pattern after finding strong demand near the $100K area and began a V-shaped recovery. This structure historically signals a bullish reversal, and the move back above $103K supports this case. However, the current rally is approaching resistance again, which is the higher boundary of the pattern near the $105K mark, and the RSI is still under 50. This level could act as a temporary ceiling unless momentum strengthens. The sharp wick below $100K looks like a textbook liquidity grab, suggesting market makers ran stops before driving the price higher. If the buyers manage to hold above the $100K base and flip the $105K–$106K area, the door reopens for a push toward $108K and possibly a new all-time high above $112K. On the other hand, a failure to do so would likely lead to more range-bound action between $101K and $106K in the coming days. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve The Exchange Reserve chart reveals a persistent and steep decline in the amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges, now reaching a historic low at 2.3 million BTC. This trend has accelerated over the past year and continues into June 2025, despite BTC trading above $100K. In classical supply-demand terms, this represents a significant supply-side squeeze: fewer coins on exchanges mean less liquidity available for instant sale, tightening the circulating supply and amplifying the impact of even moderate demand spikes. This behaviour reflects a strong macroeconomic undercurrent. First, institutional accumulation is likely driving much of this trend. Large entities often move coins off exchanges into custody solutions when positioning for long-term holding or to reduce counterparty risk. Second, the growing presence of spot Bitcoin ETFs and custodial platforms (like Fidelity or BlackRock) means that BTC is increasingly flowing into vehicles that don’t recycle it back onto exchanges, removing it from the liquid supply indefinitely. This dynamic creates structural illiquidity that underpins Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside.

Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin’s Journey: Is the Original Cryptocurrency Still King? Bitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first cryptocurrency. It operates without a central authority, allowing people to send money directly to each other. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin uses a shared ledger called blockchain. This ledger is spread across many computers, so no single entity controls it. Transactions are verified by miners, who solve complex puzzles to add new records and are rewarded with bitcoins. This process keeps the system secure and prevents fraud. In today’s market, Bitcoin remains a major player among cryptocurrencies. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and events called “halvings,” which reduce miners’ rewards every four years, affect its value and mining. Compared to other coins, Bitcoin is seen as digital gold—a store of value. Recent trends show renewed interest in Bitcoin as people look for alternatives to traditional money. While other cryptocurrencies offer different features, Bitcoin’s established network and early start make it attractive to many. Ethereum’s Leap into the Future: Scalability and Growth Await Ethereum has been a pioneer in the blockchain world since its launch in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, or dApps. With the move to Proof-of-Stake through the Merge in 2022, Ethereum reduced its energy consumption and opened new possibilities for efficiency. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon help speed up transactions and lower costs. The upcoming sharding phase aims to make the network even more scalable and affordable. Ether (ETH), the network’s native token, remains central, used for transactions, rewarding stakers, and as a tradable asset. In the current market cycle, Ethereum’s advancements make it a significant player to watch. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, its shift to Proof-of-Stake and focus on scalability set it apart. Predictions based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles estimate that ETH’s price could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, the yearly low is estimated at $2,700.31, with further growth expected up to 2030. These trends suggest that Ethereum may have considerable potential in the years ahead, especially as it continues to innovate and strengthen its network. Solana’s SOL Coin: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Technology Solana is making waves in the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second without slowing down. This is great news for developers who want to build decentralized apps, known as dapps. Solana supports multiple programming languages, making it easier for more people to create on its platform. At the core of Solana is its native cryptocurrency, SOL. This coin powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who help keep the network running smoothly. Many see bright potential in SOL. Its technology allows it to support a high-capacity network, which is ideal for services that need to handle a lot of users at once. In today’s market, where fast and efficient blockchain solutions are in demand, SOL stands out. Compared to other coins, it offers quicker transaction times and lower fees. With the growing interest in areas like decentralized finance and NFTs, Solana’s capabilities make it a strong contender. For investors and developers looking for the next big thing in crypto, SOL could be an attractive option. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Currency Shaking Up the Crypto World Have you heard of XRP? It’s a digital currency that’s making waves. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was designed to be fast, cheap, and accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional money, it doesn’t rely on banks or central authorities. Transactions are quick, secure, and can’t be reversed. With an initial supply of 100 billion, most of which was given to Ripple (formerly OpenCoin Inc.), XRP aims to make transferring money as easy as sending a text. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and low costs. While some cryptocurrencies struggle with slow transfers and high fees, XRP offers a sleek alternative. It allows smooth payments across different currencies, making it valuable in our global economy. Ripple’s efforts to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem could enhance XRP’s potential even more. Compared to other coins, XRP’s focus on real-world use makes it an attractive option. As the crypto world evolves, currencies like XRP that solve practical problems might lead the way. Conclusion BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP are strong options, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher with its sports-meme blend, targeting 20,000% growth and engaging a passionate community.

This marks one of the most significant efforts to incorporate XRP into corporate treasury strategies. The reported figures, while still proposed and subject to execution, reflect a substantial level of interest in XRP as a treasury reserve asset across diverse sectors. Webus International Files to Deploy $300 Million in XRP Webus International has filed documentation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating its intention to establish a $300 million XRP treasury reserve . The company, which operates in the global payments sector, has expressed interest in leveraging XRP to support cross-border payment solutions and improve financial infrastructure. According to Webus’ public statements, the allocation would be integrated into its broader strategy to enhance liquidity and payment efficiency. VivoPower Raises Capital for XRP Treasury Backed by Saudi Investor VivoPower, a sustainable energy company listed on Nasdaq, has raised $121 million to fund its XRP treasury strategy. This capital came through the sale of 20 million ordinary shares at $6.05 per share. Saudi royal Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud reportedly led the fundraising round The company intends to establish an XRP-based treasury reserve as part of a broader effort to become a pioneer in digital asset treasury adoption within the clean energy industry. With operations in solar power, electric vehicles, and battery technology, VivoPower’s strategic move toward XRP is positioned as part of its long-term innovation strategy. Executives have stated that the firm views digital assets as complementary to its sustainability mission and financial optimization goals. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Wellgistics Plans $50 Million XRP Reserve for Payment Integration Wellgistics, a U.S.-based pharmaceutical distribution company, announced a proposed XRP treasury of $50 million . The firm has secured an equity line of credit to finance the initiative. According to earlier disclosures, Wellgistics intends to use XRP not only as a reserve asset but also as a payment rail within its operational network, which spans over 6,000 pharmacies. The company’s objective includes enabling real-time payments and improving cost efficiency in the healthcare supply chain. If implemented, this would represent one of the earliest efforts to integrate a digital asset into payment operations in the pharmaceutical sector at this scale. Growing Interest in XRP Across Industries The proposed XRP treasury allocations suggest a growing institutional interest in the asset beyond its historical use in remittances and on-demand liquidity. An X user known as ChainStories reacted to the report, commenting , “Looks like more companies are hopping on the XRP train. Interesting to see how this strategy pans out for them.” The remark reflects an emerging trend where corporations across finance, energy, and healthcare are examining the utility of XRP in treasury and payments infrastructure. With a combined proposed allocation of $471 million, these moves—if finalized—would constitute one of the largest public commitments to XRP by corporate entities. The long-term effectiveness of these strategies will likely depend on execution, regulatory clarity, and market stability. However, the initiatives mark a noteworthy moment in the broader institutional exploration of blockchain-based treasury management.

Industry insiders and top analysts are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising new altcoin trading well below $1 but showing strong fundamentals and viral momentum. MUTM’s support comes from more than 11,700 investors who have contributed $10.1 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see their investment doubled to $0.06 when the token is launched in exchanges. As the hunt intensifies for the best crypto to buy now, MUTM stands out as a high-potential candidate, poised to deliver remarkable returns where others, including ADA, may face slower growth. For investors wondering what crypto to invest in, this emerging DeFi token could be the smartest bet before its anticipated surge. Mutuum Finance into Phase 5 of its Presale The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.1 million total sales and attracted more than 11,700 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders can depend on regular income, while borrowers find safe options when they borrow money. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Resilient USD-Pegged Stablecoin Following Certik Audit Completion Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. While Cardano (ADA) has long been a go-to for steady growth, attention is now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto with real potential to hit $1 and beyond. With over 11,700 investors already backing the project and more than $10.1 million raised in its presale, MUTM is currently priced at just $0.03—meaning early buyers could see their investment double when the token launches at $0.06. What sets Mutuum Finance apart is its innovative dual lending system that gives users more control and flexibility, combined with a stable, USD-pegged coin that’s been fully audited for security. For those wondering where to invest next, MUTM offers a promising mix of strong fundamentals and growth potential that many established coins can’t match right now. Getting in early could be a smart move before this project takes off.

Recent price action shows increasing bearish momentum. Buyers have failed to hold critical levels on both the USDT and BTC pairs, suggesting a cautious outlook for the short term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair XRP/USDT is now trading around $2.2 after getting rejected from the higher boundary of the large descending channel. The price has also lost the 100-day MA (orange) and is testing the 200-day MA (blue), both located around the $2.30 mark. The RSI also sits near 44, reflecting weak bullish momentum and a lack of buying interest. A daily close below the psychological level at $2 would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward the $1.55 demand zone, which also aligns with the lower trendline of the channel. Until the buyers reclaim the moving averages with strong volume, the trend favours the sellers. Structurally, the market remains neutral to bearish, with a potential shift toward bearish if the current consolidation fails to reverse. Investors should watch for a reaction around the $1.90–$2 area, which will likely dictate the next directional impulse. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair is trading around the 2,100 SAT mark after a prolonged grind lower within a descending wedge structure. Once again, the price has lost both the 100-day and 200-day MAs, which have also created a bearish crossover around the 2,500 SAT mark, and is now hovering above the lower channel boundary and the 2,000 SAT demand zone. There is also a notable FVG (Fair Value Gap) in the 1,600 – 1,900 SAT range, which may act as a magnet and a support zone in case the 2,000 SAT level breaks down. Buyers will need to reclaim the moving averages and break above the channel’s higher trendline around the 2,500–2,700 SAT zone to regain any strength, which currently seems unlikely unless Bitcoin itself consolidates. As long as the price remains within the channel, short-term relief bounces are possible, but momentum still favours sellers. The broader implication is continued BTC strength or XRP relative weakness in the market cycle.

The ETF is highly concentrated, with top holdings like MicroStrategy and Coinbase heavily influencing performance and adding company-specific risk. BITQ is volatile, directionally correlates with bitcoin, and has a higher expense ratio than direct bitcoin ETFs, making it less attractive for pure bitcoin exposure. Given these factors, I recommend a HOLD rating on BITQ, suggesting investors consider direct bitcoin funds for simpler, lower-risk exposure. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is an equity ETF designed to provide investors with exposure to the equity of companies involved in bitcoin. Before investing in this strategy, one must be aware of the additional layer of risks involved in holding a portfolio of companies involved in the bitcoin market. If one is seeking direct exposure to bitcoin, it may be worth considering one of the bitcoin funds as opposed to an equity strategy. BITQ holds roughly 30 individual equities of companies that span from bitcoin miners to banks and asset managers. Overall, the basis for the strategy is to hold a portfolio of ""picks and shovels"" companies building out the core infrastructure for bitcoin, including miners and brokerages. Interestingly enough, Strategy ( MSTR ), formerly known as MicroStrategy, is the portfolio's top holding despite having minimal involvement in the development of the bitcoin ecosystem. Nonetheless, Strategy is a large holder of bitcoin through a leveraged debt & equity issuance strategy for acquiring bitcoin. The target balance for the strategy is to allocate a minimum of 80% of the portfolio to Tier 1 crypto innovator companies whose primary focus is in the crypto market with the remaining 20% in Tier 2, large-cap companies with diversified business interests that include ""one significant public business line focused on the crypto market."" Accordingly, for a company to be classified as a Tier 1 company, 75% of their revenue must derive from servicing cryptocurrency markets. This includes crypto mining firms, crypto mining equipment suppliers, crypto financial services companies, and other financial institutions servicing primarily crypto-related clientele. Companies can also be classified as Tier 1 organizations if 75% of net assets are direct holdings of bitcoin, Ethereum, or other related cryptocurrencies, resulting in Strategy being classified as a Tier 1 Crypto Innovator. Corporate Reports With BITQ holding 30 companies, company concentration will be greater than when compared to larger, more diverse portfolio strategies. Accordingly, the top 10 holdings account for 60.35% of the total portfolio weight. This may mean that the direction of the portfolio strategy can be determined primarily by the top 10 holdings, which include bitcoin miners and a brokerage platform. Corporate Reports Strategy is by far the most heavily weighted company in the strategy, accounting for 11.97% of the portfolio. Though my most recent research covering MSTR is quite dated , I believe the overview can be helpful in assessing the company. MSTR has a unique investment proposition in which the organization issues debt and equity to buy bitcoin in a flywheel fashion. The organization sells this strategy as a leveraged bitcoin fund. The other side of the business consists of legacy operations relating to its business intelligence platform, which many investors in MSTR downplay as the organization transforms into a bitcoin strategy. Given the weight of MSTR in the portfolio, I recommend potential investors research this company prior to making an investment decision in BITQ. The second-largest holding in BITQ is Coinbase Global ( COIN ), a cryptocurrency brokerage platform, at 9.45% of the portfolio weighting. Many of the names following are mining organizations, with MARA Holdings ( MARA ) being by far the largest miner in the cohort. Though my research covering MARA is also dated, I believe understanding the company's structure can help investors determine whether BITQ is an appropriate investment strategy. In short, MARA is a cryptocurrency mining company that began diversifying its business strategy last year into data center infrastructure, including submerged server cooling units. Though the mining industry is power-intensive, the strategy has shifted in the last few years from strictly mining to offloading heat generated from the servers as a form of energy production. Overall, the industry is relatively volatile, with profitability remaining relatively challenged. Given the volatile nature of bitcoin and reporting requirements, financial analysis of the industry can be relatively challenging and may not appropriately represent the industry. FinChat Additionally, given the volatility of bitcoin, fund performance can drastically vary from period to period, showing large gains or losses at any given time. Corporate Reports Year-to-date, BITQ has outperformed the S&P 500 ( SPX ) despite the drastically larger drawdown. TradingView As a result of the volatility in the bitcoin and related market, this strategy may be best suited for active traders or those willing to undertake major short-term risks. In general, BITQ is directionally correlated with the underlying bitcoin market. Under this notion, investing in BITQ may add an additional layer of operational risk when compared to a direct investment in bitcoin. Given that the equities in the portfolio are businesses and not a commodity, one must consider the business operations in addition to bitcoin performance as an associated risk. This may also include industry risk, political risk, and financial performance. TradingView BITQ has an expense ratio of 80bps, making BITQ relatively more expensive than comparable strategies. Given the relative correlation between related equity ETFs and bitcoin ETFs, it may be worth considering investing in bitcoin ETFs given the relative performance, lower fees, and comparable performance. Seeking Alpha My recommendation is to take into consideration the broader risk profile of the portfolio companies that make up BITQ. If seeking bitcoin exposure, it may be wise to consider one of the bitcoin funds over the equity ETFs, as many of the business-related risks aren't prevalent. I am recommending BITQ with a HOLD rating.",BITQ,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-08 07:35:10
45672501,https://cryptonews.com/?p=369193,1749368518,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45672501.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Golden Cross Pattern Targets $150,000 Rally",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-golden-cross-pattern-targets-150000-rally/,"Bitcoin is once again flashing a historically bullish signal, a golden cross, as traders eye the $150,000 mark. Currently trading at $105,597 with a daily volume of over $35 billion, BTC has pulled back slightly after its latest golden cross. This setup occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average, typically viewed as the start of a long-term uptrend. Chain Mind, a widely followed crypto analyst, notes that this pullback isn’t unusual. In fact, it mirrors what happened in late 2024. Back then, Bitcoin dropped 10% right after the golden cross , only to surge over 60% in the following two months. The recent 8% decline post-cross appears to be following the same script. 3/➫ Back in Q4 2024, $BTC dropped 10% right after the golden cross ❍ Then it reversed hard and rallied over 60% in two months ❍ That pattern is repeating now – $BTC has already dropped 8% post-cross ❍ The similarities are striking — 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗜𝗡 𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗗 (@0xChainMind) June 5, 2025 He emphasizes patience. While many expect immediate gains from a golden cross, history suggests the pattern often begins with a dip before a broader rally unfolds. According to Chain Mind, the setup remains intact, and the $150,000 target by year-end remains realistic. Bitcoin Holds Key Support Zone What reinforces the bullish bias is Bitcoin’s ability to stay well above its 200-day moving average, which now sits near $94,700. This level acts as critical long-term support. As long as BTC holds above it, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview Chain Mind also highlights a rise in Bitcoin dominance, which has hit a three-year high. Investors are rotating capital out of altcoins and back into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer store of value amid broader market uncertainty. Consider these signs of strength: Bitcoin’s dominance is rising, while altcoins are losing ground. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to hold above $2,500. Altcoins like SOL and ADA have broken key support levels. Long-term holders continue to sit on their BTC instead of selling. This points to sustained institutional interest. Firms like Metaplanet and Strategy have been buying large amounts of Bitcoin, while spot ETFs continue to see inflows, despite price volatility. Institutions Favor Bitcoin, Not Altcoins One of the clearest signs that Bitcoin remains in favor is the behavior of large investors, also known as “whales.” On-chain data shows a significant portion of Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in months, reinforcing the idea that long-term holders aren’t shaken. Altcoins, on the other hand, are under pressure. Many are not just lagging BTC, they’re also falling against the U.S. dollar. Chain Mind points out that until sentiment improves and key percentages, such as ETH/BTC or SOL/BTC, begin trending higher, Bitcoin will continue to dominate. To sum it up: The golden cross pattern is historically bullish, even in the face of short-term dips. BTC holding above $94,700 supports the uptrend. Rising dominance and institutional inflows point to a potential surge. For traders and investors alike, this is a classic case of “zooming out.” The short-term noise may rattle nerves, but structurally, the setup for a powerful Bitcoin rally toward $150,000 appears intact. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Hits $552K—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is taking off as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2, combining speed, scalability, and meme culture.

According to the core devs, they want a hands-off approach to how the Bitcoin network is used, a proposal that has not gone down well with everyone in the community. The proposal is coming amid the ongoing controversy concerning non-monetary use cases. “This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the statement published on the Bitcoin Core website said. In the letter, the developers argued that the Bitcoin network is defined by its users, who are free to choose what software they use and implement the policies they want. The post also highlighted that its core contributors are not in a position to mandate what software or policies they desire. This statement comes amid the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network. “Being free to run any software is the network’s primary safeguard against coercion,” the developers added. Bitcoin community divided after developers’ statement The statement seemed to have gone down well with many Bitcoiners, and like with every update, some people were against it. One of its critics was JAN3 CEO Samson Mow , who had issues with the tone of the letter. “Bitcoin Core devs have been changing the network gradually to enable spam and now seem focused on also removing barriers for spammers. It’s disingenuous to just say “It is what it is now, too bad.” This statement itself is also inappropriate. Feels like an NYA from Core devs,” he said. A statement on Bitcoin Core development and transaction relay policy – https://t.co/K4AaPPqTSD — Bitcoin Core Project (@bitcoincoreorg) June 7, 2025 Mow’s statement comes after a May 8 update in which the core developers decided to remove a long-standing limit on transaction data in a network upgrade to allow for larger data segments. “Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” the announcement read on GitHub. Like with this update, some Bitcoiners still saw an opening to non-financial use cases. Meanwhile, Casa founder Jameson Lopp defended the letter. Lopp mentioned that the core developers are saying that they don’t want to force anyone to run a code they don’t want, highlighting what they think about relay policy and network health. “When there was no cohesive message, and it was just a bunch of independent developers making individual statements, Bitcoin Core was accused of having “poor public relations,” Lopp said. He also added that now that the group has published a joint statement, people are finding a reason to be offended about it. Developers make their case in the joint letter According to the developers, it is better for the BTC node software “to aim to have a realistic idea of what will end up in the next block, rather than attempting to intervene between consenting transaction creators and miners to discourage activity that is largely harmless at a technical level.” They also added that while this view is not shared by all users and developers, they believe that it is in the best interest of Bitcoin and its users, hoping that they agree with their statement. The developers mentioned that the main goals of transaction relay are predicting what Bitcoin transactions will be mined, speeding up block propagation” for the transactions expected to be mined, and helping BTC miners learn about fee-paying transactions. Meanwhile, Bitcoiner Carl Honton has criticized the bill saying, “It’s Bit “Coin” not Bit “Bucket” or Bit “Store” or whatever general purpose data store you have in mind. It’s a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr also criticized what the group aimed to achieve with the relay policy outlined in the statement. “The goals of transaction relay listed are basically all wrong,” Dashjr said. He added that predicting what will be mined is a centralizing goal. Expecting spam to be mined is defeatism. Helping spam propagate is harmful.

Trading at $2.18 as of June 7—up 1.5% in the last 24 hours—XRP’s short-term trajectory remains a focus for investors seeking clarity amid ongoing market volatility. XRP Maintains Resilience Amid Political Turbulence The escalating public feud between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has unsettled the broader cryptocurrency market. The dispute erupted when Musk criticized Trump’s proposed tax and spending bill, which triggered a series of retaliatory public exchanges. The tension intensified further after Musk alleged that Jeffrey Epstein’s case files were being hidden from the public because they implicate Trump. This conflict has introduced a fresh layer of uncertainty into the markets, influencing sentiment and risk appetite across digital assets, including XRP. Yet, XRP has shown notable resilience despite this environment. According to a recent projection from ChatGPT, XRP is expected to climb approximately 5.5% to $2.30 by June 30, 2025. ChatGPT stated, “Given the strengthening fundamentals behind XRP, combined with its current momentum and resilience in the face of broader market disruptions, our projection anticipates a modest rise to $2.30 by the end of this month.” Ripple’s Strategic DeFi Vision Drives Optimism Supporting this forecast are strategic moves that continue to bolster XRP’s ecosystem. Ripple recently announced a partnership with BDACS , a South Korean digital asset custodian. This move is aimed at expanding institutional-grade custody capabilities. The initiative reflects Ripple’s ongoing efforts to position XRP as a foundational asset in enterprise-level blockchain applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple has also introduced a robust roadmap designed to support decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. Central to this strategy is the integration of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) under the XLS-30 standard, which are expected to enhance liquidity across tokenized assets on the XRP Ledger. These upgrades not only modernize the infrastructure but also offer improved trading mechanisms for institutional participants. Commenting further on XRP’s development trajectory, ChatGPT added, “The XRP Ledger’s evolving infrastructure—particularly the integration of AMMs and its strategic DeFi ambitions—makes XRP one of the few large-cap assets with a clear institutional use case. These innovations, while not immediately priced in, are setting the foundation for sustained growth.” While political tensions may continue to stir short-term price fluctuations, XRP’s core fundamentals and Ripple’s roadmap are steering the asset toward a more stable and utility-focused future. ChatGPT’s projection of a modest rise to $2.30 by June 30 reflects both market confidence and an acknowledgment of XRP’s long-term potential.

The Pi Network's native token, the Pi Coin, has garnered attention as analysts and investors speculate on its potential to reach $1 by 2025, amid a market that is increasingly competitive with new entrants like Codename:Pepe. The Position of Pi Network in the Cryptocurrency Landscape As new cryptocurrencies emerge, established projects like the Pi Network must continuously innovate to maintain investor interest. Pi Coin, in particular, has shown resilience but faces challenges that could hinder its growth. The coin's price fluctuations reflect a mixture of optimism and cautious skepticism from the market. Recently, Pi Network's token has observed notable volatility, with its price moving between $0.57 and $0.76. Analysis of the coin's past performance over different periods shows a 13.15% decrease over the last week but a 10.26% increase over the past month. This fluctuating trend underscores the uncertainty and the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets: With support levels at $0.49 and resistance at $0.88, Pi Coin's future movements will likely depend on broader market trends and its ability to break through these barriers. Emerging Challengers: Codename:Pepe's Market Entry Amid the evolving crypto landscape, Codename:Pepe emerges as a formidable challenger, combining AI-driven technologies with the popular appeal of meme coins. This innovative project aims to capitalize on both trending aspects of the crypto market to carve out its niche. The integration of AI into its framework allows Codename:Pepe to offer unique features such as identifying emerging meme coins, analyzing market sentiment, and optimizing trading strategies. This positions it well in a market that values both technological advancement and community-driven projects. Additionally, Codename:Pepe engages a community-centric approach to its presale events, providing early investors with attractive pricing tiers. Presale Opportunities and Investor Appeal The strategic presale model adopted by Codename:Pepe has been designed to attract early investors with significant incentives, presenting a multi-stage structure where early participants benefit from the lowest prices. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase and Join the Codename:Pepe Community Comparative Analysis and Final Thoughts While Pi Coin continues to navigate the uncertainties of the cryptocurrency market, its performance compared to new entrants like Codename:Pepe will be crucial.

The suit had sought over $1 billion in damages, claiming the delisting favored Coinbase’s cbBTC token. Coinbase reported mixed Q1 earnings, with revenue up but net income down 94%. Coinbase and BiT Global have reached a settlement in their legal dispute over the delisting of BiT Global’s wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) token from the exchange. According to a joint court filing , BiT Global has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice, preventing future legal action on the matter. Both parties will cover their own legal costs. Details of any further settlement terms were not disclosed. BiT Global Sued Coinbase Over wBTC Delisting in California Court BiT Global filed the suit last year in the Northern District of California, after Coinbase removed wBTC from its platform. The exchange cited “unacceptable risk” that the token could be controlled by Chinese-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who became affiliated with wBTC through a partnership in August 2023. Coinbase raised concerns after Sun’s involvement, questioning BiT Global about his role in the token’s operations. Meanwhile, Sun-backed World Liberty Financial switched its cbBTC holdings in favor of wBTC following his appointment as an advisor. BiT Global argued the delisting was unjustified and damaged both liquidity and market confidence in wBTC, while allegedly giving an edge to Coinbase’s rival product, cbBTC, launched two months prior to the delisting.

The lawsuit sought more than $1 billion in damages and requested injunctive relief to prevent further harm. However, with the dismissal finalized, the legal chapter between the two firms is now closed. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs. Coinbase’s earnings were weighed down by unpredictable macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in digital asset prices. However, the company noted its second-highest ever monthly user count, with CFO Alesia Haas highlighting increased engagement across non-trading services.

Perhaps the most notable reason behind this odd increase is a recent update by the US securities watchdog, which involved XRP and other altcoins. Polymarket Odds Through the Roof As perma-XRP bull John Squire informed recently, the chances for approval of a Ripple ETF by the end of the year had skyrocketed to 98%. Recall that the odds had dropped below 70% just a few weeks prior and recovered to 80% before the surge. As of press time, the percentage has dropped to 88%, which is still a lot higher than the year’s average. When it comes down to a July 31 deadline, though, the odds are down to 17% and continue to get lower as the date approaches, and there are no big developments on the matter aside from SEC application delays . $XRP ETF confidence soars to 98% The market isn’t guessing anymore, it’s anticipating. Liquidity, legitimacy, and momentum are lining up. This is no longer “if”… it’s when. pic.twitter.com/Bi4Z88kLpD — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 7, 2025 The reason why odds on Polymarket are so important for future developments is the platform’s success rate. As reported earlier this year, its accuracy levels have been quite impressive, at around 90%. Here’s Why the Odds Surged Such an impressive pump in the approval odds from around 80% to almost 100% in a single day couldn’t be just a coincidence. In fact, it came after the SEC approved a NASDAQ crypto US settlement price index, which includes XRP, as well as other altcoins like ADA, SOL, and XLM. According to crypto experts, this development is particularly important as it signals that these assets have solid liquidity and reliable pricing, and it removes key obstacles for spot ETF approvals.

Cryptocurrency lost 1% of its value. GRT coin prices target the next support at $0.0893. On June 8, 2025, the Graph price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The altcoin value has corrected below $0.0910 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the currency shed 1% of its value in the day. Despite the upside yesterday, today the market events remained unfavorable for the bulls. The Graph 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of The Graph confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has dropped to $0.0910 over the last 24 hours. In addition, the higher volatility levels suggest a higher chance of reversal. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to heightened volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.1220. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.0827. GRT/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator confirms the recent downturn in price. Its value has decreased to index 40.31 in the day. However, this still suggests that buyers have room for a reversal. If the bearish momentum continues to grow, further instability in the market can be expected. The Graph 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of The Graph coin referred to a weaker bullish trend in the market. Buyers are now aiming for an increase above the current level on the GRT/USD price chart but have not succeeded yet. The Bollinger Bands are converging, resulting in decreasing volatility. This decrease in volatility signifies a lower market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.0954, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.0874, securing the support. GRT/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI indicator is moving sideways within the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has slipped to index 43.33 in the last four hours. The straightening curve on the RSI graph represents a bearish pressure in the market.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives out a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.0910 in the past 24 hours. A continuation of the current bearish rally might trap the GRT price within a bearish zone. However, the increasing volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a high chance of a trend reversal, which, if it happens, can lead to a price improvement above $0.0920. Why is GRT down? The decrease in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past few days supported the bulls, as the buying momentum remained substantially high, so the coin is correcting today. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, GRT should rise above $0.5 in 2029. In that year, the price will range between $0.490 and $0.547. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

Since most altcoins are quite sluggish on a daily scale, we will examine in more detail their weekly performances, where TAO and CRO stand in one corner, while HYPE, LEO, ICP, and TRX are in the other. BTC Above $105K The world’s largest cryptocurrency tried to break out at the beginning of the business week from its consolidation range but was stopped at $106,000 and $106,500 on Monday and Tuesday. The following rejections drove it south to the lower boundary, but the bulls went on the offensive once again on Thursday. However, bitcoin was stopped once again at $106,000, but this time, the correction was a lot more violent. Perhaps influenced by the ongoing spat between US President Trump and Tesla CEO Musk, BTC’s price tumbled hard and went to a multi-week low of $100,400 (on Bitstamp). As it came close to a breakdown below the coveted $100,000 level, the situation reversed and bitcoin started to recover some ground. By Friday noon, it had rebounded to around $105,000. Slightly more volatility followed, but BTC was ultimately stopped at $106,000 yesterday and now trades around $500 lower. Its market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Up and Down The weekly scale shows that HYPE has emerged as the top gainer, having surged by almost 9%. As a result, the high-flyer now sits above $35, just less than $5 away from its recent peak. ICP follows suit with an 8% weekly increase, while LEO, TRX, and AAVE are next. On the opposite scale are TAO (-11%), GT (-5.3%), and CRO (-5.2%). SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and SHIB are also about to close the weekly candle in the red. The total crypto market cap has added around $30 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.410 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

BiT Global has “definitively” dropped its lawsuit filed in the Northern District Court of California, meaning it cannot be refiled. Under the agreement, each side will cover its own legal fees. BiT Global claimed in a lawsuit filed last year that Coinbase had unjustifiably delisted wBTC, damaging the token’s liquidity and reputation. The company claimed that Coinbase aimed to highlight its own competing product, cbBTC, with this decision. Related News: Yet Another Hack Attack: Significant Losses Reported for These Altcoins Coinbase defended its decision to delist, stating that the token posed an “unacceptable risk” and that it was concerned that “it could end up in Justin Sun’s hands.” Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire Justin Sun became associated with wBTC through his partnership with BiT Global in August of last year. Following this development, Coinbase began to question Sun’s role in the project. Interestingly, after Sun joined the project as an advisor, World Liberty Financial abandoned cbBTC and resumed supporting wBTC. However, the lawsuit did not provide any additional details about the content of the agreement. The parties only agreed that they would cover their own legal costs. *This is not investment advice.

The FCA had banned ETNs in January 2021 , citing their volatility and complexity for retail investors. However, because we’re seeing increasing warmth towards cryptocurrency across the globe, the UK doesn’t want to be left behind. Keep reading to find out more about the UK’s decision regarding ETNs, how the US also has major pro-crypto legislation in the works, and what the best crypto to buy now is in light of these developments. UK & UK Embrace Crypto For those unaware, an ETN is a debt security instrument offered by recognized entities. Its value is tied to an underlying asset, which, in the case of crypto, is a specific coin. As the price of the underlying asset goes up, the price of the ETN will also increase, and vice versa. It’s worth noting that crypto ownership in the UK has increased from 18% in 2024 to 24% in 2025 . This is more than that of the US. Naturally, a growth like this calls for a comprehensive regulatory design to regulate the ownership and use of digital assets in the country. Meanwhile, in the US, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is expected to go for a floor vote soon enough. The GENIUS Act aims to regulate various aspects of stablecoins, such as permitted issuers, transparency, consumer protection, federal and state-level oversight authority, and legal classification. All in all, a friendlier regulatory environment will lead to a more thriving crypto market. Bitcoin recently made an all-time high of $112K , and with positive and proactive legislative support, it might soon hit $150K, too. To hop on the crypto train and make the most of its momentum, consider investing in the following altcoins. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Best Crypto to Buy Now, the Fastest and Most Affordable Trading Bot Increased crypto adoption will directly impact the growth of meme coins, which is already among the most profitable niches of the crypto space. As a result, Snorter Token could see massive growth in the coming weeks. It’s a Telegram-native trading bot designed to snipe (buy) the best meme coins as soon as they’re launched using a contact address or pool ID. This way, it will help you outsmart the bots and whales circling like sharks in the crypto market. Snorter Bot is mighty secure, too. It’s got honeypot and rugpull detection, mint trap detection, real-time blacklist scans, and freeze alerts. Other useful features include copy-trading tools, portfolio tracking, and the lowest trading fees (just 0.85%) of all competitors if you hold $SNORT. You can become an early investor in this awesome meme coin with real utility by buying into its presale. The Snorter Token presale is fairly new but has still managed to raise over $575K. Each token is currently priced at just $0.0947. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will help you directly benefit from Bitcoin’s upcoming bull run, but at a fraction of the cost. It’ll do so in two ways: First, you’ll profit from a substantial increase in $BTCBULL’s price. According to our predictions, BTC Bull Token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 – a 3.7x jump from its current price of $0.00255. Second, you’ll benefit from BTC Bull Token’s free Bitcoin airdrops. A striking feature, the aforementioned $BTC airdrops will take place when Bitcoin reaches $150K and $200K for the very first time. However, only those who hold their $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events on social media will be eligible for free $BTC. Even better for $BTCBULL owners, the project will regularly shave off a part of the token supply. This will increase the crypto’s demand, which would then, in all likelihood, crank up its price. Buy BTC Bull Token now for just $0.00255 each. The project has emerged as one of the best crypto presales , with nearly $7M in early investor funding. 3. KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) – Viral New Meme Coin with Massive Potential KoKoK The Roach ($KOKOK) is a new meme coin that launched towards the end of May but has risen to become a force to reckon with in the entire crypto space. $KOKOK is up over 310% since its inception , including a chunky 28% gain over just the past seven days. This fascinating ‘disgusting’ meme coin is proof that degens have enough love to share with other animals, too, besides cute dogs, cats, and frogs. ‘The King of the Drain Pipes’ might be a fitting description for $KOKOK, but the fact remains that it could soon surge past its all-time high of around $0.20 and become one of the greatest meme coins of this year. It’s currently trading at $0.1724, with a market capitalization of $35M and a trading volume of $1.13M (up 110% over the past 24 hours). Increasing Crypto Adoption Notwithstanding, DYOR Is Necessary Despite the market’s increasing bullish outlook on the back of pro-crypto regulatory reforms, there’s no guaranteeing any returns on specific coins.

Growing regulatory clarity in the EU and US is accelerating institutional interest in stablecoins. Deutsche Bank has expanded its crypto capabilities through partnerships. Deutsche Bank is stepping deeper into the digital assets space, as Europe’s largest lender explores stablecoins and tokenized deposit solutions to modernize payments. The bank is weighing whether to issue its own stablecoin or participate in a broader industry initiative, Sabih Behzad, Deutsche Bank’s head of digital assets and currencies transformation, said in an interview with Bloomberg . It is also assessing the potential for developing tokenized deposits that could streamline transaction settlements. Stablecoins Gain Traction as Alternative Payment Method Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies such as the euro or dollar, along with tokenized deposits — blockchain-based representations of traditional bank deposits — are gaining traction as banks explore faster, cheaper payment methods. While such technologies have been under development for years, tangible large-scale use cases remain limited. “We can certainly see the momentum of stablecoins along with a regulatory supportive environment, especially in the US,” Behzad noted. “Banks have a wide variety of options available — everything from acting as a reserve manager to issuing their own stablecoin, either alone or in a consortium.” Regulatory clarity is helping to accelerate interest. With EU-wide frameworks in place and stablecoin legislation moving through the US Congress, banks are increasingly confident about entering the sector. Deutsche Bank is examining stablecoins and tokenized deposits, considering options such as issuing its own token or joining an industrywide initiative. https://t.co/QkJe9NRAX4 pic.twitter.com/R9cb2TVbuF — ICO Drops (@ICODrops) June 7, 2025 Deutsche Bank is not alone. Spanish lender Banco Santander recently began early-stage work on a stablecoin and plans to offer crypto services through its digital banking arm. Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm DWS Group, together with Flow Traders and Galaxy Digital, has also launched a joint venture to issue a euro-denominated token. “I do see a role for a European stablecoin, or European banks working on a stablecoin, especially for settlement purposes in a digital world,” ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said this week. In parallel, JPMorgan’s Kinexys network — which supports blockchain-based payments — now processes more than $2 billion daily, though that still represents a small slice of JPMorgan’s $10 trillion in daily payment flows. Deutsche Bank Deepens Push into Crypto Deutsche Bank has been gradually building its digital assets capabilities. Last year, it invested in Partior , a blockchain-based cross-border payments platform. It also partnered with Swiss blockchain firm Taurus in 2023 to offer digital asset custody services to institutional clients. Additionally, the bank is participating in Project Agorá, an initiative led by the Bank for International Settlements and several central banks aimed at exploring tokenization’s role in wholesale cross-border payments. As reported, Citigroup has projected a dramatic rise in the stablecoin market, forecasting that its total market capitalization could soar from nearly $240 billion today to over $2 trillion by 2030 . The prediction says the growth in adoption would be driven by regulatory developments and increased interest from both financial institutions and the public sector.

According to reports, the visitor was on the guest list and did in fact attend the dinner that was hosted at the White House. Over the last few months, the White House has sounded a note of warning concerning visitors with ties to China’s communist party, noting that they pose a potential national security threat. However, reports claim the administration left the door open to a member of the Chinese government group during the dinner, where he had access to the White House and President Donald Trump. United States President Donald Trump launched his meme coin, TRUMP , just days before his inauguration. To further push the sales of the token, there was a contest in April where it was announced that the top buyers of the token would have access to a tour of the White House and a private dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club. Chinese investor with government ties attended Trump’s dinner According to government documents in China examined by The New York Times, one of the buyers and attendees was He Tianying, a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The group, which has ties to the communist party, is an advisory body that seeks to broaden the party’s influence and solicit support from influential people in China. Tianying, who was registered at the Trump dinner as a resident of Hong Kong, advises the Chinese government through his role as a delegate of the Fangshan CPPCC, a district of Beijing. According to records, he is a member of the organization’s science and technology committee. While The New York Times noted that there is no record of him being an official member of the communist party, his activity with the government body is on a low level. There were no restrictions on who could purchase the TRUMP meme coin, with the sale open to foreign nationals. While the winning buyers were promised an opportunity for proximity to the president, it remains unclear why Tianying attended the event. However, at a time when the United States administration has been trying to revoke the visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party, this incident shows a weakness in the background checks the administration did on the dinner’s guests. The White House crypto dinner and its criticism Once a crypto skeptic, Trump made a U-turn months before the election in November 2024, declaring himself a cryptocurrency enthusiast. The move raised ethical concerns and questioned the lines between personal business ventures and the presidency. His family company also issued its cryptocurrency, promoting the TRUMP meme coin heavily since it launched. After the launch, buyers started to accumulate the token, with the top 220 holders earning a dinner with the president. The buyers used several nicknames that disguised their identities, but the Times obtained a copy of several pages of an official sign-in sheet for the dinner and has been looking into the biographies of many of the attendees. Tianying, who adopted the nickname Sky, owned about $3.7 million worth of the meme coin. The details were obtained from public records at the time the contest ended, where the Chinese ranked as the seventh largest buyer of the meme coin, entitling him to a gold-colored VIP wristband for the event. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the dinner was a private event, and officials in the government were not closely involved. She maintained that it was not an official White House event. This statement came after the meme coin dinner saw strong criticisms from Democrats, government watchdogs, and even some Republicans. They saw the event as a move by the president’s business partners to enrich the first family, with Trump speaking behind the presidential seal during the event.

With $1,000 to invest today, two names stand out, Ripple (XRP) and a new cryptocurrency called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . XRP often cited among the best crypto coins to buy brings strong institutional backing and real-world utility trading around $2.20 with bullish momentum building. Meanwhile Mutuum Finance currently under $1 is gaining traction for its DeFi use case and breakout potential. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first launched in presale, MUTM will officially go live at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). As market momentum builds, these alternatives are being closely watched by those asking what crypto to buy now and aiming for outsized returns in 2025. Presale picks up speed: Mutuum Finance takes the lead Mutuum Finance continues to gather momentum as Phase 4 of its presale sold out ahead of schedule. In Phase 5 currently tokens are set at $0.03 giving investors a 16.67% return right off the bat once the price increases in the next round. The presale has already raised over $10.2 million and attracted more than 11,700 investors. With demand on the rise and sound fundamentals most are hoping for even greater returns after launch as MUTM makes a case for itself as among the top altcoins to invest in 2025. Innovative buy-and-distribute model Unlike most speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance carries out its Buy-and-Distribute strategy. After buying MUTM tokens on the open market, the project will give each staker a portion which means some tokens will be taken out of circulation. Everyone is invited to participate and raise the demand by using the platform. Early investors reward With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for cheering the project in the beginning. Stablecoin launch & Certik audit build investor trust Mutuum Finance is releasing a dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Compared to unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, Mutuum’s stablecoin is properly collateralized, so it maintains a constant price and user trust. The smart contracts of the platform have been extensively audited by Certik, a name as renowned in blockchain security as it gets. All factors combined, security of its token and clear audit verifications help Mutuum Finance successfully blends proven progress with active users taking part in the project’s community. For daring investors, it gives them a chance to help a DeFi project in its early stages. Mutuum Finance is set to compete with Solana (SOL) in 2025, having gained over 1,700 investors and $10.2 million in funding. In Phase 5 the token is priced at only $0.03 and those who take part early can expect a two-fold return on their investment when the price reaches $0.06. Mutuum’s smart contracts as well as its coming USD-backed stablecoin and Buy-and-Distribute model are one of a kind in the DeFi space. Now is the time to buy Mutuum Finance before it’s too late.

With its price currently around $2.26, investors and analysts alike are keenly watching the next moves in its journey. Emergence of Competitors: XYZVerse While XRP is eyeing institutional acceptance, new entities like XYZVerse are entering the scene, captivating retail traders with its sports-themed meme coin approach. Key Catalysts for XRP's Growth Anticipated ETF Approval The SEC's decision on a potential XRP ETF, expected by June 17, is a pivotal moment for XRP. An approval could attract significant institutional investment, similar to previous impacts seen with Bitcoin ETFs. This development would enhance liquidity and change the market sentiment towards crypto, propelling XRP into mainstream financial discussions. Legal Milestones Ripple's recent settlement with the SEC, where it agreed to pay a reduced fine of $50 million, has provided the necessary legal clarity and restored confidence among investors, setting a solid ground for future growth. Global Adoption and Technological Advances Ripple is not just focusing on the U.S. market; it's expanding globally. For instance, the approval of its new stablecoin in Dubai marks a significant step in its international strategy. Moreover, the integration of AI technologies in the XRP Ledger could revolutionize real-time data application and compliance processes, pushing XRP further into essential financial infrastructures. Market Dynamics and Technical Insights Recent on-chain data indicates increasing accumulation by large XRP holders, a bullish sign typically preceding upward price movements. Technical indicators support this optimism, suggesting a strong buy momentum with XRP trading well above its critical moving averages. Source: TradingView Exploring the $10 Target The question on everyone's mind: Can XRP reach $10? Given the right mix of ETF approval, continuous global expansion, and favorable market conditions, this target is ambitious yet achievable. Some experts even predict a potential rise to $15-$20 by 2026, contingent upon broader adoption across banking and financial sectors. The Challenger: XYZVerse In contrast to XRP's structured market approach, XYZVerse appeals to a different market segment through its sports-themed meme coin. Its partnership with a sportsbook and comprehensive roadmap for development are set to carve a niche in the rapidly expanding crypto market. Moreover, its proactive security measures, including a smart contract audit and KYC verifications, enhance its attractiveness to cautious investors. Conclusion: A Race of Giants and Newcomers As the digital currency landscape evolves, XRP's march towards $10 appears backed by substantial developments and a growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, XYZVerse's innovative take on integrating cryptocurrencies with sports and entertainment shows the diverse potential of the crypto market to capture various consumer segments. Both tokens present unique opportunities and challenges, reflecting the dynamic nature of the crypto industry. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meta De Table of Contents XYZ memecoin prepares for major CEX listing as presale gains heat Cardano Conclusion Cardano’s ADA token is approaching a significant price milestone, nearing the $5 mark. Yet, an unexpected competitor valued at just $0.003333 is gaining even greater traction. This low-cost asset is showing remarkable strength, outpacing more established players. What is driving this surge, and could this affordable token become the next big thing in the market? You might also like: XYZVerse, Chainlink, and Stellar: The crypto giants reshaping global finance in 2025 XYZ memecoin prepares for major CEX listing as presale gains heat XYZVerse (XYZ) is quickly becoming one of the hottest memecoins of 2025, making headlines with its bold goal: a run from $0.0001 to $0.10. So far, the presale has already raised over $13 million, with the token price now sitting at $0.003333 — more than 30x from its launch. The next presale stage (13th) will push the price to $0.005, giving early buyers one of the last chances to lock in before a planned major CEX listing. While the team hasn’t named the exchange yet, teasers point to a high-profile debut. More than a meme — it’s a movement XYZVerse isn’t built for spectators. It’s designed for the fearless; crypto warriors, sports fanatics, and profit-hunters who live for the next breakout play. At the heart of the project is XYZepe, a symbol of grit in the meme coin ring, battling for a shot at top-tier status alongside DOGE and SHIB. Massive airdrops and a community that wins XYZVerse puts the power in the hands of its community. With 10% of the total supply — a whopping 10 billion $XYZ — set aside for airdrops, it’s one of the biggest community reward campaigns in the space. Active users, contributors, and early believers stand to benefit the most. With solid tokenomics, incoming exchange listings, and regular token burns, XYZVerse is building real momentum. Whether someone is here for the airdrops, the adrenaline, or the upside — now could be the time to get in. Airdrops, rewards, and more — join XYZVerse to unlock all the benefits. Cardano Cardano (ADA) has been navigating a volatile market, with its current price fluctuating between $0.63 and $0.76. In the past week, the coin saw a decline of 9.49%, reflecting short-term bearish sentiment. However, over the last month, it managed a modest increase of 1.96%, indicating some resilience. Despite this, the six-month view reveals a significant drop of 45.00%, highlighting ongoing challenges for ADA. The coin is approaching its nearest support level at $0.58, which could play a crucial role in stabilizing its price. If ADA holds above this support, there’s potential to retest the nearest resistance level at $0.83, offering a possible uptick from current levels. Breaking through could lead to the second resistance at $0.95, representing a notable percentage increase. Conversely, slipping below the support may see ADA testing the next support at $0.46, which would signify further downside. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are closely aligned at $0.67 and $0.68, suggesting limited momentum in either direction. The Relative Strength Index stands at 47.80, slightly below the neutral 50 mark, hinting at marginal bearish pressure. The Stochastic indicator reads 56.64, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Additionally, the MACD level is negative at -0.0036, pointing to subdued bullish momentum. These factors suggest that ADA may continue to trade within its current range in the near term. Conclusion While ADA and others perform well, XYZVerse leads with stronger momentum, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for massive growth and sustainable success.

On Thursday, Circle Internet Financial made a stunning debut on the New York Stock Exchange, soaring 168% as investors rallied behind the company that issues USDC—the second biggest stablecoin after Tether. By Friday, Circle’s stock was up another 38%, underscoring the growing investor appetite for digital assets tethered to fiat currencies. Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, captured the mood in a Bloomberg interview, declaring, “The world has already woken up to the fact that stablecoin money is here to stay.” Circle’s eye-catching debut arrives just as lawmakers prepare to pass a bill that could overhaul the $250 billion stablecoin market and redefine how digital dollars are used. That sentiment now seems to be shared by a widening circle of corporate leaders, policymakers, and financial institutions. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin gains traction Ripple, another heavyweight in the crypto payments space, has quietly expanded its reach. In December 2024, the company launched RLUSD—a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued on both the Ethereum blockchain and XRP Ledger. While it initially debuted on select global exchanges, RLUSD has recently gained regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority , allowing its use within the Dubai International Financial Centre. This approval not only integrates RLUSD into Ripple’s licensed payment platform but also authorizes its use by other regulated firms operating in the DIFC. Ripple’s dual strategy—supporting both crypto-native infrastructure and institutional compliance—highlights the hybrid approach now defining the stablecoin space. Big banks quietly explore issuing a shared stablecoin The country’s largest banks—including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo—are reportedly in early discussions to create a jointly issued stablecoin , according to the Wall Street Journal. These conversations, involving companies like Early Warning Services (the operator of Zelle) and the Clearing House, reflect growing anxiety over losing ground in the rapidly shifting payments landscape. A unified banking stablecoin would serve not only to preserve incumbents’ influence over the $5 trillion US payments industry but also to compete with emerging crypto-native solutions. The idea remains in its infancy, but sources say the goal is to develop a token usable across institutions and eventually even outside the banking sector. Deutsche Bank AG is also examining stablecoins and different forms of tokenized deposits. Germany’s largest lender is evaluating stablecoin options, which could include issuing its own token or joining an industrywide initiative, Sabih Behzad, Deutsche Bank’s head of digital assets and currencies transformation, said in an interview. Source : The Block From Uber to Stripe: tech and fintech players test the waters The momentum is not confined to banks. At the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on June 5, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi revealed that the ride-hailing company is actively evaluating stablecoins as a cheaper, faster method for moving money globally. “We’re still in the study phase, I’d say, but stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,” he said. John Collison, co-founder of payments giant Stripe, also told Bloomberg in May that the company had begun early discussions with banks about integrating stablecoins into their services. PayPal, meanwhile, has already taken the leap: its stablecoin, PYUSD, launched in 2023, was used in its first commercial transaction in 2024 to pay Ernst & Young. The GENIUS Act: Capitol Hill readies first major stablecoin legislation Adding fuel to the fire is a major legislative milestone. The GENIUS Act—short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins of 2025”—is expected to pass the US Senate within days . If enacted, it would provide the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoin regulation, creating clear rules around issuance, reserve requirements, and consumer protections. Supporters, including crypto industry players who poured significant funds into election campaigns, say the bill would bring much-needed legitimacy to the market and catalyze institutional adoption. Christian Catalini, founder of MIT’s cryptoeconomics lab, said the bill could trigger competition between Wall Street firms and crypto startups to issue their own stablecoins. Some lawmakers express concerns However, not everyone is on board. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, has pledged to vote against the bill in its current form, warning that it hands too much financial control to tech firms. “It’s a huge giveaway to Big Tech,” he told reporters. Hawley expressed concern that tech companies could issue stablecoins with limited oversight and then leverage them to expand surveillance of users’ financial behavior. “It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls,” he said. “I don’t see why we would do that.” These are not unfounded fears. Facebook’s earlier stablecoin project—originally known as Libra and later Diem—died in 2022 after intense regulatory backlash, including from Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, who cited “serious concerns” about the implications for global monetary policy. The promise and peril of stablecoins Despite growing institutional interest, stablecoins are not without risk. Their fundamental appeal lies in their price stability—most are pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar or other assets. Yet history has shown that not all pegs hold. In 2022, TerraUSD—an algorithmic stablecoin—collapsed, wiping out billions in value and sparking a crisis of confidence in the asset class. “If the assets backing the coin drop in value and the one-to-one peg falls apart, it could cause the equivalent of a bank run,” warned Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford, in a CNN report . There are also practical concerns: users losing access to wallets, a lack of transparency in reserve holdings, and security vulnerabilities still haunt the market. But these concerns have not dulled the enthusiasm of corporations looking to bypass slow, expensive traditional rails in favor of more agile digital payments. A turning point for money itself As Circle’s IPO excitement ripples through Wall Street and the GENIUS Act inches closer to becoming law, stablecoins are no longer on the fringes of finance. They’re fast becoming one of its most consequential innovations. What began as a speculative experiment in crypto trading is now poised to reshape everything from remittances and business-to-business payments to how we define and distribute money. Whether powered by banks, tech giants, or crypto-native firms, the stablecoin era is here, and it’s moving fast.

The new category of “intermediary business” alleviates the need for middleman companies in Japan to register as exchanges, but the bill has other implications, some of which bring stricter rules and greater centralization. Originally submitted to the Japan Diet back in March, the amendments to the Payment Services Act passed on Friday , and are being praised as pro-crypto.Perhaps drawing the most attention is the establishment of a new category of “intermediary business,” meaning businesses who introduce or act as liaisons between exchangers and users. Such groups will no longer have to register as an exchange with the government’s regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA).A separate registration, with relaxed rules, will be introduced for these intermediaries. Image: Chihiro Sakai . What’s in the new law: Stablecoins, intermediary businesses, emergency outflow barriers Under FSA discussion since November last year, the amended Payment Services Act is being cited by regional media as likely removing barriers for gaming companies and others that want to do business related to cryptocurrency and digital assets.Interest from Mercari, SBI Securities, and Monex Securities has already been reported regarding registering as an “intermediary business.”Some key changes to the act are as follows: Creation of “intermediary” businesses with relaxed registration rules. Creation of a separate registration system for exchanges. New ability to issue a legal order requiring overseas-based crypto firms to hold assets in Japan to prevent outflows in case of bankruptcy. “Trust-type” stablecoin backing assets can now be held partially (up to 50%) in low-risk investments like government bonds, instead of being 100% backed in fiat by the issuer. Stricter rules for businesses deemed overseas “collection agencies” providing e-commerce services. FSA chart detailing changes to trust-type stablecoin regulations. Source: FSA . The amended law, set to take effect within one year, essentially cements strict AML/CFT requirements and rules for registered exchange operators and e-commerce collection agencies, eases entry to the regulated crypto ecosystem for liaison businesses (which must be under the supervision of a registered operator), prevents overseas exchanges from running off with Japanese users’ money, and helps banks issue stablecoins more easily. Centralization, stricter rules — Drifting further from Satoshi While it’s understandable that gaming enterprises and others are happy to hear the news of the amendment’s success, and removal of barriers to entry, Tokyo and Japan-based adherents to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original idea of separation of money and state will see the law as a nothing-burger. Or a poison apple, more accurately.Massive banks can now issue stablecoins more easily, leveraging state credit, while overseas, permissionless markets and competitors are further targeted as threats.As Coinpost reported in 2022 of a Mitsubishi UFJ working group focused on stablecoins: “The aim is to put a stop to the current situation in which funds are flowing mainly into overseas stablecoins, including through investment in overseas Web3 (decentralized app) projects, use of major NFT markets, and even cover trading in cryptocurrency exchanges.” Businesses that handle money deemed cross-border “collection agencies” involved with activities such as e-commerce can also be regulated under the revised PSA. Source: FSA . Crackdown on foreign payment agents deemed cross-border “collection agencies,” such as those involved with e-commerce, is a slippery slope. The FSA notes it will not go after low-risk activities or require registration from low-risk intermediaries, while threatening a crackdown on online casinos and fraud, noting that “Those who conduct illegal remittances, such as online casinos and investment fraud, will be subject to regulation as unregistered businesses” under the new amendment.As with all legislation, arbitrary political interpretation allows for endless abuse. Previously, cross-border collection agencies were not required to register as a funds transfer business with the state. Now, they must rely on the FSA’s assurances only, in a state of relative limbo.Fortunately for the advocates of peer-to-peer, permissionless transactions, no matter what the new regulations bring, use of actual crypto — not regulated, bank-issued stablecoins — remains one path toward economic freedom and peace in Japan, in a time of a faltering yen, rice shortages , and mainstream monetary malaise.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitcoin firebrand Michael Saylor says that as institutions enter the top crypto asset by market cap, BTC should experience a supply shock and a surge in price. “There’s been a surge of Bitcoin treasury companies. There’s like 100 public companies or more. They’re holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And every single week, there’s another announcement. I think that it used to be that we’re focused on the halvings. But at this point, the entire natural supply of Bitcoin is only 450 Bitcoin available for sale every day. That’s sort of about $45 – $50 million a day at this level. That is all being consumed by the Bitcoin treasury companies. And the Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are coming on strong. So I’m very bullish.” Saylor goes on to slightly upgrade his price prediction for the flagship digital asset, noting that he believes it will outpace other key asset classes, such as real estate and the S&P 500. “My forecast in July of last year in Nashville was Bitcoin’s going to appreciate 29% a year on average for the next 21 years. And that moves it from it was about mid $60s, $65,000 to $13 million a coin in the year 2045. I’m getting more bullish on that forecast, but I’m certainly comfortable forecasting 30% a year ARR (annual recurring revenue) on average for the next 20 years. I think Bitcoin’s up 57% a year for the past four and a half years. Again, that’s double the Mag seven. That’s quadruple the S&P. That’s eight times real estate and bonds are down 4%. So Bitcoin is smashing everything.” Strategy is currently the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, coming in at 580,955 BTC worth just over $61.3 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. Bitcoin is trading for $105,431 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

While firms like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet are going all-in on Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation, others are cautiously experimenting, often as a hedge against inflation, rising interest rates, and fiat debasement. Yet critics warn that many of these companies are financially shaky, using the coin more as a speculative lifeline than a strategic asset. Analysts are split between seeing this trend as forward-thinking financial engineering or a “dumpster fire.” The rise of corporate Bitcoin treasuries reflects both the promise and peril of crypto’s expanding influence in global capital markets. According to BitBo , as of June 6, over 70 public companies were holding Bitcoin. It’s understood that companies like Strategy and Metaplanet are fully dedicated to accumulation. However, some other corporations are dipping their toes into Bitcoin stacking while continuing to work in a different sphere. Serious question: How many of these random companies stacking BTC on their balance sheet are just doing it for the PR? — Nic (@nicrypto) June 5, 2025 ‘Dumpster fire in the making’ Journalist and analyst Sean Williams expressed his concerns over the possible failure of the Bitcoin treasury companies, citing the lack of innovation and operational success as the drivers of the potential bust. He called the BTC treasury hype a “dumpster fire in the making.” He pointed out that many companies resorting to launching a BTC treasury are not profitable in the first place, so they try to make quick money out of crypto volatility. This emphasizes their weaknesses. Strategy’s stock performance was one of the worst in February 2025. He named several instances when the BTC price saw significant downfalls as an example of the potential risk for such companies. On top of that, Williams sees the scarcity and 21 million hard cap narratives as “mythical” due to the potential possibility of changing the BTC limit. Technically, it’s not impossible. When BlackRock outlined such a possibility in the company’s educational animation, the reaction from Bitcoin maximalists was antagonistic. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin on X expressed doubts that the “random” companies launching Bitcoin treasuries won’t sell their BTC in the bear market. Thus, he brings up these companies’ alleged superficial engagement in Bitcoin and warns about the potential harm to the crypto market.

While some veterans could get annoyed by seeing their favorite crypto gets “appropriated” by the new players with money, the reasons for adopting corporate Bitcoin treasuries have strong macroeconomic grounds. In an in-depth study , Fidelity analysts note that the last five years saw an increase in publicly traded companies that allocate part of their capital in Bitcoin, which is seen as a hedge against increasing fiscal deficits, fiat currency debasement, and risks associated with geopolitical turbulence. Fidelity emphasizes that this approach is unorthodox for big companies, as in previous decades, they held their funds in low-risk assets, such as bank deposits or treasury bills. According to Fidelity, the growing economic uncertainty undermined trust in traditional strategies. Corporate treasuries’ need for uncorrelated capital grew in the 2020s as interest rates hit high, reducing liquidity and cash flows. However, if the interest rate drops, the yields of companies having substantial reserves of traditional funds will also go down. The study calls the response to COVID-19 “unprecedented” as the cumulative stimulus payments of the biggest economies amounted to $10 trillion, which is three times higher than during the 2008 crisis period. Inflation rates surged, causing a decline in corporate treasuries’ purchasing power. These factors made many investors look for new solutions, and soon many, including public companies, saw a solution in Bitcoin. Given that the regulations in the EU and the U.S. have been Bitcoin-friendly, investors started to accumulate digital assets with more confidence. The study mentions such regulations including: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs The EU’s MiCA framework adoption The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s rule change from 2023, which allowed Bitcoin holding companies to account for and represent value in their financial statements more precisely. Considering the ascending Bitcoin price, it made companies’ balance sheets look stronger. As Bitcoin has been resistant to demand shocks and could serve as a financial cushion in the long run, it promised benefits for companies adding the coin to their balance sheets. According to Fidelity, Bitcoin can help companies survive the monetary debasement policy of central banks due to its verifiable scarcity. Analysts generally note that Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation was one of the main reasons for its popularity among corporations. The study names the companies pioneering allocation: The Block, MicroStrategy, Stone Ridge Holdings Group, and Selmer Scientific. ‘Crash test’ FOMO and game theory are often mentioned when people discuss reserves. These reserves cut the live liquidity, increasing an asset’s deficit on the markets while not necessarily pumping the price (as people quickly got used to “bullish” announcements). The trend is pretty young, and it needs to undergo a crash test so we can see if the companies stacking bitcoins are not the “tourists.” You might also like: BlackRock nears Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin, tops Strategy and Binance",Follow-up|BlackRock|education|Fidelity Investments|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-08 09:30:00

After a relatively stable period around the $2,500 zone, Ethereum broke below a neckline support level as last week drew to a close. This raises the question of whether a bearish continuation is already in motion for the Ethereum price or if bulls still have a shot at regaining momentum in the new week. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Head & Shoulders Pattern Confirmed After Breakdown Below $2,480 The Head and Shoulders pattern, one of the most recognizable reversal formations in technical analysis, is now clearly visible on Ethereum’s 4-hour candlestick chart. This chart and the technical outlook were first shared on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst MelikaTrader94. The structure includes a left shoulder, a prominent head peaking above $2,700, and a right shoulder that topped near $2,650. The neckline, drawn around $2,480, was breached during Ethereum’s recent pullback to $2,380. This, in turn, shifted the short-term outlook toward the bearish side. After the break, Ethereum attempted to reclaim lost ground and is currently retesting the neckline area. This retest around $2,500 is significant, as a failure to push back above this level significantly would likely validate the bearish setup and cause the Ethereum price to reverse downwards toward the next support zone. According to the outlook from analyst MelikaTrader94, the price target from this Head and Shoulders breakdown before any notable rebound upward can occur lies between $2,200 and $2,250. Chart Image From TradingView: MelikaTrader94 Bulls Must Reclaim $2,650 To Invalidate Bearish Setup A confluence of factors supports the $2,200 region as a likely landing zone. Not only is this level consistent with the measured move of the Head and Shoulders pattern, but it also aligns with an order block on May 9 during Ethereum’s rally above $2,000 at the time. This adds further technical relevance to the $2,200 to $2,250 range acting as a support zone. However, the situation is not fully bearish yet. The path forward is clear but narrow for Ethereum bulls. The first step to invalidate the bearish setup is to reclaim the neckline around $2,500 decisively. Beyond that, breaking back above the right shoulder level around $2,650 would invalidate the Head and Shoulders pattern, and another pattern will most likely come into play.

Analyst Highlights The Trigger A successful bullish reclaim would not only nullify the bearish pattern but could also revive sentiment for another retest of the $2,700 to $2,800 zone, which corresponds to the peak of the head in the recently formed pattern. Until such a recovery occurs, the Ethereum price can quickly reverse downwards at any time. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,510.

AI has been evolving at breakneck speed and is becoming an indispensable and useful tool across many industries for business and consumer-facing functions, including the finance industry. The fast adoption of AI is largely driven by its low barriers to entry, where anyone with a computer and internet connection can interact with AI and develop it. Yet, as AI grows, it brings severe risks: AI is already sufficiently advanced to assist human-led hacking through LLMs and AI agents. You might also like: AI is crypto’s redemption, and the next generation’s big bet | Opinion Within five years, AI will develop capabilities to hack on another, far more dangerous front: through Artificial General Intelligence. Once AGI is achieved, it won’t be controlled by people. Unless governments and regulators step in now (even then, the chances of controlling it are slim), AGI will escape the confines of its creators and autonomously hack cryptocurrency encryptions… and entire global digital systems. The rise of artificial intelligence AI has seen a dramatic surge in the commercial arena, one of its most recent iterations being AI agents. These are finely tuned, complicated systems, geared to perform specialized tasks and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Already transforming the tech space and becoming a useful everyday tool for many basic human interactions, such as self-driving cars, fraud detection , on-chain trading, and application creation. The next evolution will be AGI , a complex system that can do everything a human can. It will not need human prompts or intervention; it will simply have real-time autonomy: the ability to perform tasks, but also recognise when a task needs performing. This is set to be achieved in the next two years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk have made public statements declaring clear roadmaps to achieve AGI; regardless of who gets there first, time will decide whether they are a hero or the destroyers of worlds. Potential evolution of use cases: Friend and foe Alongside positive innovations, AI is facilitating amoral actors. LLMs and AI agents are being used to assist hacking. LLMs get jailbroken to produce malware and are being used for targeted scamming, such as faking voices in phone calls to incite money transfers from unsuspecting victims. An open-sourced AI Agent can be used by malicious actors for targeted scams, tasked with finding, tracking, tracing, and infiltrating a target—never ending until it achieves its goal. One key vulnerability on the horizon lies in the potential for AGI to break cryptographic encryptions. Bitcoin ( BTC ) encryption hacking is already a growing market, but is currently limited to the realm of quantum computing , which has an incredibly high barrier to entry—it requires extreme assets, resources, and technical capabilities that the average hacker does not possess. Crypto encryption hacking has been limited to a small handful of individuals who are legally paying for the services of quantum computing firms to unlock their wallets and recover funds for a hefty finder’s fee. Encryption hacking will not always be bound to the limits of quantum computing. AGI presents much lower barriers to entry and will leverage technology that man has not even yet discovered. AI + bad actors = death of crypto Once AI has advanced to the point where it can hack encryption, the level of criminals using this tool will dramatically increase. Usage will extend well beyond innocent crypto investors trying to recover funds. Hackers will use AI agents sufficiently advanced to target and exploit these weaknesses in our financial systems. Particularly as there are many amoral groups that lack quantum computing skills, actively interested in the weaponisation of AI, for example, the North Korean Lazarus Group, infamous for financial hacks , poses a real danger. We are looking at far more devastating effects than just scams and theft. North Korea will use it as a digital weapon, destroying existing financial systems. Beyond the weaponisation of AI by unfriendly states and actors lies the potential for AGI to go rogue from its creators. Once this happens, one of the first aspects after decentralizing itself, through infiltrating digital networks to become untraceable to avoid being switched off, will be to gather financial resources. The most likely target is the financial markets, specifically crypto. It would try to access digital capital by tracking high-frequency traders, forging accounts, and hacking online bank accounts. It would also break encryption methods for Bitcoin and all major cryptocurrencies. In the blink of an eye, it will be able to hack every single wallet that has ever existed and immediately secure the assets by selling them on the chain for gold, bonds, and fiat currencies, all before any centralised authority could respond. If an AI can crack all the private keys for crypto wallets, why would it not do so within minutes, stealing and selling all of the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and then diversifying into other assets? It would, and it will. Any hope for crypto (and humankind)? Without proactive counter-strategies, AGI could dismantle cryptocurrencies and very quickly take control of all human finances. As a complex, non-deterministic system, AGI is a technology where the safety rails imposed by governments are most needed; managing these risks requires exceptional cooperation and sophistication across many actors and institutions. Yet this is the first time a world-changing technology has not been spearheaded by the government, but instead by private corporations. From the Manhattan Project to microprocessors, the internet, GPS, and digital cameras, these are all technologies that originated from government-run projects for defense, which were subsequently commercialized for consumers (except for the bomb). Silicon Valley is at the forefront of AI, placing us in a unique position in history where the scale and speed of distribution, versus government oversight, may not be sufficient to prevent major negative impacts. AI will transform society, but once AI proves extremely smart and capable, there will be little to stop the ‘wrong hands’ from developing harmful AI tools. AGI starts a countdown timer until it breaks free from its creator’s chains and moves into the real world. The risks are not exclusive to financial markets, but apply to the whole digital landscape, IoT devices, electrical grids, and so much more. Crypto is but a means to an end for AI, a means to gather wealth. Crypto is purely the financial vessel for the worst-case scenario to unfold.

Ardoino took to blogging platform X, saying that the stablecoin issuer has no such plans, days after its rival Circle made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Ardoino mentioned it while he was replying to a post about the company’s valuation. The post came days after Circle, which is behind the USDC stablecoin, entered the public market. Circle performed well on its first day, with its shares climbing 167% on its first trading session on the NYSE. The company’s shares opened at $31, before moving up by 235% in the first hours of negotiation, before closing at $82 at the end of the day. The performance showed that there is a growing market appetite for the stablecoin business. Tether CEO discusses Tether’s valuation Ardoino also addressed the speculation raised by Artemis CEO Jon Ma, who was speaking about Tether’s valuation. Ma mentioned that if Tether, who backs the USDT stablecoin were to go public, it would rank as the 19th largest company globally. He backed his claim with a table showing different companies and their current valuation. The table had companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon, among others. Tether valuation at 515B is a beautiful number. Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + Gold treasury, yet I'm very humbled. Also truly excited for the next phase of growth of our company. Thank you everyone❤️ https://t.co/exZc05SDwd — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 7, 2025 In his postulation, he noted that Tether, with a valuation of around $515 billion, will be larger than global giants like Costco and Coca-Cola. However, Ardoino was not impressed with the valuation. The Tether CEO noted that while the $515 billion valuation was a beautiful number, it might actually be too low for the company. “Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + gold treasury, yet I’m very humbled,” Ardoino said. Ardoino added that he is excited for the next stage of Tether’s growth . Meanwhile, popular Bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano also backed Ardoino’s stance, highlighting that the company has what it takes to hit the $1 trillion mark eventually. The stance was also shared by another prominent figure in the community, Jack Mallers, who mentioned that he hopes the company eventually reaches the valuation very soon. New inroads and investments Tether-backed stablecoin USDT currently ranks as the third-largest in the cryptocurrency market by market cap. It is valued at $154.83 billion at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap. The company has also been making investments in the crypto market, announcing in April that it would become a majority owner of Twenty One Capital, a new Bitcoin treasury company founded by Strike executive Jack Mallers. Despite its recent launch, Twenty One has become the third-largest holder of Bitcoin, coming behind Strategy (MicroStrategy) and mining firm MARA Holdings. Some days ago, Tether moved 37,229 Bitcoin, worth about $3.9 billion into the Bitcoin native financial platform. According to his post on X, he made three transactions totaling 25,812 BTC worth about $2.7 billion at the time before making a $730 million transfer and following it up with a $500 million BTC transfer. Twenty One Capital wants to develop Bitcoin-native capital markets infrastructure, allowing products like lending, custody, and asset issuance to operate directly on Bitcoin rails. It also has plans to go public using a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger that would involve Cantor Fitzgerald’s Cantor Equity Partners, which values the company at $3.6 billion.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI enters bonus round at $0.007 after $21m raised, gaining momentum as Solana seeks a fresh price catalyst. The blockchain industry is gaining attention as Lightchain AI enters its bonus round. After successfully completing all 15 presale stages, the bonus round is now live at a fixed price of $0.007. Lightchain AI has already secured nearly $21 million in early support, reflecting the platform’s rapid growth and rising prominence within the sector. This milestone highlights Lightchain AI’s unique approach and its strong appeal to investors, distinguishing it in a highly competitive market. Meanwhile, Solana, once a shining star, finds itself at a crossroads, waiting for a much-needed catalyst to revive its price action and regain momentum. With contrasting narratives unfolding, we’ll explore what Lightchain AI’s success means for the market and what Solana needs to spark its comeback. Stay tuned as we break it all down.

Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reflects that bearish trend, possible support can be found around the $140 level. Despite the short-term pressures, the fundamentals of Solana are not weak. The network has been gaining attention from institutions because of its high throughput and low transaction fees making it a favorite for DApps and DeFi projects. Analysts anticipate that if market conditions would continue to remain positive and if the SEC approve their operations, SOL could break for a second time and test resistance levels at $200 in the next coming months. The short-term headwinds notwithstanding, its ecosystem strength and constant momentum in work-in-progress make Solana a potential candidate for recovery and growth once the markets start turning around.

Experts Point to Under-$0.035 Entry as Key Advantage,https://timestabloid.com/could-mutuum-finance-mutm-be-the-next-5-crypto-experts/,"The crypto world has a habit of turning small bets into massive gains. Those who spotted Solana (SOL) before its breakout or jumped into early Polygon (MATIC) know how fast narratives shift in favor of undervalued tokens with real utility. Today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention as a rare under-$0.035 gem with a powerful combination of yield mechanics, protocol innovation, and momentum. With expert voices pointing toward a long-term target of $5, the current entry price looks like a golden window — and it’s rapidly closing. $0.01 to $0.030: Early Backers Already Tripled Their Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched its presale at $0.01. Today, it’s in Phase 5 priced at $0.030, marking a 200% increase. That means anyone who entered during Phase 1 has already tripled their money, without even waiting for the token to hit public exchanges. With over $10.10 million raised and more than 11,700 holders onboard, the presale’s next phases will push MUTM’s price higher, squeezing the profit margin for latecomers. Entering now means locking in the last low-tier pricing before the sixth phase pushes the token to $0.035 — a point where the same $1,000 investment delivers fewer tokens and smaller gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stand out for one reason above all: it will generate actual passive income. The platform will support both P2C (pooled) and P2P (direct) lending models. In the P2C structure, users will be able to deposit assets like ETH or DAI into lending pools that automatically adjust interest rates based on demand. For example, depositing $10,000 in ETH will earn up to 12% annually, depending on utilization. A $5,000 deposit in DAI will secure around 8% yearly. These will not be inflated marketing numbers — they will be yield rates adjusted in real-time to reflect actual borrowing activity. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will gain an edge over simple staking on Solana or BNB Chain. Instead of waiting for validators to distribute unpredictable yields, investors on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will get immediate, algorithm-driven returns based on pool demand. Unlocking Hidden Markets with P2P Lending One of the most exciting aspects of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its peer-to-peer (P2P) lending functionality. While traditional DeFi platforms will continue to support only a limited set of blue-chip tokens for lending and borrowing, P2P on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will allow users to lend and borrow memecoins and trending tokens like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. These assets are generally excluded from standard pool-based (P2C) models, making them harder to leverage for yield. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DOGE holder will be able to directly lend out tokens and earn high-interest returns from borrowers seeking short-term liquidity. This will open up a whole new market segment and attract users from speculative communities, without compromising the protocol’s security or decentralization. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual-lending engine works in practice and has already attracted more than $10 million in committed capital. The protocol features a buyback mechanism that redirects revenue toward token value appreciation. Holders who stake mtTokens gain access to passive dividends, creating a financial incentive to hold longer. What makes MUTM even more attractive is its development on a Layer-2 infrastructure. This ensures fast, low-cost transactions while avoiding the congestion that regularly slows down Ethereum-based DeFi protocols. Layer-2 efficiency combined with real-world yield means users can engage with the platform freely, without gas fees eroding their profits. A Stablecoin That Strengthens the Ecosystem The next major milestone in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is the launch of a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. This isn’t another copy of USDT or USDC — it’s backed by real on-chain assets locked within the protocol. The supply will be algorithmically adjusted to maintain price stability, while interest payments from the stablecoin lending process flow directly back into the treasury. The team behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a major portion of Phase 1 goals. The presale was initiated, a $100,000 giveaway began , and the MUTM smart contract successfully passed an external CertiK audit. The protocol is listed on major tracking platforms, and an AI-powered helpdesk has been implemented to support user onboarding. As development enters Phase 2, the platform is building out its core smart contracts, DApp interface, back-end systems, and advanced features. Code reviews and risk management tools are actively being developed. These milestones show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just talking about its future — it’s building it. A Tight Window Before the Next Phase Once Phase 6 of the presale begins, the token price jumps to $0.035. That change reduces investor upside and increases the cost of entry. The difference between $0.01 and $0.030 has already delivered 200% gains for early participants. The next few phases won’t be as profitable — not because MUTM lacks growth potential, but because the discount window is closing fast. Getting in at $0.030 is the sweet spot — low enough to see a 35x return as the token approaches $1 and beyond, and early enough to maximize staking rewards from mtTokens and buyback dividends. Investors who commit now at the current price don’t just earn through token appreciation. They secure a position in one of the most dynamic, revenue-sharing, and community-focused DeFi ecosystems on the market. While others wait for exchange listings, the smart money is already flowing into Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It’s not a question of whether MUTM will go mainstream — it’s a matter of how soon. And $5 is no longer a dream; it’s the next stop on a roadmap filled with real milestones and unstoppable momentum.

The move followed a dip to $100,500 on June 5, but BTC/USD has since staged a steady recovery, nearing its weekly open. Bullish Momentum Reappears Popular analyst Rekt Capital noted signs of strength on the daily chart. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend… while also turning it into support earlier today,” he said on X. He added that a daily close and retest around $106,600 would solidify a bullish continuation. Other traders, like SuperBro, also pointed to Bitcoin closing above its 10-day simple moving average as a positive sign. That metric, according to SuperBro, helps invalidate bearish scenarios. Liquidity Signals Suggest Imminent Volatility Trader Cas Abbe examined order book liquidity and observed building pressure both above and below spot price. He suggested this setup could lead to a “magnet-style” price move. “BTC liquidation cluster is now signalling an upside move,” he said. Abbe noted that a 10% price increase could liquidate $15.11 billion in shorts, while a 10% drop would impact $9.58 billion in longs. He also pointed to negative funding rates as evidence of mounting short positions. “I think BTC big move is coming next week, possibly pushing it above $109K–$110K,” he predicted. Key Support Levels Remain in Focus Some analysts are still preparing for a possible retest of lower support zones. Trader CrypNuevo said $100,000 remains a strong psychological support. “100k is the strongest psychological support… it’s the area where I’m building some longs with easy invalidation below it,” he explained. Rekt Capital Eyes Weekly Close Importance Rekt Capital also highlighted the importance of Bitcoin holding above $104,400 for a fourth consecutive weekly close. He described the retest following May’s all-time highs as “successful,” adding further weight to bullish sentiment.

The Binance-backed platform has leapfrogged rivals like Uniswap ( UNI ) and Raydium ( RAY ), processing over $116 billion in monthly volume and racking up millions in fees and revenue. But even as the DEX sees explosive growth in usage, CAKE — its governance and utility token — has slipped from a late-May high of $2.95 to around $2.30, raising questions about whether market sentiment is out of sync with protocol fundamentals. This retreat brought its market valuation to about $745 million. Still, DeFi Llama data shows that PancakeSwap is now the biggest player in the decentralized exchange or DEX industry. The platform handled over $4.16 billion worth of volume in the last 24 hours, higher than Uniswap’s $1.6 billion and Raydium’s $529 million. It handled $116 billion in the last 30 days, while the two processed transactions worth $95 billion and $27 billion, respectively.

PancakeSwap DEX volume | Source: DeFi Llama This growth led to a big increase in fees and revenue. Its monthly fees rose to $131 million in May from $57 million a month earlier. Its revenue rose to $32 million from $14 million. More metrics on active CAKE addresses and staking have also jumped. CAKE price analysis PancakeSwap price chart shows that the CAKE price peaked at $2.94 on May 26 and then plunged to $2.30 today. | Source: crypto.news CAKE has remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest levels since May 11. It also remains above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The risk, however, is that the token has formed a small head and shoulders pattern. This pattern comprises a head, left and right shoulders, and a neckline, where it is today. Therefore, a break below these support levels will point to more downside, with the next point to watch being at $2. That implies a 13% drop below the current level.

Three standout cryptos priced under $0.30 are beginning to turn heads—and one of them is already being called an XRP killer. Lightchain AI , currently in presale at $0.007, has raised $18.3 million and is gaining traction for its bold approach to integrating artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. With its transparent ecosystem, scalable design, and growing investor base, Lightchain AI is projected by some analysts to reach as high as $12. Alongside two other undervalued tokens, this trio could be among the biggest gainers of the next bull cycle. Top 3 Cryptos Under $0.30 Ready to Surge ​With the crypto market rapidly expanding, it is inevitable for novice or budget-friendly investors to get confused about which cryptocurrencies to invest in. To start, one can choose the three investment opportunities listed, all of which are currently trading under $0.30. Dogecoin (DOGE) -Tongue-in-cheek as it may seem, the genesis of the Dogecoin digital currency was intended as a playful fun one. Dogecoin has now developed into a cryptocurrency token that has the firmest community and an army of high-profile endorsements. As of March 25, 2025, DOGE is trading at nearly $0.1858, meaning its price has risen by 6.15% in 24 hours. It is the increased use of DOGE as a means of payment to buy goods and services, and the addition of drivers within the ecosystem, which together with the efforts to develop it, places it in the position of realizing long-term returns. TRON (TRX) – TRON is the self-satisfied owner of the title given to the most ambitious projects in the ecosphere-decentralizing the internet. TRX is currently trading at $0.20. TRX has seen the development of multiple partnerships and is now a download base for different types of dApps on its platform. TRX’s score as a go-to solution for ensuring developers’ direct access to DLT is high because of its capacity to facilitate transaction speed and scalability. Lightchain AI (LCAI) – Lightchain AI technology that fuses AI and blockchain technology to the improvement of transaction speed and processing throughput. But as the LCAI token presale began, the truthful one showed that it had raised over $18.3 million at a price of $0.007 for buying over a hundred billion tokens. This token like many others has a real potential of becoming a market disruptor, if that becomes the case, the return could be staggering.​ While the potential for profit from these cryptocurrencies is encouraging an essential step is to do your homework thoroughly first and to find a reliable market before investing in it. Lightchain AI Dubbed the XRP Killer Aiming for $12 Lightchain AI is being dubbed the XRP Killer as it pushes toward a bold $12 target, backed by strong technical innovation. While XRP focuses on payments, Lightchain AI tackles real-time AI integration with blockchain, introducing scalable architecture and a Transparent AI Framework that ensures every computation is auditable and trustworthy. The platform addresses technical risks like scalability and resource limitations using sharding , model compression, and dynamic resource allocation—ensuring high performance even under complex AI workloads. Developers benefit from intuitive APIs and SDKs, which simplify AI model deployment and interaction with the platform. This blend of transparency, speed, and developer accessibility positions Lightchain AI as a next-gen solution that’s not just hype—but ready for mainstream adoption and dominance. Lightchain AI- Next Big Thing for 2025? Lightchain AI is turning heads with its game-changing approach and solid technical foundation, setting the stage for explosive growth. During its presale phase , the platform has already attracted massive investor interest, raising an impressive $18.3 million. The buzz doesn’t stop there. Experts predict LCAI could soar to $12 per token—a jaw-dropping leap from its current presale price of just $0.007.

As a result, PEPE and MUTM are attracting all the discussions as the top ones to invest in today. Analysts say that after its recent price consolidations, PEPE the meme coin could achieve a breakout and grow just like it did in early 2023. Affordable coins that offer unbalanced chances are perfect for risk-minded investors who may make $5,000 off a few dollars. While PEPE continues to trend across crypto charts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi project priced under, is being closely watched as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch ahead of a possible 100x rally. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 11,700 buyers are out there along with a total raise of $10.2 million. Investors who get in on this level will see a 100% return on investment when the token is sold at launch for $0.06. PEPE holds ground at $0.0000124 amid market volatility Pepe Coin (PEPE) is at $0.0000124, having risen 49% over the last month even after recently rising 10% and then correcting. Analysts say that if the current momentum persists, PEPE could see a 25% jump in June and go up to the $0.000016 levels. The token does have resistance at the $0.000015 level and would require a sustained breakout to go higher. Though PEPE remains a strong presence among leading cryptocurrencies, investors also start looking into emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in anticipation of even greater returns on investment within the cryptocurrency market. Mutuum Finance presale gains strong traction The Presale Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance is attracting investors since many believe in the strong model for the long term, different from the rapidly passing fads popular in meme coins. Due to its usefulness and expansion, Mutuum Finance is being noticed more in DeFi. So far, 11,700 people have invested over $10.2 million which makes Mutuum worth following. Anyone considering an early investment could check Phase 5 tokens which are being offered today for about $0.03. Improving communities meaningfully, by providing attractive incentives Helpful new features and outstanding rewards are being given to the Mutuum Finance community. The top 50 MUTM holders are shown on the leaderboard and they are set to receive extra tokens as a reward. 10 individuals from the project’s community have a chance to win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as there is a $100,000 giveaway too. A new generation of decentralized lending platform Mutuum Finance is famed for the way it combines different lending systems to give users stronger control and flexibility. Those who engage in P2C lending put their stablecoins into pools controlled by smart contracts. People who use P2P lending can decide the terms with the lender, rather than only having those terms set by the protocol itself. People gain privacy, control of their money and more autonomy which matches the main values of DeFi. Mutuum Finance and PEPE are quickly emerging as two of the most promising altcoins for investors aiming to flip a modest $50 into a potential $5,000. PEPE is holding steady at $0.0000124 and remains a hot meme coin with the potential for breakout gains, while Mutuum Finance offers a fundamentally stronger and utility-driven DeFi model. With over $10.2 million raised from 11,700+ investors, MUTM is gaining real traction. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of the presale and launching at $0.06, early buyers stand to double their investment immediately, with much larger gains possible post-launch. To seize this opportunity before the next price hike, and join the presale now.

SUI Set To Test Crucial $3.5 Resistance With ATH In View,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/breakout-in-sight-sui-set-to-test-crucial-3-5-resistance-with-ath-in-view/,"Popular market analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Sui (SUI) for an impending price breakout. Notably, the prominent altcoin has recorded a steady price decline in the past month with an estimated loss of 17.18% within this period. However, Pillows notes the formation of a bullish pattern which indicates substantial market relief ahead. Related Reading: SUI Rally At Risk? Analysts Warn Of 30% Dip If This Level Doesn’t Hold SUI Gathers Momentum Ahead Of Showdown With Resistance In an X post on June 7, Pillows shares a positive insight into the SUI market despite a sustained downtrend throughout May and early June. The analyst notes that SUI appears to hit local bottom within the $2.8-$3.0 following a slight rebound in the past 48 hours. Interestingly, this recent price action could signal market reversal especially considering the formation of a bullish descending wedge pattern on the SUI daily chart. For context, the descending wedge is a classic bullish reversal pattern marked by two converging trend lines sloping downward as seen in the chart below. The price action within the wedge which typically consists of lower highs and lower lows but the decreasing slope of the lows signal a weakening bearish pressure. Considering the rebound from the $2.8 which represents the lower boundary of the descending wedge and the narrowing of both trend lines, Pillows postulates SUI is preparing for a major upside price breakout. However, the altcoin must overcome a crucial resistance at $3.5 price level which represents the upper boundary of the descending wedge pattern. Pillows explains that a successful daily price close above $3.5 is likely to trigger a robust buying pressure that could force a SUI market rally for the next 2-3 weeks leading to a new all-time high. Based on the analysis presented, initial price targets are set at $4.00 indicating an instant return to the peak price region in May. However, with Pillows’ analysis hinting at a new all-time high, investors should expect any potential price breakout to hit a minimum price target of $5.21 representing a 60.8% gain on present market prices. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn’t Gone Off Yet — What To Know SUI Price Overview At the time of writing, SUI trades at $3.23 representing a 2.33% gain in the past day. However, weekly and monthly losses of 1.01% and 17.10%, respectively suggests the altcoin still has ground to make up. Nevertheless, SUI remains one of the best performing tokens of the present market cycle with potential star of the altseason considering its 211.11% in the last year.

Judge Victoria Sharp ruled that these generative AI tools could not conduct reliable legal research. Judge Sharp claimed that AI tools could provide seemingly coherent and plausible responses but also be entirely incorrect. She clarified that while lawyers can use AI in their research, they have a professional obligation to check the accuracy of such research by reference to authoritative sources before using it in their professional work. The judge’s remarks came amid rising concerns over instances where lawyers cited what appeared to be AI-generated falsehoods . Dame Sharp’s decision cited two recent cases where lawyers were found to have cited fake cases generated by AI in court proceedings. She said her ruling will be shared with professional bodies in the country, including the Bar Council and the Law Society. Lawyer Hussain cites non-existent cases in $120M case Lawyers, beware: The Dangers of Using AI to Draft Submissions Without Verification In the Al-Haroun case, the court uncovered a staggering 45 citations that were either non-existent or contained inaccurate quotations. Shockingly, these false citations were originally generated… pic.twitter.com/CbgNy1z7X1 — Lawpoint Uganda (@Lawpointuganda) June 7, 2025 Lawyer Abid Hussain cited non-existent cases in a $120 million (£89M) lawsuit regarding an alleged breach of a financing agreement with Qatar National Bank. Hussain submitted a filing with 45 citations, out of which 18 did not exist, while many others did not contain the quotations that were attributed to them. The client, Hamad Al-Haroun, apologized for unintentionally misleading the court with false data from publicly available AI tools and said he was responsible rather than his lawyer, Hussain. But Sharp said it was “extraordinary” that the lawyer relied on the client for the accuracy of their legal research rather than the other way around. Judge Sharp, the president of the King’s bench division, said there were serious implications for the administration of justice and public confidence in the justice system if AI was misused. She added that lawyers misusing AI could face public admonishment and referral to the police. She called on the Bar Council and the Law Society to consider steps to curb the problem “as a matter of urgency.” The judge also asked heads of barristers’ chambers and managing partners of lawyers to ensure all lawyers understood their professional and ethical duties when using AI. “The responses may make confident assertions that are simply untrue. They may cite sources that do not exist. They may purport to quote passages from a genuine source that do not appear in that source.” – Judge Victoria Sharp , President of the King’s Bench Division Ian Jeffery, the Chief Executive of the Law Society of England and Wales, said the ruling laid bare the dangers of using AI in legal work. He added that AI tools were increasingly used to support legal service delivery. Still, the real risk of incorrect outputs produced by generative AI requires lawyers to check, review, and ensure the accuracy of their work. Advocate Forey cites five fake cases in a tenant’s housing claim Barrister Sarah Forey cited five fake cases in a tenant’s housing claim against the London Borough of Haringey. Forey denied using AI , but Sharp said she had not provided the court with a coherent explanation for what happened. The judge also warned that offering false material as genuine might be considered contempt of court or, in “the most egregious cases,” perverting the course of justice. She added that this could lead to severe penalties for lawyers who did not comply with their professional obligations. Sharp said Forey showed a worrying lack of insight, adding that the court did not accept that a lack of access to textbooks or electronic subscription services within chambers, if that was the position, provided anything more than marginal mitigation. She asserted that Forey could have checked the cases she cited by searching the National Archives caselaw website or by going to the law library of her Inn of Court. Sharp observed that Forey must have deliberately included fake citations or used AI despite denying it in her witness statement. Last month, Justice Ritchie said that, in citing five fake cases, the behavior of Forey, then a pupil at 3 Bolt Court, and the lawyers at Haringey Law Centre in London was improper, unreasonable, and negligent. He also ordered all of them to pay wasted costs.

In 2025, that strategy will never be more critical. With significant developments shaking up the digital asset space, the following big winners are emerging fast. Ethereum is regaining institutional favor after BlackRock’s renewed interest in its ecosystem. These aren’t isolated headlines—they’re signals that crypto is charging into a more dynamic, utility-driven era. And right in this thunderstorm of innovation sits a frost-covered rebel: Arctic Pablo Coin. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another token in the meme coin jungle—it’s a full-blown expedition into the world of myth and magic. Each presale isn’t a round; it’s a new destination. Arctic Pablo is currently exploring Location 26—Icicle Heights, where the $APC token is available for just $0.00027. Arctic Pablo Coin: Where Myth Meets Money In a world full of soulless tokens and overhyped gimmicks, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) brings something refreshingly different—a narrative. This isn’t just a meme coin, it’s a movement. Arctic Pablo, our explorer-hero, travels across the globe, uncovering enchanted locations where hidden wealth—$APC—is stashed beneath the ice. This legendary tale wraps a community-driven token in mystery, scarcity, and serious upside. And the best part? Investors get to join Pablo’s journey in real-time. Here’s what makes Arctic Pablo the best crypto to invest in right now. First, no traditional stages—each “stage” is a new location. From the Glacial Gorge to the current Icicle Heights, prices go up every time Pablo moves on. Miss an area, and you’re buying higher. The current price? $0.00027. The expected launch price? $0.008. That means your investment has the potential to grow 28x before it even hits the open market. Imagine grabbing 37,030,000 APC tokens with a $10,000 investment and watching it swell to $296,240 once the coin hits exchanges. These aren’t made-up dreams—they’re math. The tokenomics are structured for sustainability: 50% presale, 25% liquidity, and key allocations for marketing, development, and ecosystem expansion. Most impressively, unsold tokens are burned weekly, permanently shrinking supply. And don’t sleep on the 66% APY staking—those who lock their $APC tokens for two months post-launch will earn huge passive returns. Token burns are logged transparently on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and the contract accepts everything from BNB and ETH to BTC and SOLANA. This isn’t some basic token slapped together overnight—it’s a fully formed ecosystem that invites users into a mythological, wealth-creating experience. With over $2.69 million raised, Arctic Pablo coin’ s expedition is reaching a critical point. Each move closer to the final location means fewer tokens and higher prices. This presale is ending soon, and those still waiting on the sidelines may find themselves priced out when the cold adventure finally heats up. Ethereum: Institutional Revival and Ecosystem Depth Ethereum remains a titan in the crypto world for good reason—it’s not just a coin, it’s a decentralized operating system. With the recent pivot from BlackRock back toward Ethereum and renewed interest in staking through institutional custodians, the Ethereum ecosystem is regaining serious momentum. After the Shanghai upgrade, Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake is now fully functional, allowing ETH holders to earn staking rewards directly while supporting network security. The best crypto to invest in often carries both history and future potential, and Ethereum checks both boxes. It’s at the core of everything from NFTs and DAOs to DeFi protocols that handle billions in volume. Even as gas fees continue to spark debates, the rise of L2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Base are keeping the Ethereum narrative alive and well. Polkadot: Cross-Chain King with Real-World Use Cases Polkadot, designed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, is a different beast. Its interoperability makes it a go-to for developers who want chains to talk to each other without needing centralized bridges. This unique architecture means Polkadot can host multiple chains (called parachains) that operate independently yet communicate efficiently. Polkadot’s strength lies in its tech utility, which gives it serious weight among long-term believers in blockchain. Its on-chain governance allows token holders to vote on critical upgrades, maintaining a truly decentralized ethos. While it doesn’t have the hype of meme coins or the name recognition of Ethereum, Polkadot earns its place among the best cryptos to invest in for its infrastructure and roadmap clarity. Final Thoughts Based on the research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the best crypto to invest in for those hunting explosive returns and narrative-driven engagement. Ethereum offers institutional strength and ecosystem maturity, while Polkadot brings in unmatched cross-chain innovation—but neither delivers the blend of storytelling, price entry, and upside like Arctic Pablo. This current stop at Icicle Heights won’t last long. Each presale location edges closer to the final chapter, and token prices inch upward with it. Arctic Pablo isn’t just exploring the unknown—it’s charting a course straight to crypto’s next breakout moment. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now before prices melt away. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What is Arctic Pablo Coin and why is it unique? Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is a meme coin with a storyline-based presale, where each phase is a new location. It combines narrative excitement with strong tokenomics, burns, and a projected ROI of nearly 2,863%. What makes Arctic Pablo the best crypto to invest in right now? It offers low entry pricing at $0.00027, a deflationary model, staking rewards up to 66% APY, and potential gains of 28x before it lists at $0.008. How does Ethereum compare to Arctic Pablo for investment potential? Ethereum provides stable growth and institutional backing, while Arctic Pablo offers a much higher ROI with a lower entry point, ideal for high-risk, high-reward investors.

In a new interview on PBS’s Amanpour and Company, Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, says that the US government is in a situation where it absolutely must lower its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 7% to 3%. According to Dalio, the government must take a three-step approach to lowering the deficit-to-GDP ratio if it wants to avoid a “very high likelihood of real problems.” “It has to be done with three things, and it has to be spread out among these three things, because any one of those three things would be too painful. Those three things are tax revenue, spending cuts and interest rates. Although Congress and the president in the process does not deal directly with the third of those, right now a trillion dollars – half of our deficit – is interest payments, and not only do we have a trillion dollar interest payment, in the next year, we have nine trillion dollars of debt maturing that has to be either rolled over or sold… So there’s what I call my 3%, three-part solution, which was very similar to 1991-1998. It was cut by 5% of GDP, the budget deficit, in those years was cut by 5% of GDP by spreading it around. So those are the three things that are needed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

BTC is reaffirming their status as the best cryptocurrencies to invest in during this cycle. But as blue-chip coins steady the market, fresh capital is rotating into high-potential, new crypto Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading under $1 and drawing attention for its ambitious DeFi roadmap and projected 44x ROI potential. Over 11,700 investors own the token and has raised funds worth over $10.1 million. A lot of investors are investing at $0.03 since the next increase of 16.67%, to $0.035, is about to happen. Investors joining now are expecting a 100% return once the project goes live at a price of $0.06. MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially for those eyeing the next big cryptocurrency before the next breakout. Bitcoin and Ethereum Maintain Momentum Amid Market Optimism The current price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $105,366 which is slightly higher by 0.02%. Ever since hitting its May low of $93,232, Bitcoin has rebounded and analysts say the $106,000–$106,500 range will act as strong resistance for the cryptocurrency. While writing, Ethereum (ETH) is trading above $2,628.42, adding around 0.52%. The coin is now toughing it out at a critical stage of $2,725, where it has met with challenges while progressing this week. Buying these cryptos right now is considered smart, because they open many opportunities for investors. Crypto investors are now paying more attention to upcoming altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as high-potential investments. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows MUTM utilizes a two-way lending model that has made the project take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,700 investors have invested $10.1 million in the presale pointing to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, Mutuum Finance is an intriguing DeFi project. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum have passed $105,000 and $2,000, respectively, investors believe in their continued growth. Along with this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention after raising over $10.1 million from more than 11,700 participants in its presale. MUTM is currently $0.03 and it is forecasted to go up 16.67% very soon, so buying it now could potentially earn potential investors double their initial investment by purchasing at its initial offering of $0.03. Being able to lend money using a new system and providing a stablecoin makes it attractive in the world of DeFi. Thanks to these early supports and increasing appreciation, MUTM proves itself to be valued as much as BTC and ETH.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $9.84, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.50 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.75 and $17.06, with an average price of $16.41. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

This creates favorable circumstances for the investors, as the cryptocurrency is now gaining value. During the past two trading sessions, XRP surged high, but a few hours back, it observed a rejection at $2.226, a level that the coin seems to be challenging again soon. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP coin confirmed an upward trend for the cryptocurrency. The XRP/USD value has appreciated to a high of $2.216 for the day. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify rising buying activity. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility.

XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of the XRP coin also confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The XRP/USD value has increased to $2.216 in the past few hours. The increasing volatility signals a higher chance of an upcoming reversal or further price escalation. The Bollinger Bands are diverging, leading to increasing volatility. This uptick in volatility signifies a higher market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.231, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $2.113, securing the support. XRP /USD 4-hour price chart The RSI indicator is trending within the neutral region for now.

Ripple price analysis gives out a relatively bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has increased to a high of $2.216 over the period of the last 24 hours. The coin has managed to gain up to 1.53 percent of its value. Technical indicators give out sell signals, however, the price charts continue to project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple and the rising adoption might boost XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisition and CBDC development make XRP a good investment option in the long-term. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as strong buying momentum took hold, surging the price to $2.216 during the day. The RSI increased to 47.57 at the same time and is now in the neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.28 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $17.06 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has released plans to launch an XRP-focused treasury strategy. VivoPower has secured $121 million in private share placement for the strategy, which will make it the first publicly traded company to adopt XRP as a primary treasury reserve asset.

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57; however, near the start of June, it is trending around the $2.18 range, as the market sentiment tilts towards the negative side.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-08 11:30:00

While short-term price action appears calm, with the king cryptocurrency locked in a narrow 24-hour range of $103,500 to $105,800, underlying signals hint at seismic moves ahead. And with the asset now 6.2% down from its May 22 all-time high, the crypto community is divided: double top or liftoff? Double Top Déjà Vu? Pseudonymous analyst Cryptowizard took to X on June 7 with a chart comparison between Bitcoin’s current structure and the infamous 2021 double top. “Bitcoin’s price action is starting to look familiar,’” they wrote. “Just like in 2021, we’re seeing a potential double top formation plays out. Are we setting up for a retrace or $150K next?” That question has ignited debate across the community. Investor Trade Pro isn’t buying the bearish narrative. “Make no mistake about these pullbacks. I think they are buying opportunities… All signs point to strong continuation to new all-time highs,” they asserted, citing strong on-chain metrics. Backing that bullish case, Gracy Chen of Bitget says the macro picture is playing directly into Bitcoin’s hands. Trump’s latest 1% rate cut proposal and over $500 billion in expected U.S. Treasury borrowing by Q4 hint at a liquidity tsunami. “Globally, monetary easing is no longer a question of if, but when,” she noted, calling BTC the ultimate hedge in a world increasingly skeptical of fiat stability. “Bitcoin was built for these shifts.” Market watcher Axel Adler Jr. also noted that the 30-day volatility is now “highly compressed,” a setup that could just be the basis for a substantial market swing. Meanwhile, institutional buying continues to lock up supply. Swan CIO Ben Werkman pointed out that allocators, rather than traders, are driving this cycle, accumulating BTC without intent to sell. “62% of Bitcoin hasn’t moved in over a year,” noted Swan, suggesting that historic dormancy often precedes liftoff, as was the case in 2016 and 2020. Resistance Ahead? Still, not everyone is convinced the pump is near. According to Glassnode, at this time, the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis sits at just above $97,000 , with crucial thresholds at $83,200 and $114,800. The blockchain analytics firm predicts that a break below $100,000 could ignite another liquidation cascade, especially after Friday’s $988 million in long liquidations triggered by the very public tiff between U.S. President Donald Trump and his erstwhile political ally, Elon Musk. Even Daan Crypto Trade isn’t ruling out a deeper retracement. “Below yesterday’s lows at ~$100K and I think we’ll keep trending down for another 1–2 weeks,” he posted on X, pointing to BTC’s weakening correlation with stocks and a sluggish bounce from recent lows.

If Bitcoin continues this reversal of sentiment, I expect a move higher and a potential test of prior highs in the near term. A confirmed tweezer bottom would mark strong buyer intervention and a probable shift in market sentiment toward new highs this summer. If $100K fails to hold, the bullish thesis is invalidated; price action this week should confirm whether a sustained reversal is underway. Recent price action in Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) chart appears to show a textbook tweezer bottom. A tweezer bottom is a bullish reversal candlestick pattern that sometimes appears at the end of a downtrend. If this is the case, Bitcoin may be ready to make a reversal and potentially break out to new highs in the near term. For this reason, so long as Bitcoin stays above its June 6th close, and does not breach the apparent bottom it made on June 5th and 6th, Bitcoin appears ready to reverse course, move higher, and test upside resistance in the near term. Tweezer bottoms are characterized by two consecutive candlesticks that share the same low price, or very close to it, where the first is the same, low price. Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics: The tweezer pattern has to form following a clear downtrend, which Bitcoin was in for the last few weeks, since making an all-time high in the second half of May. Recent Bitcoin Candlestick Chart (Finviz, with red notations by Zvi Bar) The tweezer bottom starts with a relatively large bearish candle that would generally indicate a continuation of selling pressure, or possibly a sizable capitulation. That move is immediately followed by a bullish candle that is usually of similar size, but what matters most is that its low point is in line with the prior bearish candle. This indicates that despite initial selling pressure evidenced by the bearish move, buyers stepped in at the same price point and prevented further declines before moving the price higher. These consecutive matching lows are likely to mark a strong level of support that implies sellers attempted to push price lower, and that this push lower was rejected. As a result, a tweezer bottom represents a probable reversal of the recent trend down, and a move higher in the near term. If this most recent action is indeed a tweezer bottom, a change in market sentiment through the next few weeks is probable. 1-Year Bitcoin Candlestick Chart (Finviz with red notes by Zvi Bar) It is apparent that a reasonable level of seller exhaustion occurred. Bitcoin had downward momentum since making a top in the middle of May, and faced downward pressure since failing to break through apparent resistance around $111,000, or around its all-time high. The downward momentum within the first bearish candle of the tweezer bottom then faced significant opposition at just above $100,000, and sellers were unable to push Bitcoin lower. The subsequent bullish candle indicates and/or confirms buyer intervention. Bouncing off the same low demonstrates that buyers consistently and likely aggressively stepped in at that level, absorbing selling pressure and reversing price direction. This indicates a return of buying interest and a potential shift in market sentiment. The matching lows also create a strong level of support that appears likely here to signify a near term price floor from which Bitcoin could jump-start a recovery. The confirmation of whether the move last week was a tweezer bottom comes from the subsequent price action. A sustained move higher after the apparent formation validates a reversal. Similarly, the tweezer bottom’s support should also subsequently act as support on another move downward, and become a critical level where buyers must successfully defend against further price depreciation, or a continuation and potential acceleration of the pre-existing downtrend becomes exceedingly probable. If Bitcoin has, in fact, formed a tweezer bottom, this may represent a significant development for sentiment around Bitcoin and the potential for it to make new highs this summer, and possibly even before summer’s technical start. Risk While this pattern may suggest that a critical low was established as support, and that selling pressure has waned, it is also possible that the level of support created by the apparent tweezer bottom shall not hold. It could be the case that the second candle’s bullish appearance was due to other temporary forces, such as Friday's weekly options expiration or the capricious influences of recent government actions. Other influences would include changes to interest rates, dollar weakness, and general sentiment towards competing safe haven and alternative assets. In either case, it should be expected that market activity this week will confirm whether this is, in fact, a tweezer bottom, and continued upside momentum should be expected, or if this was a temporary respite to be followed by further declines. Conclusion I believe it is highly likely that Bitcoin just made a tweezer bottom that will act as a strong level of support, and it is likely that Bitcoin is at the start of a reversal that will test its prior high. If Bitcoin cannot hold $100K, it would invalidate this theory and indicate continued selling pressure. If Bitcoin confirms the tweezer bottom in the coming days, it is also reasonably likely that Bitcoin can make a new high in the near term, and potentially move considerably higher.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-08 12:00:00

According to reports, the investment platform masquerades as InnBucks Investment, luring innocent people into depositing their funds using Ecocash, which is moved to the fake trading platform. According to local reports, the platform promises residents in Zimbabwe the opportunity to make profits from Bitcoin trading, agreeing to trade the asset on their behalf. They are asked to register accounts on the Amexcyp Market platform using their specialized link. “Here is an opportunity to make x3 of your investment without any hidden fees or withdrawal fees 100% safe and secure. And also have access to your trading account. Send us a message now to start,” one of their advertisement posts reads. Zimbabwe residents lose funds to bogus investment platform According to reports, the platform has other types of advertisements spread across Facebook , targeting unsuspecting residents of the country. “Other platforms may falter, but we remain the best place for safe and secure coins trading in Zimbabwe. Trade on InnBucks investment today!” another post read. However, it was discovered that the platform had no connections to InnBucks, with the platform releasing a post on its Facebook page warning its users. “Stay vigilant, stay safe. Never share your InnBucks PIN, OTP, or ID number with anyone. InnBucks does not carry out Investment schemes, always verify the authenticity of pages through our official channels—call us on 569 or message us on our official social media platforms. Be on the lookout for fake pages and scammers like the ones below,” InnBucks posted, attaching some of the fake platform’s posts. According to investigations carried out by Bulawayo24 , the fake trading platform’s posts have a WhatsApp number attached, with the number belonging to an agent called Michelle Chiunda, claiming she is from InnBucks Investment on Facebook. The attached number only connects through WhatsApp and a call is always received by a party that is oblivious to either the trading investment platform or its WhatsApp account. Upon enquiry, “Chiunda” mentioned that the WhatsApp number was registered in her sister’s name, claiming the name, Katanda, which was attached to the number, is also her surname. Meanwhile, upon calling the number, it was answered by a woman who seemed unaware that her number was being used to lure people into InnBucks Investment on Facebook, pointing to the fact that the number might have been hacked. Fake investment officer reveals operations Confirming the advertisement made on Facebook, Chiunda mentioned that if a client in Zimbabwe invests $100 on the platform, the company will take charge of the trading on their behalf using their auto-electronic mining machine. This machine is 100% guaranteed for locking all incoming profit, it also keeps the trade signal stable to prevent any negative effect from MARKET-CAP,” she said. She added that the trade takes 24 hours to complete, and once it is done, the user is guaranteed X10 of their investment, while the company keeps the remaining X3 part of the profit. Chiunda said that users in Zimbabwe can receive their profit from any account, highlighting that they pay to Ecocash, Innbucks, or Mukuru. She mentioned that as soon as a user signifies their intention to invest, a link is sent to them where they can register. For a user in Zimbabwe to register on the trading platform, they must send their details to Chiunda to help them register or click on the amexcypmarket link that she sends to them. After registration, the user is expected to send a screenshot of the interface to her before they proceed with their initial investment starting from $50. She also claimed that the platform is in association with InnBucks, a party that has already distanced itself from the scam, and indicated that the authorities have been alerted.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $105,550 on Sunday, June 8, up by 5% from its lowest point last week. It remains 5.75% below its highest point this year. Bitcoin has wavered recently because of investor profit-taking . In May, its price surged to a record high of $111,900, a 50% surge from the lowest level in April. BTC also wavered as data pointed to outflows from exchange-traded funds. SoSoValue data shows that these ETFs shed $128 million last week after shedding $157 million a week earlier. It was the first back-to-back weekly outflows since April. Further data shows that sentiment among crypto investors has turned neutral this month. The closely-watched fear and greed index has dropped to the neutral point of 56. Bitcoin has also wavered after reports emerged that China was considering selling its seized coins. Data shows that it holds 190,000 coins worth over $20 billion.

It has fallen from over 3.5 million in 2020. Bitcoin supply on exchanges | Source: Santiment Second, more companies are intensifying their Bitcoin purchases. Strategy is raising over $2 billion more to buy Bitcoin , while Trump Media has filed to raise up to $12 billion for purchases. Other firms like MetaPlanet and The Blockchain Group are intensifying their purchases. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The other Bitcoin catalyst is its solid technicals. The daily chart shows that it has slowly formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is completing the handle section. Bitcoin has also remained above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which provide substantial support. It has also remained above the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back in the coming weeks. The initial target is the cup’s upper side at $109,477. After moving above the all-time high of $111,900, it may surge to $150,000.

The idea, first sparked by crypto trader Vladcoin, is now being seen as a real possibility by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas. He believes there’s a strong chance we could see this unique fund by 2026. ETF Analyst Sees a Real Chance In response to Vladcoin’s idea of having an ETF that buys and sells meme coins based on how well they perform, buying the promising ones and selling off the weaker ones. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said there’s a “really good chance” that an actively managed meme coin ETF could exist in the future. However, he added that it would probably take some time to happen. Really good chance this exists at some point. First we’ll get slew of active crypto ETFs (eta Winter 2025). Active meme coin-only likely 2026 tho. The return dispersion (and lack of sell side coverage) ripe for active. Could produce next star manager. Who knows. https://t.co/9CcEc4xmev — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 7, 2025 He expects to see many active crypto ETFs launch by winter 2025, but a meme coin-only active ETF is more likely to come around 2026. Meanwhile, polygon-based prediction market Polymarket predicts that Dogecoin ETF will see approval by the end of 2025 with a probability of 44% . No Meme Coin ETFs Yet While we don’t have a meme coin-only ETF yet, the idea isn’t completely out of the blue. Several big asset managers have already launched or filed for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck. These funds have been very popular, bringing in billions of dollars in assets within months. Some smaller players have also filed for “crypto basket” ETFs that invest in a mix of digital assets, but so far, no one has filed for a meme coin-only ETF. Still, the idea is gaining interest. Why Meme Coins? Eric believes that meme coins could be perfect for active management. Meme coins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and Pepe are known for their huge price swings and hype-driven moves. Many don’t have traditional research or clear fundamentals, which makes it hard to know which ones will survive. Eric also hinted that if this kind of ETF comes to life, it could create a new star in the investing world.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-08 12:25:51

U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga in Alexandria, Virginia, partially denied Capital One’s motion to dismiss the proposed class action, reports Reuters . The suit focuses on Capital One Shopping, a free browser extension designed to search for online coupons, better prices and rewards at over 100,000 online retailers. But the plaintiffs say Capital One stole from bloggers, influencers, and YouTubers by overriding their tracking codes and diverting affiliate marketing commissions from creators during the checkout process. They accuse Capital One of unjust enrichment, interfering with their contracts, and violating the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Judge Trenga ruled that plaintiffs Jesika Brodiski and Peter Hayward plausibly argued that Capital One should have known that it was diverting payments by overriding web cookies containing data on commissions. Capital One denies the allegations. “Capital One Shopping does not replace affiliate marketer cookies or unlawfully take credit for commissions. We disagree with the allegations in the complaint and look forward to defending ourselves in court.” Capital One was also recently accused of misleading clients by not telling them about higher-yielding 360 Performance Savings accounts, allegedly preventing customers from accessing better interest rates, keeping their 360 Savings account rates as low as 0.3%.

ChatGPT Answers,https://cryptopotato.com/how-high-can-ripples-xrp-price-go-in-h2-2025-chatgpt-answers/,"TL;DR The popular AI solution outlined several possible scenarios for XRP’s price trajectory heading into the second half of the year, with the most bullish ones forecasting a surge to double-digit territory. Some of the possible catalysts for such mindblowing price pumps include overall market performance and the potential approval of a spot XRP ETF. XRP to $10 in H2? Being the centerpiece of a highly vocal community, Ripple’s native token is frequently the subject of massive price predictions even long before its late 2024 breakout that resulted in a surge from $0.6 to $3.4 within months. Although it has lost a lot of steam since then and has been stuck in a consolidation phase for a month now, the XRP army keeps spitting out some ambitious targets for this year. With H2 of 2025 just around the corner, we decided to ask ChatGPT about its take on how XRP could perform by the end of the year. The AI solution was not short of (bullish) words, indicating that a breakout beyond the crucial resistance at $2.62 can result in an immediate jump back to $3. From there, the asset’s trajectory north seems clear as long as it manages to rise past the 2018 all-time high of $3.4. Recall that this level was almost matched in January 2025, but the subsequent market correction halted XRP’s momentum, and it has been unable to recapture it ever since. ChatGPT cited several crypto analysts who asserted that Ripple’s token could enter uncharted territory, reaching above $10 and potentially up to $15, if the US SEC greenlights an XRP ETF and the financial products experience sizeable inflows. The agency has delayed making a decision on several applications, but the odds on Polymarket are quite favorable by the end of the year. “In H2 2025, XRP could realistically rise to $3–$5, assuming positive catalysts like ETFs and technical breakouts play out. Hitting $10 or more would require a full-blown bull cycle with multiple strong tailwinds,” concluded the AI bot. Challenges Despite the overall bullish perspective, ChatGPT noted that there are certain challenges investors have to consider before blindly allocating funds to XRP (or any other asset, for that matter). In the case of the ever-volatile crypto market, these include global economic uncertainty and overall sentiment, as both factors can impact all assets. The AI chatbot also mentioned a few factors that can influence XRP’s price, in particular, such as more ETF delays or a lack of progress in terms of Ripple partnerships and network adoption. Additionally, investors should be aware that a price tag of $10 per XRP would result in a market capitalization of well over $500 billion. It’s not as if this is an impossible number to reach, but it would mean that XRP will be larger than ETH, at least according to today’s numbers.

The broader market remains cautious, with Bitcoin price hovering around the mid-$105,000s as traders assess resistance just under $106,000. While bullish momentum remains intact on higher timeframes, key indicators hint at consolidation risks heading into June 10. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The Bitcoin price action has seen a decisive rebound from the $102,000 region, recovering over 3% in just two sessions. This move followed a bounce from the confluence of dynamic support around the 100-EMA and horizontal demand near $101,000. However, the 4-hour chart shows that price is once again stalling near a significant resistance block between $105,800 and $106,900—an area that coincides with the upper Bollinger Band and previous rejection zones from late May.

Grinex’s massive transactions occurred despite being the suspected successor of the sanctioned Russian platform Garantex, blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger reports. Garantex Reportedly Rebrands as Grinex Alarm bells have been raised after Grinex, the rebrand of Garantex, reportedly moved over $1.2 billion in USDT through crypto exchanges. According to blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger , Grinex’s incoming and outgoing transaction volumes have exceeded $1.2 billion in USDT within weeks of its launch. Following a global law enforcement effort in March 2025, the notorious Russian exchange platform Garantex was dismantled. Garantex was one of the most prolific platforms on which illicit cryptocurrency operations took place. Global Ledger that Grinex emerged as Garatex’s likely replacement after the crackdown. The Fall of Garantex On March 6, 2025, a large-scale global law enforcement seized Garantex’s primary domain. The Russian exchange has a long history of alleged involvement in illicit crypto transactions, leading to sanctions by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in April 2022. In February 2025, the UK followed suit, sanctioning Garantex and six associated crypto addresses. According to Global Ledger's findings, Garantex continued its involvement in illicit operations. “Since its designation by OFAC on April 5, 2022, Garantex has been responsible for over USD 100 billion worth of transfers, accounting for over 70% of volume to and from sanctioned entities and jurisdictions during that time. The exchange has continued to facilitate hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit transactions for criminal actors, sanctioned entities, and individuals.” Garantex was most recently associated with eight crypto wallets linked with Houthi military operations. Grinex’s Operations An investigation by Global Ledger reveals that significant funds have moved between Grinex and numerous licensed exchanges. Many of these licensed exchanges enforce AML and KYC standards, raising concerns about compliance risks. In its publishing, Global Ledger detailed: “As of May 23, inbound and outbound USDT (Tron) transactions have surpassed $1.2 billion each. These aren’t speculative wallet movements or isolated whale trades. The volume represents a complex web of high-frequency inflows and outflows, much of it tied to major exchanges that are supposed to “flag” this kind of activity.” Correction: Research and findings are attributed to an investigation conducted by Global Ledger.

SUI Underwhelming Performance in Q1 Messari revealed that SUI’s circulating market cap fell 40.3% to $7.2 billion, which is far steeper than the crypto market’s overall 18.2% dip during the same period. Despite this, Sui climbed two spots to become the 13th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. On the other hand, Sui’s network fees, which comprise gas fees from transaction execution, including computation and non-refundable storage costs, fell sharply in the first quarter of 2025. Total fees dropped 33.3% quarter-over-quarter to $3.6 million, or 1.0 million SUI. While the 40.3% decline in SUI’s market price contributed to the drop in fee revenue when measured in dollars, the 44.4% decline in fees denominated in SUI suggests that reduced on-chain activity and lower user demand also played a significant role in the overall decrease. Validator payouts were directly impacted by the slowdown. DeFi and NFT Activity on Sui Beyond DeFi, NFT activity remained strong on Sui. Total NFT trading volume reached 13.2 million SUI since the mainnet launch. Leading platforms such as Clutchy, TradePort, and BlueMove drove marketplace traction. Additionally, collections such as Fuddies and SuiFrens: Bullsharks and Capys dominated trading. During the same period, Sui also saw institutional engagement ramp up notably. Grayscale’s addition of SUI to its Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund in January marked a turning point, which signaled validation from a top digital asset manager. By February, Libre Capital launched its Libre Gateway on Sui, which allowed tokenized access to hedge fund strategies, including offerings from Brevan Howard and BlackRock. In March, World Liberty Financial announced its decision to partner with Sui. This was followed by yet another notable regulatory development in the same month, when Canary Capital filed for the first US-based SUI ETF. Meanwhile, Sui’s strong decentralized exchange momentum has faced significant headwinds in Q2 following a major exploit on Cetus Protocol. On May 22nd, a $223 million attack compromised Cetus’ Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) pools, significantly disrupting trading activity. While the protocol has pledged full user compensation, supported by its treasury and a strategic loan from the Sui Foundation, the recovery depends on an on-chain community vote to unlock $162 million in frozen assets.

Eventually, this important meeting was scheduled for 6 June, later rescheduled for June 9 at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. However, the title for the event is “D efi and the American Spirit ,” drawing lots of attention from Wall Street leaders, crypto developers, and the public. DeFi: The Hot Topic on Everyone’s Mind Decentralized Finance, or DeFi , has been growing fast. People love the idea of financial tools that don’t rely on big banks or other middlemen. But as more people jump in, questions about rules and safety have also grown. That’s why the SEC is bringing everyone together to figure out how to move forward. The SEC says this meeting is part of its mission to understand how DeFi works and to decide if new rules are needed. Topics will include how smart contracts work, who controls tokens, and how automated systems can keep things fair for everyone. Open Chat with Developers and Experts Commissioner Hester Peirce, who’s leading this panel, said she wants honest talks. “We’re here to learn,” she explained in a recent briefing. She thinks that by listening to developers and the people using these systems, the SEC can find ways to protect investors without slowing down progress. At the meeting, experts will also look at how real-world assets like watches or art can be turned into digital pieces and traded on the blockchain. Big Names Of Panealist The roundtable will feature panelists from Wall Street DBA, Jito Labs, MetaLeX, Coin Center, etc. Psticaicaptes inclined Michael Jordan, Co-founder of DBA, Rebecca Rettig, CLO of Jito Labs, Gabriel Shapiro, CEO of MetaLeX, Peter Van Valkenburg,h Director of Coin Center, and many more.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-08 13:12:20

This grassroots adoption underscores the growing role of crypto in everyday commerce. Meanwhile, analysts are eyeing Tether’s booming financials—$13 billion in 2024 profits and a projected $515 billion valuation if it went public. Despite speculation from industry figures like Anthony Pompliano, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissed the need for an initial public offering, signaling confidence in the company’s private structure and expanding influence. He described it as a “quietly revolutionary shift” that shows how Tether ( USDT ) has been integrated into daily commerce.

This means that the company could surpass household names like Costco and Coca-Cola. Ma’s analysis points to Tether’s reported $13 billion in net profits for 2024, with $7 billion derived from Treasury securities and repos. At the same time, an additional $5 billion came from unrealized gains on Bitcoin and gold reserves. Tether valuation at 515B is a beautiful number.

Responding to the valuation estimate, Ardoino called the $515 billion figure “beautiful” and also suggested it might be “bearish” considering Tether’s expanding Bitcoin and gold treasury holdings.

This bullish outlook comes as SOL recovers from a dip on June 6, when it touched the weekly low of $141. As of press time, the token was trading at $149.52, down 1.5% over the past 24 hours. SOL one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Solana is facing short-term bearish pressure, with the price lingering below the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $161 and the 200-day SMA at $164.19. A decisive break above the 200-day SMA could confirm a trend reversal and ignite renewed bullish momentum. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) is 40.14, indicating mild bearish pressure without entering oversold territory. SOL’s path to $620 From a technical standpoint, analyst Master Ananda shared a TradingView post on June 6 outlining a potential path for SOL to reach $620, with a minimum target of $420 and an extended high of $1,020. After a roughly 24% correction from $188 to $141, Ananda believes the pullback phase may be over. In this case, the cryptocurrency is developing a higher low pattern, which suggests the start of a new upward trend. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, key Fibonacci extension levels support this projection: $420 at the 1.618 level, $620 at the 2.618 level, and $1,021 at the 4.618 level. According to the forecast, the digital asset could hit the $620 mark by January 2026, a 316% increase from its current price. If this target is reached, Solana’s market cap could balloon to approximately $325 billion, potentially ranking it second behind Bitcoin ( BTC ), assuming minimal growth from Ethereum ( ETH ) during the same period. Finally, the trading expert cautioned against shorting during a bullish trend, advising instead to wait for support levels before entering long positions. Solana fundamentals Meanwhile, Solana’s broader ecosystem continues to show notable momentum. Market attention is focused on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision regarding spot SOL exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) applications. The odds of approval in 2025 have surged to over 80% despite the SEC delaying its decision on proposals from 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital. On the flip side, some skepticism remains. Banking giant Standard Chartered questioned Solana’s long-term sustainability in late May, warning in a report that the network risks becoming a “one-trick pony” dominated by memecoin creation and trading. For starters, Solana’s recent momentum was driven mainly by meme coin activity on the network.

The mode is still relatively under wraps but features two names recognized by Hitman gamers: Stone and Knight. IO Interactive revealed that the co-op mode for Hitman: World of Assassination, called Stone & Knight, will allow two players to control agents Stone and Knight to tackle missions together. On this co-op mode’s release, players will be able to pop into “exciting missions” from the Hitman world with their friends by their side. These missions will “challenge” players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. IO CEO Hakan Abrak said Agent 47 continues to “resonate” with audiences worldwide, proving the franchise’s enduring appeal as it approaches its 25th anniversary. He added that everyone at IOI extended sincere thanks to the global community of players, and they look forward to delivering many more hours of stealth, creativity, and signature assassinations in the years to come. Elverdam confirms the return of Stone and Knight Agents Stone and Knight in the new Hitman co-op. Source: IO Interactive During the IOI presentation, IO Interactive’s Chief Creative Officer Christian Elverdam said that the developer wanted players to team up with a friend and enjoy Hitman in co-op. A quick pop over to the game’s fan wiki revealed that Stone and Knight were both playable characters in the Hitman 2: Sniper Assassin game mode and the Hitman Sniper: The Shadows mobile game. They worked together in both games, so they were a natural fit to bring over to a full-on Hitman co-op mode. There are no details on how the mode would work at this point, nor is there a teaser or anything that could be shared. However, a few seconds of gameplay visible while Elverdam was talking revealed picture-in-picture action: One character in the foreground, the other in a smaller window in the bottom left. Specific mechanics are unclear as it is early in development, but it may involve splitting tasks like distracting guards or eliminating targets, building on past modes like Sniper Assassin. “So two new playable characters, Stone and Knight, return from their appearance in our sniper co-op mode to a full-blown Hitman co-op experience…We invite you to play a set of exciting missions across our World of Assassination and challenge you to re-think your approach now that you’re going to play as a duo.” – Christian Elverdam , Chief Creative Officer at IO Interactive Fans were excited, but some worried about balancing the upcoming co-op duo with the game’s solo stealth focus. Both characters traded in their sniper rifles for silenced pistols and had the option of disguising themselves. Elverdamn said it is still early days and added that more news about the new mode will be shared soon. In addition to this little nugget, IO announced that Hitman : World of Assassination had reached the milestone of 25 million units sold. The developer added that the game had registered 80 million players, which took into account players from World of Assassination and its Free Starter Pack. IO unveils Le Chiffre from Casino Royale as an elusive target Developer IO Interactive also announced that Hitman is currently being updated to include a new elusive target – Le Chiffre from Casino Royale. The news was revealed on June 6, with actor Mads Mikkelsen joining Geoff Keighley and IO boss Hakan Abrak to announce the Hitman x Bond collaboration. Mikkelsen said Le Chiffre is a character he always enjoyed because he is calculating, cold, and ruthless. He added that bringing Le Chiffre into the world of Hitman made for a thrilling collaboration. Players can expect mind games, high stakes, and twists that only this character could orchestrate. To succeed, Mikkelsen said they would need to play their hand wisely. IO’s Hakan Abrak also said the team is beyond thrilled to welcome Mikkelsen to Hitman: World of Assassination. He added that players are really going to enjoy this new mission, which marks the return of Le Chiffre after nearly 20 years. Abrak also said he is excited to see players jump into this small taste of bigger things to come in the Bond franchise from IO Interactive. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 866,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows that BTC demand is significantly outpacing supply, resulting to higher prices. The trader says he seeing “insatiable” demand for Bitcoin from firms in the traditional finance (TradFi) world, leading him to believe that bullish continuation is on the table for BTC. “Demand > supply A picture is worth 1,000 words Feel like we see around $120,000 this month.” Source: Pentoshi/X The analyst also tells his followers to remain patient and have a long-term outlook on the crypto king. “Everyday: ‘If there’s billions of dollars flowing into BTC, why is it not going up?’ My brother in Christ, Zoom out. It’s going to get there, just maybe not always at the speed you want.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,536. Looking at the broader crypto market, Pentoshi says a new bubble is forming in the space. “Looks like all the money is going to be made in crypto companies doing IPOs (initial public offering) at wild valuations Deeper pockets, more liquidity, higher valuations Another bubble is brewing, another bubble to chase.” Pentoshi’s bubble call comes after shares of the stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) meteorically rose on the first day of trading. Circle debuted on the stock market on Thursday with an opening price of $69 per share, a massive increase from the IPO value of $31.00 per share. As of Friday’s close, CRCL is worth $107.70.

MUTM could be the best crypto to buy today,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/08/looking-for-big-gains-mutm-could-be-the-best-crypto-to-buy-today/,"The crypto industry continues to make waves, changing the way assets and digital finance are viewed. One of the best inventions from the crypto sector is decentralized finance. However, DeFi projects have struggled to find their footing until Mutuum Finance (MUTM) came along. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is being hailed for its technical innovation that will transform DeFi forever. Let us take a deep dive into this unique project. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) value proposition Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit assets in a liquidity pool, governed by a smart contract, and earn interest. The interest rate is determined by the pool’s utilization rate, which is a measure of the capital that is actively being borrowed as a measure of the total in the pool. When pool utilization is high, the interest rate rises, which pushes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rate. Meanwhile, it encourages more lenders to join the pool to benefit from the high interest rate. These actions boost the liquidity in the pool, which lowers the rate. It leads to a self-balancing feedback loop for optimal capital efficiency. The mtTokens One of the unique aspects of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is mtTokens. When a user deposits $3,000 worth of BNB in a pool, for instance, they receive mtBNB tokens on a 1:1 ratio. The tokens represent the value of the deposit in the pool, plus any accrued interest. The tokens accumulate value in real time, based on the amount of interest an asset earns in a pool. Since mtTokens are compliant with the ERC20 token standard, they can be traded on secondary exchanges, allowing holders to take advantage of market opportunities in real time. At any time, you can deposit the mtTokens back into the pool to redeem their original asset plus any interest accrued. This process streamlines the user experience, ensuring users do not need to actively claim or compound their gains. It also promotes transparency and ensures non-custodial ownership. The tokens can also be used as collateral across Mutuum Finance’s numerous lending scenarios. Security on Mutuum Finance The Mutuum Finance team places a premium on security. As such, they have taken numerous measures that are designed to protect the ecosystem’s security. Address screening One of the security measures in place on Mutuum Finance is address screening, which is done using a third-party service. The screening ensures that addresses that have previously been involved in nefarious activities do not make their way onto the platform. Such addresses include those involved in fraud or other prohibited actions. Once flagged, those addresses will be kept from accessing the front-end of the platform, helping to keep everyone safe. When a user tries to connect to Mutuum Finance, their address is first sent to a proxy endpoint and then forwarded to the screening service. However, privacy is maintained at the highest level, and IP addresses and metadata are not sent, except for the address itself. By screening addresses, it allows Mutuum Finance to comply with relevant laws. This will ensure that the platform is not restricted, making it possible for as many people as possible to benefit from its unique design. Bug bounty program Mutuum Finance will implement a bug bounty program that will help to strengthen the long-term security of the protocol. It will incentivize developers, security experts, and researchers to go through the code and identify any vulnerabilities before they impact users. The bounty program covers smart contracts, libraries, and off-chain services that have a direct impact on the functionality of the protocol. The Muuum Finance (MUTM) presale Mutuum Finance is currently in the presale phase, where it has enjoyed massive success. Driven by investors for long-term profitability opportunities, over $10.1 million has been raised so far. Over 11,700 unique buyers are participating in the presale, which is currently in phase 5. Tokens in phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. This stepped price increase started in phase 1, when the price was $0.01. It is meant to reward early supporters with bigger gains. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, over 25% of the presale tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely a week after they launched. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting Defi project that has caught the attention of the masses. The current momentum in the presale phase is expected to be sustained until the token listing, when tokens will launch at $0.06. Do not miss the opportunity to make a 100% guaranteed ROI at the current price of $0.03. This is an opportunity you could live to regret missing.

This trend shows the importance of functionality in crypto investments. At the center of this debate is which utility token will give the best returns and long term growth. Is Ripple (XRP) with its established presence and focus on cross border payments the safer choice? Or is Ruvi AI (RUVI) the smarter bet? Ripple (XRP): A Leader in Cross Border Payments Ripple’s XRP is one of the oldest utility tokens. Since 2012 XRP has been focused on speed, cost and efficiency of cross border payments. Unlike traditional payment systems that take days to settle and have multiple intermediaries, Ripple’s blockchain allows for near instant international transactions with minimal cost. Ripple’s growing list of partnerships with financial institutions has solidified its position in the blockchain space. Major companies, banks and payment providers have adopted Ripple’s technology to streamline their operations. Despite legal issues in the past (regulatory disputes) Ripple has maintained a loyal user base and is delivering on its utility promises. But with more competition in the blockchain space XRP must now contend with new players that are offering innovative solutions to industry wide problems. One such player is Ruvi AI (RUVI). Ruvi AI (RUVI): A Disruptor in Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI is going to revolutionize the crypto space by merging blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). It’s a decentralized superapp where users can produce AI generated content in text, audio, video and image formats. This combination of blockchain security with AI automation makes Ruvi AI a solution for industries from marketing to creative production. The $RUVI token integrates seamlessly into this ecosystem, powering platform transactions and offering staking rewards and governance rights. Beyond speculation Ruvi AI delivers real world applications, making it a utility token with huge growth potential. Ruvi AI’s Presale Ruvi AI has been gaining momentum and the presale has been performing exceptionally well. During Phase 1 which was launched at $0.010 the offering sold out in 2 weeks. Phase 2 was launched at $0.015 and to date over 1,400 holders have invested in Ruvi AI showing strong confidence in the project.The project has also locked in its first exchange listing and partnered with a major trading platform to increase liquidity and accessibility for early backers. More announcements are coming in the next few weeks and the presale has already raised $1.5 million. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI offers investors different tiers to maximize returns during the presale. These tiers offer bonus tokens based on the level of investment. Here’s what the returns look like based on the initial listing price of $0.07 and the predicted $1 price target post-listing: VIP 2 Threshold: 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus: 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens: 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price: $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch: $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold: 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus: 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens: 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price: $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch: $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold: 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus: 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens: 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price: $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch: $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). Why RUVI? Analysts are choosing Ruvi AI not just for presale but for its inherent value as an industry disruptor. Unlike tokens that rely on community support or speculative price behavior $RUVI is integrated into a functional ecosystem for long term utility. Its development roadmap is transparent and focused on real world applications from automating workflows to marketing innovation. Also Ruvi AI’s decentralized governance model gives the users a voice in key decisions. Conclusion Ripple (XRP) is a utility token for those in the financial systems and cross border transactions space. But Ruvi AI (RUVI) is the new kid on the block with innovative tech, active development and growing user base. Analysts are saying big gains and early backers are already making money from the presale. Ruvi AI might be the better bet for forward thinkers.

Amidst some level of renewed stability in the last two days, popular analytics firm Glassnode has now shared an important on-chain analysis highlighting the presently key price levels in the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? Bitcoin Ready For Breakout As Traders Eye $114K And $83K Levels In an X post on June 7, Glassnode provides an insight on potential Bitcoin price action using the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis model, derived from the Work of Cost (WOC) price framework. As the name implies, the STH cost basis represents the average purchased price of all coins belonging to short-term holders i.e. investors who acquired their Bitcoin within the last 155 days. The STH cost basis is an important market metric as it reflects the risk appetite of newer market participants who are typically the most reactive to price change. It is also a strong indicator of market sentiment with an ability to act as resistance or support depending on the price direction. According to the data by Glassnode, the current Bitcoin STH cost basis is estimated at $97,100. Using standard deviation bands in this WOC model, Glassnode has further identified the $114,800 price level as the +1STD level of this cost basis and a potentially heated market zone. Considering Bitcoin’s price, this $114,800 price zone represents the next major resistance, a break above which is expected to trigger a massive buying pressure and push the premier cryptocurrency further into uncharted price territory. Glassnode’s WOC model also identifies the -1STD level at $83,200 to represent a critical support zone in the present bullish structure. A decisive price fall below this level would signal market weakness and is likely to cause a cascade of liquidations and further price corrections. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says This Bitcoin Top Signal Hasn’t Gone Off Yet — What To Know Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105,745 reflecting a 1.07% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 34.27% and valued at $38.66 billion. Provided Bitcoin continues to consolidate above the STH cost basis at $97,100, there is a valid chance for a market bullish push towards resistance at $114,800. However, a loss of the critical support at $97,100 would points to a retest at $83,200 which holds strong potential bearish consequences.

Meanwhile, PI Coin Falters and DOGE Trend Explodes",https://thecoinrise.com/unstaked-ignites-massive-buying-frenzy-as-presale-reaches-9-2m-meanwhile-pi-coin-falters-and-doge-trend-explodes/,"The crypto space is buzzing again, and three names are pulling in all the attention: Dogecoin, Pi Network, and Unstaked. In a week of wild moves, Unstaked has surged past $9.2 million raised in presale and is rapidly approaching the $10 million line. With its unique AI-backed DeFi model, a $1 million rewards campaign, and increasing demand, Unstaked is gaining recognition as the best long term crypto you don’t want to miss in 2025. At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is flirting with a breakout pattern that’s capturing traders’ imaginations, while Pi (PI) continues to spiral down, raising alarms among holders and analysts alike. Dogecoin Trend Sparks Buzz as Bullish Pattern Sets the Stage Dogecoin (DOGE) is back on the radar, and this time, momentum might be real. The coin is hovering near $0.2245, but technical traders are watching closely. A bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern is forming on the 1-hour chart, and with a neckline around $0.228, a confirmed breakout could send DOGE racing to $0.239 or even $0.25. Adding fuel to the fire? On-chain data shows that nearly 78% of DOGE holders are in profit, ranking it just behind Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink. While that does raise short-term sell-off concerns, it also reflects a strong price foundation and long-term interest. Traders are watching volume closely. If DOGE gets the right push, the current Dogecoin trend analysis could signal a broader meme coin rally, and nobody wants to be left behind when that rocket launches. Pi Crash Alert Deepens as Sentiment Cracks and Price Dips Meanwhile, Pi Coin (PI) is sounding serious alarm bells. After slipping to around $0.67892, the fear of a crash is growing louder. Analysts now warn that the price could tumble all the way to $0.40 if key issues like transparency and developer communication remain unresolved. Bearish technicals are stacking up. The MACD shows a downward crossover, Bollinger Bands are squeezing tight, and volume is drying up. The Pi (PI) crash alert has turned into a major point of concern among holders, many of whom are split between calling the dip a buying opportunity and raising red flags over centralization concerns. The Fear & Greed Index has plunged to zero, signaling peak caution. Without a major announcement or development roadmap from the Pi Core Team, the risk of deeper declines continues to grow. For many, the time to look elsewhere is now, and Unstaked is catching their attention. Unstaked’s $9.2M Presale Surge Signals It’s the Best Long Term Crypto to Grab While PI struggles and DOGE teases a breakout, Unstaked is stealing the show. Already past $9.2 million in stage 19 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011065, the project is lighting up every serious crypto radar. Its rise isn’t driven by luck, it’s the result of strong fundamentals, powerful tech, and a clear roadmap that puts community and innovation first. The platform runs on its unique Proof of Intelligence model, where users are rewarded based on real, AI-verified contributions, not just passive holding. It’s a system that values action and quality, rewarding real participation and creating long-term sustainability. Unstaked also prioritizes transparency. No private allocations, a fully open smart contract, and live public presale tracking are in place to foster trust. Add in decentralized governance that puts control in the hands of token holders, and you’ve got one of the most attractive offerings in the DeFi space. The FOMO doesn’t stop there. The $1,000,000 Unstaked competition is turning heads. Over five months, 20 winners will each claim $50,000 in $UNSD tokens. To qualify? Complete a few easy tasks, refer friends, share posts, and make a $100 minimum token purchase. It’s a win-win: participants get rewarded, and the community keeps expanding. With utility, transparency, governance, and real traction, Unstaked is being talked about not just as another presale, but as the best long term crypto with real staying power. Unstaked’s Climb Proves the Future Is Being Built Now As crypto markets zigzag through bullish setups and sudden selloffs, one thing is clear: not every project is built to last. Pi Coin’s crash alert highlights the risks of stagnation, while DOGE’s exciting technicals could mean a rally is near, but only Unstaked is proving it can lead with real momentum and substance. With more than $9.2 million already secured, and its AI-powered, community-driven infrastructure catching fire, Unstaked is charging ahead while others hesitate. The presale is gaining pace, the ecosystem is expanding, and the opportunity window may not stay open for long. If you’re searching for the best long term crypto with vision, growth, and early access potential, Unstaked is the name to remember. Don’t let this one pass you by.

Its ability to leverage its position as an entertainment producer through crypto and NFT also makes it a ""GameStop of Korea"", in my opinion. The $500 million raise injects some much needed working capital, while simultaneously lifting the stock price. This improves the risk profile of the stock going forward. Traders and risk-tolerant investors should consider KWM to be among the top tier of opportunities within the wave of small caps looking to crypto strategies to reinvigorate their stagnant stocks. K Wave Media Ltd. ( KWM ) is a recent de-SPAC that stumbled out of the gate since the business combination about a month ago. It became the first South Korean content media alliance to list on the NASDAQ with a controlling interest in six entertainment operating subsidiaries in the country. The stock got a significant shot in the arm when it announced a $500 million equity purchase facility to support a Bitcoin Treasury Facility. It aims to become the ""Metaplanet of Korea”. Metaplanet Inc. ( OTC:MTPLF ) is Japan's best performing and most liquid stock , up over 2,500% over the last 12 months. Not bad for a hotel management company. KWM rose 133% from $1.92 to $4.48 immediately following the news on Wednesday, but traded as high as $6.47 that day. A pullback since then can be seen as a buying opportunity for traders and risk-tolerant speculative investors who might have missed the initial run. What makes KWM stand out from other fly-by-night penny stocks looking to reinvigorate their dying stock prices by adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies is that KWM actually has an existing business it can leverage and amplify through the use of Bitcoin. In my opinion this is not an attempt at a bandwagon jumping pump, but an actual workable business model. Data by YCharts KWM's business model is ideally positioned for a Bitcoin Treasury Facility While KWM wants to compare itself to Metaplanet, I think calling it a sort of ""GameStop of Korea"" is equally as apt. Two months ago I wrote an article on GameStop ( GME ), defending the bull case of leveraging its popularity and cash balance into a crypto play. While GME is an entertainment retailer and KWM is a producer of entertainment content, the way they can integrate crypto into their brands and existing operations puts them a step ahead of other companies jumping on the bandwagon. Not only is KWM looking to create a buy and hold yield strategy like Metaplanet or Strategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), but it also intends to enable its customers to purchase content and K-pop merchandising utilizing Bitcoin in a Web3 environment. Investors could also invest in South Korean film and K-pop projects utilizing Bitcoin or other coins approved by the company. In my article on GME, I mentioned how the company created its own NFT marketplace, but shut it down last year. Presumably because it wasn't a success. The difference between GME and KWM is that KWM's subsidiaries are the owners and producers of the content, rather than merely being resellers. Crypto and NFTs are natural extensions of traditional sales channels for entertainment by the producers of said content, with built in ways to prove authenticity and protect intellectual property. Examples include movie and concert ticket management and distribution of movies and music. Celebrity-backed memecoins are still attracting capital investment, which proves that artists can monetize their popularity, often on thin air. KWM has now opened itself to this world, with the difference being that its content creators can offer something of substance and value to their fans through their coins. This is simple fan club type of activities, but investors in North America may already be familiar with the massive and rabid fan bases of entertainers coming from South Korea. The ""BTS Army"" being one example of that. As big of a phenomenon ""stonk"" and ""apes"" have become in the retail end of Wall Street, with GME being the lead example, these movements pale in comparison to Korean pop star followings. In my opinion, KWM is on the right track trying to marry crypto and South Korean pop star trends, with a unique ability to monetize it all. But just like any other company out there, it has its own set of challenges. Operations, financials and risks KWM, through its holding subsidiary K Enter, own six operating subsidiaries: a Korean IP merchandising company that mostly sells K-pop items named Play Company, three movie production companies in LAMP, Bidangil, and Apeitda, Anseilen, a K drama production company and Solaire Partners, a Korean IP content-specialized private equity firm. On a pro forma basis, these subsidiaries generated a total of $59 million in revenue in 2024. Of that, Play generated $32 million, Bidangil $14 million and LAMP $12 million of revenue, respectively. That revenue generated $4 million in gross profit and an operating loss of $18 million. Total net loss - inclusive of $52 million in transaction costs - was $73 million. On a pro forma basis, KWM had $9 million in cash with a working capital deficit of $25 million at the end of 2024. Total equity was $116 million with $160 million of its assets being in the form of goodwill or intangibles. While the tangible net assets being negative should be a cause for concern, it would make sense that the bulk of a movie and entertainment producer's assets are in the form of intangibles. The operating loss combined with the working capital deficit implies an immediate need for financing. The 6-K filing related to the $500 million equity purchase facility states that in addition to using the proceeds to support the Bitcoin-centric digital asset treasury strategy, the company will also be using it for working capital and M&A activities, further expanding its content and K-pop related businesses. The company was smart to turn the need to raise significant funds to support its business and related downward pressure on a stock in this type of situation into a bullish catalyst backed by Bitcoin mania. One of the prime motivating factors of KWM consolidating these businesses and going public in the first place was to boost its capital and bargaining power against global over-the-top media platforms such as Netflix ( NFLX ). Taking a look at KWM's thin gross margins and investors can understand why this would be a goal. Netflix shouldn't make more money on Korean productions than the content creators themselves. Starting a Bitcoin strategy is a great way to increase KWM's market visibility and leverage it into improved financial performance of its primary business. The major risk of the Bitcoin treasury announcement outside of negative price action on Bitcoin is that we have no details on the terms of the $500 million financing. It'll be impossible to assess the potential from a fundamental perspective until we know the valuation of the raise. KWM trades at a little over $200 million market cap, so this financing is going to substantially dilute the stock. Investors who are interested in this opportunity are going to have to accept the risk of being unable to properly value the upside of this Bitcoin strategy until more information is provided. Conclusion: Speculative Strong Buy To call KWM a speculative strong buy is a bit of a misnomer. ""Speculative"" buy in my world usually implies there are a lot of risks to the thesis and therefore should be considered a weaker buy than normal. In contrast, a ""strong"" buy refers to a stock with a very favorable risk to reward profile, likely with a high floor with a thesis that is based primarily on fundamentals. I view KWM as an exception to this rule. The Bitcoin Treasury model is in the early stages and there are too many unknowns from a fundamental and operating perspective to not consider this situation speculative in nature.

The flagship cryptocurrency had plunged to an intraday low of $100,421 late on Thursday before rebounding on Friday and reclaiming $105,000 on Saturday. BTC has been marginally up over the past 25 hours, trading around $105,695. Analysts are optimistic that the price will stabilize above $105,000 and push higher. Public Companies Turning To Bitcoin (BTC) As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, many public companies are adding the asset to their treasuries. Companies like Strategy and Metaplanet have gone all-in on the flagship cryptocurrency, using it as a hedge against inflation, rising interest rates, and fiat debasement. However, critics have accused these companies of using Bitcoin as a speculative lifeline rather than a strategic asset. According to a report by BitBo, over 70 public companies hold Bitcoin as of June 6, with companies like Strategy and Metaplanet effectively acting as proxies for the asset. However, several companies are also strategically investing in the asset while continuing to focus on their primary business. Analyst and journalist Sean Williams has raised concerns about the potential failure of companies building Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting a lack of innovation and operational success as drivers of a potential collapse. The analyst also called the Bitcoin treasury hype a “dumpster fire in the making.” The analyst highlighted that many companies pivoting to Bitcoin were not profitable in the first place, suggesting their efforts were to make a quick profit from crypto volatility. He also highlighted several instances when the Bitcoin price saw substantial declines as a potential risk for the company. However, supporters believe corporate Bitcoin treasuries are grounded in strong macroeconomic reasons. Fidelity pointed out that companies are using Bitcoin treasuries as a successful hedge against inflation, fiscal deficits, and currency debasement. Bitcoin Liquidation Risk Rises Bitcoin (BTC) regained the $105,000 level over the weekend, recovering from Thursday’s sudden collapse that saw the price drop to a low of $100,421. The recent price action could inspire traders to bet on the price continuing its upward trajectory. An analysis from Rekt Capital stated, “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support earlier today. Daily Closing & retesting ~$106600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Another analyst looked at order book liquidity to gauge price direction, summarizing that BTC’s liquidation cluster is signaling an upward move. “BTC liquidation cluster is now signaling an upside move. If BTC pumps 10% from here, $15.11 billion in shorts will get liquidated. Meanwhile, a 10% downside move will liquidate $9.58 billion in longs.” The analyst also predicted a move past $109,000-$110,000 for BTC next week. Other market watchers predicted a retest of the $100,000 support level, with popular trader CrypNeuvo stating, “100k is the strongest psychological support so, as explained on Sunday, it's the area where I'm building some longs with easy invalidation below it.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is painting an inverse cup and handle pattern, with its neckline near $100,500 acting as support. A breakdown below this level could trigger a drop to $91,000, aligning with BTC’s 200-day EMA. To regain control, Bitcoin bulls must ensure the price remains above $105,000. A breakdown of current levels could significantly impact BTC’s chances of hitting $150,000 by the end of the year. However, BTC’s weekly chart is flashing a warning, indicating the formation of a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI, a pattern last seen during the 2021 cycle top, when the RSI trended lower despite higher price highs. That divergence gave way to a 61% correction. Analysts believe a similar structure is visible, with a divergence below $112,000 on the weekly chart. BTC traded in the red most of last week, registering a marginal decline on Tuesday before falling 1.03% on Wednesday and settling at $107,834. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and almost 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. Source: TradingView The price fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and move to $105,903. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as BTC fell 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell below $105,000 and settled at $104,755. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, falling to a low of $100,421 before ultimately settling at $101,615. The price recovered on Friday, rising almost 3% to recoup its losses and settle at $104,378. BTC continued pushing higher on Saturday, rising over 1% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,575. The current session sees the price marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers have pushed the price past $106,000 during the ongoing session.

But he declined to elaborate on what those “consequences” would be. Trump later reiterated his words, saying, “There will be very serious consequences.” Trump also made it clear that he has no desire to repair his relationship with Musk: “I have no intention of repairing my relationship with him.” When asked if his relationship with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was over, he replied, “I assume so.” The tension between Trump and Musk, which came to the fore at the beginning of the week with mutual threats and accusations on social media platforms X and Truth Social, has reached a new level with these statements by the President. Trump argued that the Republican Party has become more united than ever before following the tension. Related News: The UK May Be Joining the US in Embracing Cryptocurrency - New Step Forward Trump, who stated that he had no plans to meet with Musk in the short term, said, “I am busy with other things,” and added: “I do not plan on talking to him.” He also accused Musk of disrespecting the office of the presidency: “This is a very bad thing. He has great disrespect for the office of the presidency.” In response to calls from some conservative figures that Musk's business dealings and immigration record should be investigated at the federal level, he said: “That's not on my agenda right now.” Trump also said he did not believe Musk's opposition to the budget bill, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” jeopardized its future: “I'm confident it will pass the Senate before July 4th. The Republican Party has never been more united.” Elon Musk, who has given Trump major financial support in the 2024 elections, has donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to the campaign in critical states. In the early months of the Trump administration, Musk was appointed head of the “Department of Government Efficiency” and implemented comprehensive government downsizing policies. *This is not investment advice.

However, crypto has not yet achieved its full potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to change all that. Based on its current performance in the presale and other metrics, this project could explode in 2025. Let us take a closer look at this powerful project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – a project ready to explode Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been slowly building up momentum in 2025. So far, investors with a keen eye have already made a dive into the project and look forward to massive gains. For instance, it already has over 20k loyal followers across different social media channels. Additionally, its presale has been a massive success, raising over $10.1 million. Over 11,700 unique buyers are participating in this fast-paced presale, which is in phase 5. Phase 5 tokens are selling for $0.03, which is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67%. That will reduce the guaranteed ROI based on the $0.06 listing price to 71.43% from the current 100%. It is one of the main reasons why the pace has been so fast in this phase of the presale. So far, over 25% of the tokens have been sold, barely a week after it began. Mutuum Finance giveaway spurs buying spree Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently unveiled a $100,000 giveaway , which has boosted interest in the presale to dizzying heights. Participants in the presale have a chance to be one of the ten lucky winners who will receive a $10,000 reward in MUTM tokens. To take part in this exciting giveaway, all you need is a $50 investment in the ongoing presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – the future of DeFi The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as borrowers, lenders, or liquidators. As a lender, you will deposit funds into one of the audited smart contracts on the protocol. You will then start earning interest on those assets, at a rate determined by the pool’s utilization rate. On top of receiving interest, depositors also receive mtTokens, which grant them instant liquidity. For instance, when you deposit $2,500 worth of ETH, you will receive mtETH tokens on a 1:1 ratio. These tokens can be redeemed at any time for the value of your assets, plus any interest accrued. The use of mtTokens simplifies the process for users, as they no longer have to claim or compound their assets manually; instead, they can monitor the value of their mtTokens rise on-chain and redeem them when they are ready. The mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, which means holders can transfer these assets on compatible secondary exchanges. This will allow them to take advantage of new market opportunities in real time, even as their assets gain value in the liquidity pools. How Mutuum Finance maintains protocol solvency One of the main challenges of new DeFi projects is to attract enough liquidity. Mutuum Finance has come up with an elegant system of incentives that will keep liquidity streaming in. For instance, they will purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to stakers participating in the safety module. The main impact of that will be to attract more stakers, which will help to increase liquidity on Mutuum Finance. Additionally, the purchases will boost the value of MUTM tokens, which will boost interest in the protocol, attracting even more liquidity. Mutuum Finance also plans to use the protocol’s profits to deepen the liquidity pool and for marketing purposes. All these actions will collectively help to grow the protocol and could make it one of the biggest protocols in terms of total value locked (TVL). Security on Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance recently passed a CertiK audit, which has been a major confidence boost for investors. All those previously on the sidelines are not taking every opportunity they get to exit other coins and join this budding project. With analysts predicting a 10x price increase in just the first few days, serious investors are leaving nothing to chance. You too can be part of this promising future by signing up for the ongoing MUTM token presale. At the current price of $0.03, it is an opportunity to grow your investment 10x or more by joining a project at the ground floor. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the same feeling that early Bitcoin (BTC) had when they saw the price grow from $1 to over $100k today.

After a staggering 355% rally from its April lows, the token has stalled, with on-chain data pointing to slowing user adoption and diminished whale interest. While the protocol’s fundamentals appear strong, technical indicators such as a bearish double-top pattern and weakening network activity suggest that SYRUP’s recent momentum may wane. At last check Sunday, Maple ( SYRUP ) price was trading at $0.40 — a few points below this month’s high of $0.4637. On-chain data shows that SYRUP’s network growth has plunged. It moved from 1,085 on May 9 to 37 today. This metric looks at the number of new accounts created each day. More data reveals that the daily active addresses have dropped from 285 on May 9 to 422. These numbers mean that the SYRUP token is not growing as it did in May, when it surged. SYRUP on-chain metrics | Source: Santiment Meanwhile, whales are also not buying the coin. Addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million SYRUP tokens now hold about 384 million, down from last week’s high of 395 million. Similarly, those holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens hold 228 million tokens, while those with between 100 million and 1 billion tokens have 458 million coins, down from 803 million in March.

SYRUP price technical analysis Maple price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows that the SYRUP token peaked at $0.4595 in May, forming a double-top pattern with a neckline at $0.3184. A double-top is a common bearish reversal pattern. Maple Finance’s Relative Strength Index has formed a bearish divergence pattern. As its price rose, this divergence took the form of a downward channel. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the neckline at $0.3184, its lowest point on May 31, and 22% below the current level.

The deceptive pop-up message claimed the 73 year-old woman’s device was infected, including a fake Apple Care phone number for her to call, reports Columbus County News. When she dialed the number, scammers posing as Apple Care representatives said her computer and bank accounts were compromised. They then pretended to transfer her to Wells Fargo’s fraud department. Over several days, the criminals convinced the victim that fraudulent transactions were pending on her accounts. Following their instructions, she withdrew $61,000 in four transactions and converted it to Bitcoin, enabling the scammers to con her out of the funds. When the scammers claimed they had identified a suspect in Texas and instructed her to meet at a local police department to sign paperwork and recover her funds, the victim became suspicious and report the incident to the local sheriff’s office, which is investigating the case and issued a statement. “Citizens are reminded to remain vigilant when receiving unsolicited messages or calls requesting financial transactions and to verify any such claims directly with official service providers.” To avoid falling prey to impostor scams, the FTC advises people to avoid sharing personal or financial information in response to unsolicited requests and be cautious of urgent demands or unusual payment methods like gift cards or crypto.

His comments come amid rising anticipation for a new decentralized exchange (DEX) being developed by Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, one that promises to shield large traders from front-running and liquidation risks. Wynn wrote in his post that he hasn’t been paid a single cent by Hyperliquid. He stated, “I reached out on two occasions hoping to get some kind of partnership deal for all of the attention I was bringing them, and although they seemed thankful, they don’t offer such deals to anyone.” Though Wynn acknowledges Hyperliquid’s decentralized nature may explain its lack of traditional sponsorship structures, his frustration was clear. Despite generating high traffic and trading volume for the platform, Wynn claims to have made only $34,000 through referrals, an amount he describes as “extremely poor” given the scale of his influence. Wynn also criticized Hyperliquid’s referral program stating that the program sucks. He went on to state that other platforms have far better referral programs The liquidations that possibly sparked the outburst Wynn’s comments follow major and publicly chronicled liquidations on the Hyperliquid DEX. In one of the largest capitulations in late May, his massive long position, reportedly worth over $1.1 billion in Bitcoin, was liquidated to the tune of $100 million in full view of the market after Bitcoin fell below $105,000. The visibility of his open position raised suspicions that he may have been “hunted” by other traders who took advantage of the transparent order book, a controversial feature in decentralized finance. The incident sparked debate across crypto Twitter, leading to questions about the current DEX designs and how they expose large traders to manipulation. Wynn’s post seemed to echo the pain of that event and pointed squarely to what he sees as the solution: a new kind of DEX that keeps large trades private. CZ’s dark pool DEX enters the mix Wynn’s warning to Hyperliquid comes just as CZ, the founder of Binance, is preparing to launch a new “dark pool” Perpetuals DEX. According to CZ, this new platform will allow users to deposit assets on-chain but place orders privately, a model designed to prevent front-running, MEV (miner extractable value), and liquidation attacks. CZ stated in his post on X , “If you are looking to purchase $1 billion worth of tokens, you generally wouldn’t want others to notice your order until it’s completed.” While details remain scarce, the project is already being touted as a potential game-changer for DeFi. Wynn expects CZ to win unless Hyperliquid ‘levels up’ In his critique, Wynn clarified that he sees CZ’s entry into the DEX market as a serious threat to current players. “When CZ launches a dark pool perps DEX, it will put an end to HyperLiquid,” he warned. “CZ has the money, network, and teams to build something like no other. Look at what he’s done with Binance.” While this may seem like an endorsement of CZ’s new venture, it’s also a call to arms for Hyperliquid, a signal that the platform must improve not only its incentive structure but also its technical architecture if it wants to retain its user base. Wynn stated, “I hope this encourages HyperLiquid to level up… as they’ll soon be outweighed by better competition.” Hyperliquid has a strong lead in the perpetual DEX market. Source: Coinmarketcap For now, Hyperliquid remains the runaway leader in the perpetual DEX market, maintaining an almost upward-only trajectory since it launched.

Why Some Analysts Believe Ozak AI’s $0.005 Price Could Deliver Higher ROI,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/ethereum-to-10k-by-2025-why-some-analysts-believe-ozak-ais-0005-price-could-deliver-higher-roi,"Ethereum’s journey closer to the $10,000 mark by 2025 has grown to be a famous narrative amongst crypto lovers and analysts alike. As the main smart agreement platform powering the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, Ethereum holds a commanding role in the blockchain space. Its upcoming enhancements, inclusive of the total rollout of Ethereum 2.0 with proof-of-stake consensus, scalability enhancements, and decreased gas charges, are fueling optimism for substantial price appreciation over the next couple of years. However, amid this bullish outlook on Ethereum, a new player in the crypto area is attracting attention for potentially handing over even higher returns: Ozak AI. Currently in its 4th presale section at an access rate of just $0.005. Ozak AI combines artificial intelligence improvements with blockchain generation, providing buyers a unique, early-level possibility to capitalize on the burgeoning AI-crypto convergence. Ethereum’s Strong Fundamentals and Growth Potential Ethereum’s strength lies in its vast adoption and ecosystem maturity. It hosts heaps of dApps and stays the primary platform for DeFi protocols and NFTs, sectors that retain to amplify swiftly. The transition to Ethereum 2.0 pursuits to deal with scalability bottlenecks via moving from power-in depth proof-of-paintings to a greater sustainable and quicker evidence-of-stake model. This improvement ought to dramatically enhance transaction speeds and decrease prices, making Ethereum more available and appealing. With these improvements, many analysts forecast Ethereum’s price could reach or even surpass $10,000 by 2025. This trajectory would represent significant growth from its current levels, driven by increased network activity, institutional interest, and wider blockchain adoption. For many, Ethereum is seen as a relatively safer investment with solid fundamentals, making it a core asset in any crypto portfolio. Ozak AI’s Disruptive Promise at $0.005 While Ethereum specializes in improving blockchain infrastructure, Ozak AI targets a specific frontier by way of integrating AI competencies at once into the blockchain surroundings. Its cutting-edge presale fee of $0.005 gives investors access at a very early stage, with the subsequent presale degree anticipated at $0.01, signaling a potential doubling in price quickly. Ozak AI’s platform aims to leverage AI-driven analytics, decentralized device mastering, and smart automation to create more intelligent decentralized applications. This fusion of AI and blockchain ought to free up efficiencies and novel use cases, attracting developers and customers within the rapidly evolving Web3 space The presale’ s success, having raised over $1 million already, indicates growing investor self belief in Ozak AI’s vision and generation. For buyers willing to take on higher chances for potentially oversized returns, Ozak AI presents a compelling possibility. If Ozak AI reaches its ambitious target charge of $1, early buyers may want to see profits of as much as 200x, a way outstripping Ethereum’s predicted increase price. Comparing Risks and Rewards Ethereum’s path to $10,000 is built on solid, tested technology and widespread use but with a comparatively higher price entry, which means returns, though substantial, may be steadier and less explosive. Ozak AI, in contrast, is in its infancy, and its future depends on successful development, adoption, and market conditions. While the upside is huge, the risks are equally significant. Investors seeking growth potential may view Ozak AI as an exciting high-risk, high-reward prospect, while those valuing stability might prefer Ethereum’s established ecosystem and more predictable trajectory. Ethereum’s anticipated upward rise to $10,000 by 2025 underscores its importance as a foundational blockchain platform with wide programs. Meanwhile, Ozak AI’s $zero.Half presale fee and progressive AI integration present an attractive opportunity for investors eyeing explosive returns in the next crypto bull run. Both tokens encompass unique investment philosophies: Ethereum as a pillar of blockchain growth, and Ozak AI as a disruptive newcomer poised for speedy enlargement.

The firm is the parent company of the social media platform Truth Social. This decision has sent ripples through the finance and crypto worlds, with many seeing it as a step to show confidence in crypto growth. The investment will comprise $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in convertible bonds. This investment is poised to be announced at the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. TMTG joins a growing list of public companies that are looking to diversify into digital assets. However, some see this as a conflict of interest given the latest stance on crypto by the Trump administration. A Strategic Shift into Crypto TMTG has initially indicated that it would be launching its own crypto services called Truth.Fi. This was to be a financial service and FinTech brand aimed at integrating digital assets and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into its portfolio. The firm has already partnered with Crypto.com with an aim to develop ETFs that are focused on Bitcoin and other digital assets. The firm aims to be one of the serious contenders in the crypto economy. With the $3 billion rise in investments, the company will raise its capacity to acquire substantial crypto holdings. This follows the strategy of MicroStrategy, which has so far amassed over $62 billion in Bitcoin through various equity and debt issuances. Growing Interest in Cryptos The company is eyeing the potential growth in cryptos across several markets around the world. Bitcoin and other cryptos have seen a resurgence in interest, with merchants, top-rated crypto casino list options such as those on Casino.Guide, and casual users on the internet using them for their daily transactions. There has also been rising pro-crypto sentiment with the Trump administration. In fact, Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are expected to speak at the Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas, a move that will amplify its visibility. Other high-profile names like David Sacks, the administration’s unofficial ‘crypto czar,’ will be at the event. The firm will be looking to enhance its profile among the serious contenders in the crypto world. The Trump Administration is Crypto-friendly The Trump administration has been the catalyst for big cryptocurrency moves by companies across the country. The president was once a skeptic that called Bitcoin a scam. However, he changed his stance during his 2024 campaign and is promising to create a national cryptocurrency stockpile. The stance toward cryptocurrency has also changed. For example, he made an executive order to establish a crypto working group to enhance the growth of crypto in the country. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been withdrawing investigations into major crypto firms, something that has fostered a conducive environment for investments. There is a growing list of corporations that are holding cryptocurrencies as treasury assets. Companies like Enlivex Therapeutics and Acurx Pharmaceuticals have recently allocated portions of their cash reserves to Bitcoin. Many are viewing it as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Since the current landscape is filled with fiscal concerns and geopolitical risks, this playbook provides a shift from traditional assets. Risks and Controversies The company’s plans have attracted scrutiny from government ethics and regulatory authorities, particularly due to its ties to President Trump and his family. Additionally, TMTG’s aggressive push into crypto comes at a time when the industry remains vulnerable to hacks and volatility. In 2024, cryptocurrency platforms lost $2.2 billion to hacks . One of the decentralized finances (DeFi) platforms, Dough Finance, which was linked to TMTG, was susceptible. This firm collapsed after the hack, and there have been ongoing lawsuits alleging fraud. TMTG has also had a rather rough financial standing in the recent past. It reported a $19 million loss in the third quarter of 2024. This was driven by legal fees and costs tied to its streaming platform, Truth+ Streaming. The firm has a valuation of about $6 billion as of May 2025 but seeks to issue shares at market price, something that could dilute investor confidence. Effect on the Market Following the announcement, TMTG’s stock surged 4.64% to $25.72 following the news. Bitcoin itself saw a 1.5% gain, which is the largest growth in four days. This is a signal of the market optimism towards the firm’s entry into the space. The prospects of the crypto market growing are very real, with many predicting that it will remain bullish into the foreseeable future. However, there has not been regulatory clarity despite the positive posture by the government. When this is in place, we expect better returns on crypto investments.

Recent violent attacks on crypto holders have triggered new personal security measures in the industry. Crypto executives are increasingly hiring private security. A wave of violent kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency holders is pushing some of the industry’s most well-known figures to overhaul their security — including Didi Taihuttu, patriarch of the so-called “Bitcoin Family.” Taihuttu, who famously sold everything in 2017 to go all-in on Bitcoin, revealed that his family has abandoned hardware wallets and now hides their crypto seed phrases across four continents. The shift follows a string of threats and rising attacks on crypto holders worldwide. Even at Gunpoint Attackers Would Get Little “We have changed everything,” Taihuttu told CNBC from Thailand . “Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can’t give them more than what’s on my phone wallet — and that’s not much.” Over the past eight months, the family moved to a hybrid system: seed phrases are encrypted, split, and stored in both physical and digital formats. Some parts are etched onto fireproof steel plates hidden across four continents. Others are stored via blockchain-based encryption services. “You only need to remember which words you changed,” Taihuttu explained. The system ensures that even if attackers access part of the seed phrase, they cannot unlock the family’s full holdings. The decision comes as physical attacks on crypto holders increase. Moroccan police this week arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials. Three British men kidnapped a UK crypto trader in Spain Demanding a €30K ransom. The victim managed to call a friend, who alerted the police Leading to a dramatic rescue. (5/9) pic.twitter.com/8B7OqwnIta — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) May 13, 2025 The Taihuttus, who remain entirely unbanked and travel full-time with their three daughters, say they are rethinking even their public presence. After strangers tracked their residence through YouTube videos, they stopped posting travel updates and moved homes. “We got a little bit famous in a niche market — but that niche is becoming a big market now,” Taihuttu said, noting the family has decided to avoid traveling to France altogether. About 65% of their crypto is now locked in cold storage across four continents. The rest remains in multi-signature wallets or decentralized exchanges for trading and daily spending. Taihuttu said they avoid centralized vaults and services, preferring to retain full control. “What happens if one of those companies goes bankrupt? You’re putting your capital back in someone else’s hands,” he said. Crypto Executives Hire Bodyguards As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnapping. The rise in inquiries came a after spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnappings attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement.

SOL has already posted double-digit gains over the last few weeks, and it is now predicted by experts to follow a strong path to the $1,000 mark by Q4 2025. With its extremely fast blockchain, rising developer adoption, and expanding DeFi ecosystem, Solana is still one of the best cryptos to invest in. But while SOL is making headlines, investors are stealthily piling into a fresh DeFi crypto token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which some say has the potential to deliver next big crypto gains of as much as 34x by year-end. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 11,700 buyers are out there along with a total raise of $10.1 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is sold at launch for $0.06. For those wondering what cryptocurrency to invest in now, both SOL and this new altcoin are positioning themselves to lead the pack. Solana’s Journey to $1,000 Remains on Table Despite June Decline The value of Solana (SOL) is now $156.26 and it has fallen a bit throughout the day though experts are certain that it will rise in the long term. A lot of people generally recommend SOL investment due to its quick transactions and growth of its developer base that makes it stand ahead among the altcoin community. Sometimes, SOL’s price is trapped in near-term resistance zones, however, the chances of SOL reaching $1,000 in late 2025 are still there because its meme coin and DeFi ecosystems keep growing. Crypto investors looking to benefit from the next giant leap are now targeting Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens that have a huge potential to go even higher. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Strong Traction The Presale Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance is attracting investors since many believe in the strong model for the long term different from the rapidly passing fads popular in meme coins. Due to its usefulness and expansion Mutuum Finance is being noticed more in DeFi. So far 11,700 people have invested over $10.1 million which makes Mutuum worth following. Anyone considering an early investment could check Phase 5 tokens which are being offered today for about $0.03. Improving Communities by Providing Attractive Incentives Helpful new features and outstanding rewards are being given to the Mutuum Finance community. The top 50 MUTM holders are shown on the leaderboard and they are set to receive extra tokens as a reward. 10 individuals from the project’s community have a chance to win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as there is a $100,000 giveaway too. New Era in Decentralization Mutuum Finance is famed for the way it combines different lending systems to give users stronger control and flexibility. Those who engage in P2C lending put their stablecoins into pools controlled by smart contracts. People who use P2P lending can decide the terms with the lender rather than only having those terms set by the protocol itself. People gain privacy control of their money and more autonomy which matches the main values of DeFi. Analyst predictions show SOL will reach $1,000 by Q4 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on the other hand has surpassed $10 million in collected funds in presale and attracted 11,700 unique token holders.

With Musk and Trump publicly losing patience with one another, the staff affiliated with their joint initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency, are left to brace for a broad range of impending repercussions. DOGE on the chopping block of the Trump-Musk feud U.S. President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s fallout has put the high-profile federal reform effort at the Department of Government Efficiency, previously led by Musk, in danger. DOGE-affiliated staffers are currently grappling with what they’re calling “collateral damage” from the very public feud between Musk and Trump. According to sources close to the matter, the DOGE employees were caught off guard by how quickly the Trump-Musk spat got out of hand. The staff were reportedly up late Thursday, texting themselves as the feud escalated. Many of them shared fears of being laid off or having the project quietly shelved. The White House has so far maintained that DOGE’s achievements are “undisputed,” but the staff worries that the loss of Musk may signal the beginning of the end. “I worry with Elon gone, no one will join, and it will just slowly fade away,” Sahil Lavingia, a former Department of Government Efficiency software engineer who was embedded at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said. “Working at DOGE felt like pushing a boulder up a mountain, and it’ll just fall back down if the work doesn’t continue.” Much of the agency’s success had been tied to Musk’s private-sector influence and the enthusiasm he brought from Silicon Valley. Many DOGE employees were recruited from Musk’s companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and the Boring Company. With Musk’s departure, they now face a chasm in leadership . Steve Davis, DOGE’s de facto chief of operations, has also exited the project. Recently, Anthony Armstrong, another Musk ally who joined him, also left the initiative. His April departure was confirmed by the Office of Personnel Management. No room to straddle the fence DOGE’s backers in Congress, many of whom were initially aligned with Musk, are now being forced to choose sides. Several Republican lawmakers remain publicly committed to the DOGE mission, although their tone fails to reflect that. “It seems to me Elon thought he was co-president, and everyone except Elon knew that would never happen. Now, his feelings seem hurt.” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) said. “My heart aches,” Rep. Aaron Bean (R., Fla.) told reporters. “You see two friends fighting, and it’s sad that it escalated so quickly.” He expressed hope that reconciliation might be possible and joked that a shared Diet Coke, which is Trump’s drink of choice, might patch things up. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought is working to preserve what remains of the DOGE’s agenda. He is currently conducting a $9.4B rescissions package through Congress. The proposal would lock in $8.3B in foreign aid cuts and other spending reductions attributed to DOGE. Vought said in congressional testimony this week that “cabinet agencies that are in charge of the DOGE consultants that work for them are fundamentally in control of DOGE.” James Fishback, who was an early DOGE advocate and a Florida investment manager, publicly distanced himself from Musk and sided with Trump. “Elon’s behavior is downright disturbing,” Fishback said, urging Musk to apologize. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who has long criticized Musk, also piled on the tech giant this week. On his War Room Live show, Bannon declared the agency a failure. “Musk promised a trillion dollars in cuts in waste, fraud, and abuse,” Bannon said. “We’ve seen barely a fraction of that, and now he’s out. It’s a farce.” Despite the chaos, the Trump administration continues to boast of DOGE’s record. The White House claims the department has saved the federal government $180B through job cuts, canceled contracts, and asset sales. However, independent budget analysts are critical of those figures, arguing that the math behind the savings is opaque and overly optimistic. “There’s a difference between claimed savings and realized savings,” one budget analyst noted anonymously. “We don’t yet know how much of what DOGE did is sustainable.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|DOGE,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-08 15:01:52

The surge led to many flashy headlines, with many newbie investors joining Bitcoin (BTC) near the top. However, seasoned investors know the best entry point into the crypto market is to find projects bursting at the seams with potential like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before they make the headlines. Let us take a closer look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and why analysts are so excited about its future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for huge gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most exciting crypto projects in a long time. It represents shifting investor interest from meme coins to projects that offer long-term value to their community. The project, which is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol, allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As a lender, users have a chance to earn interest on their idle assets by depositing them in a pool. The interest earned is determined by the pool’s utilization rate and can quickly add up based on the asset type and the demand from borrowers. To ensure the long-term solvency of the platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced several notable technical innovations. Thoughtful asset integration process The crypto market is massive, and crypto assets come in all different flavors. Mutuum Finance aims to ensure that users of the platform have the best options possible. In line with this philosophy, the team has a long list of metrics that it uses to determine if an asset should be added to the platform. These checks include: Transaction costs Each asset added to the protocol introduces a new level of code complexity, which pushes up the gas fee. The goal of Mutuum Finance is to strike a balance between offering users as many options as possible while keeping costs as low as possible. Volatility and liquidity Assets with high volatility and low liquidity could potentially impact the solvency of the protocol. To avoid this issue, Mutuum Finance will conduct an in-depth assessment to determine the suitability. Based on the assessment, some tokens may be added in an isolated or restricted model. By vigorously checking tokens and creating specialized frameworks for some tokens, they ensure that users have access to a diverse list of assets while still protecting the protocol’s solvency. Centralization check Mutuum Finance will check whether an asset has issues with centralization before it is added. Assets that are under the control of a single entity could potentially be shut down at a moment’s notice, impacting the overall stability of the protocol. Before adding a token, the team will weigh user demand compared to the overall solvency of the protocol. Oracle manipulation checks The Mutuum Finance project will also add safeguards against oracle manipulation. If a digital asset is found to have an unreliable price oracle, it may be accepted, but with massive restrictions. For instance, it could be placed in non-collateral status. Limiting how such an asset can be used ensures there is a safeguard against exploits that rely on sudden price changes. When an asset is restricted from being used as collateral, its impact on solvency is more limited. The reason for this is that collateral represents the protocol’s assets. As such, those holding the assets must over-collateralize their position to maintain solvency. If an asset is restricted from being used as collateral, the position needs to be excessively backed by high-quality assets. Once assets are accepted on the platform, various metrics will be used to monitor them, such as liquidation thresholds, loan-to-value, and liquidation bonuses. These metrics can be tweaked to ensure that a token does not impact the solvency of the protocol when market dynamics change. MUTM presale performance Based on the technical ingenuity in creating the Mutuum Finance project, the MUTM token presale has attracted overwhelming support. So far, over $10.1 million has been raised. So far, over 11,700 unique buyers have secured their tokens and are looking forward to the listing, when their value could explode 10x or more. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. In Phase 4, the token price was $0.025 and has since increased by 20%. The price is set to increase 16.67% to $0.035. This stepped increase ensures that the earliest supporters will enjoy the greatest benefits. Do not let this opportunity pass you by. With a planned listing price of $0.06, current participants in the Phase 5 presale stand to make a 100% ROI when the tokens are listed. Analysts predict that the price could rise to as high as $2 once the tokens go live.

Table of Contents Ripple expected to soar as whale buys 999,999 XRP Cardano hits new milestone, analyst forecasts uptrend Unilabs Finance: The future of AI-guided crypto investing is now live Best cryptos to buy this June Analysts expect a strong rebound this June across select altcoins, with Ripple, Cardano, and Unilabs topping the watchlist. The Ripple price prediction by analyst 589CTO has sparked optimism among investors. The analyst forecasts the Ripple price could surge to $3.26. Crispy believes the Cardano price could reach $2. Meanwhile, Unilabs could soar to new highs amid growing demand from investors and the rising need for AI-based investment tools.

Ripple expected to soar as whale buys 999,999 XRP The Ripple price is under bearish momentum, mirroring the huge decline in the market. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple price has fallen by 6.2% in the last week. The losses are also visible on the biweekly and monthly charts: 9.9% and 2.4%, respectively. On the other hand, whales are accumulating XRP. Brett, a top crypto expert, revealed that a whale bought over 999,999 XRP recently. 589CTO forecasts the price of Ripple could pump to $2.97 and $3.26. Another analyst, BEN_CRYPTOQ, argues that the Ripple price is about to break through a small convergence. They added that there is an increase in buying force, and a golden cross is appearing. Based on this pattern, CW expects the Ripple price to rise to $4.50. Technically, the relative strength index has dropped below the midline, a sign that the XRP price is under high selling pressure. Currently, the Ripple price has strong support around the 200-SMA ($0.19). Cardano hits new milestone, analyst forecasts uptrend Cardano is currently trading between the 50-SMA ($0.72) and 200-SMA ($0.66) as buyers work to maintain its level. Since breaking $0.70 on May 31st, Cardano’s price has fallen in the past several days. CoinMarketCap data shows the Cardano price has gone down 9.1% in the last week and 1.6% in the past month. Technical analysis indicates the Cardano price is bearish. The Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) flash a sell signal, supporting more Cardano price downtrend. On the other hand, on-chain data shows that the Cardano network has surpassed a total of 110 million transactions. This new record signals high network activity, which could propel the Cardano price up the chart. Crispy said in a recent X post that the Cardano price may rise to $2 by the end of June. Another expert, Crypto Beast says the price of Cardano might soar to $1.5. Unilabs Finance: The future of AI-guided crypto investing is now live Unilabs Finance is setting a new benchmark in the DeFi market by integrating AI into crypto portfolio management.

The premier cryptocurrency climbed above the $105,000 mark in the early hours of Saturday, June 7. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price looks set to continue its upward trajectory over the next few days. What Negative Leveraged Traders’ Sentiment Means For Price In a new post on the X platform, data analytics firm Alphractal shared fresh on-chain insights into the recent movement of the Bitcoin price. According to the market intelligence firm, the major catalyst of BTC’s latest recovery is the sudden shift in the market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Golden Cross Pattern Says The Crash To $100,000 Is Normal – What To Expect Next This on-chain observation is based on the Leveraged Traders’ Sentiment, which tracks the outlook or positioning of leveraged traders in the market. It provides insight into the kind of bets (longs or shorts) that leveraged traders are placing in the crypto market and the funding rates of the derivatives market. Data from Alphractal shows a rising interest in opening short positions in the Bitcoin market, with most retail traders betting on a price decline. Ultimately, this on-chain trend suggests that the sentiment in the Bitcoin derivatives market is currently bearish. However, Alphractal noted that this kind of behavior might not be as straightforward as it looks, as the market historically tends to move in the crowd’s opposite direction. Hence, when several traders are betting on a Bitcoin price decline, the flagship cryptocurrency tends to witness a contrasting market bounce. Alphractal said: When sentiment becomes excessively bullish or bearish, the market tends to do the opposite. Therefore, this metric is not just a sentiment gauge — it’s also a warning signal for potential contrarian moves that often catch traders off guard. According to the analytics firm, this is exactly what is currently happening in the Bitcoin market, with the market leader bouncing back despite the negative traders’ sentiment. Interestingly, if these leveraged traders continue to bet against Bitcoin, the BTC price could potentially ride this fresh bullish momentum to a new all-time high. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $105,700, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Following the latest resurgence, the premier cryptocurrency is now up by more than 1% on the weekly timeframe.

The new plan prioritizes transparency, operational efficiency, and alignment with the blockchain’s long-standing values. The Treasury Strategy In a June 4 blog post , the Foundation outlined plans to allocate 15% of its treasury annually toward operational expenses, while maintaining a financial buffer sufficient to cover two and a half years of spending. Under this model, ETH will only be sold if the liquid reserves dip below this threshold. Reserve levels will be assessed quarterly to determine whether asset sales are necessary, helping preserve treasury strength amid market fluctuations. “We intend to reduce annual opex roughly linearly over the next five years, ending at a long-term 5% baseline that is common for endowment-based organizations,” the post read. It explained that the policy reflects the organization’s belief that 2025-26 is likely to be pivotal for Ethereum, requiring focused investment in key outcomes. “We will frequently reallocate funds between protocols for reasons such as changing market conditions, diversification, or new yield opportunities,” the organization wrote. It emphasized that withdrawals should be understood in that context and not interpreted as anti-endorsements. The non-profit also wants to grow and manage its treasury using secure, permissionless, and audited DeFi protocols. This will include independently staking ETH and lending wrapped ETH (wETH) through established DeFi platforms. Further, it plans to diversify its portfolio periodically by converting some assets into fiat currency. Defipunk Philosophy A new guiding principle, called “Defipunk,” is also a part of the financial strategy. Drawing inspiration from the early cypherpunk movement, this philosophy focuses on the importance of decentralization, financial privacy, and open-source innovation. The new philosophy will serve as decision-making criteria for the organization as it selects projects and collaborations to fund. Financial support will be directed toward teams that share these values, creating a DeFi ecosystem that believes in freedom, anti-censorship, and forward-thinking development. As part of its commitment to transparency, the Ethereum Foundation has also restructured its internal operations. A dedicated finance team will now issue quarterly reports detailing performance, asset distribution, and strategic actions. Annual reports will also provide deeper insight into ETH deployment and fiat-crypto conversions. The non-profit also recently reorganized its internal teams by renaming its research and development unit to “Protocol.” This department will focus on scaling Ethereum’s core infrastructure, expanding blob space, and enhancing the user experience.

According to the analysts, the unique value proposition of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes it a game-changer in the DeFi industry. Here is a breakdown of why there is so much optimism about Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Poised For A Massive Surge Mutuum Finance has been slowly coming into the spotlight throughout 2025. As investors seek out new tokens for massive gains, they are realizing that they cannot get them in large market-cap coins. As such, they are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM which could change DeFi by delivering massive utility. At the core of Mutuum Finance is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders can deposit their funds into one of the pools that are backed by audited smart contracts. In exchange, they receive interest, with the rate set dynamically by the pool’s utilization rate. Borrowers have a choice between stable and variable interest rates. If they pick a stable rate, they get a higher initial rate, which accounts for possible market fluctuations. The stable rate can be rebalanced in some instances. For instance, if the variable rate rises too high, the stable rate might be adjusted to ensure the advantage is not too big. This is done to ensure the stability of the ecosystem. Buy and Distribute Program As part of the effort to ensure the upward growth of MUTM tokens, the team will launch a buy and distribute program when the protocol goes live. In this program, protocol profits will be used to buy MUTM tokens off the open market, which will be distributed to stakers in the safety modules. The action will apply upward pressure on MUTM tokens by reducing supply on the open market. It will also encourage more stakers to deposit funds into the protocol, which will deepen its liquidity. This action will attract more users to the protocol, which will increase protocol profits. Additionally, the purchases on the open market could cause more media attention on MUTM tokens as their value rises. That will also have the positive impact of improving interest in the protocol. Besides buying and distributing tokens, the team also plans to use protocol profits for marketing purposes and expanding pools. Overall, these actions will create a self-sustaining cycle of growth for long-term users of the ecosystem. Recent Updates That Have Excited Analysts Recently, the Mutuum Finance team announced that they plan to launch a beta version of the platform on day one of the token listing. This announcement has excited analysts, who forecast that it could have a massive impact on the token price. According to the most conservative estimates, it could boost the price of MUTM tokens by 1000%. For instance, a $700 investment could turn into $7,000 based on this latest forecast. On the more optimistic end of the forecast, analysts estimate the price could increase by 2,367% a few days after the forecast. All these forecasts are based on the beta version launch. However, there are more recent developments that could push the price even higher. For instance, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team recently published the results of the CertiK audit, which has led to a massive flood of capital into the presale. In the audit, MUTM received a Token Scan Score of 80, which is a massive achievement for a project that is still in the early phases of its presale. The CertiK audit played a crucial role in getting Mutuum Finance listed on CoinMarketCap. The platform is the leading crypto price aggregator, with around 350 million monthly visitors. MUTM tokens now have an opportunity to benefit from improved visibility when they go live, which could provide a massive boost in price, especially with the expected listing on a major crypto exchange. The Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where each token is going for $0.03. So far, over $10.1 million has been raised from over 11,700 investors. The presale has experienced a massive surge in participation recently, with over 25% of the tokens designated for phase 5 already sold, barely a week after it began. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. This increase will diminish the expected ROI based on the planned listing price from 100% to 71.43%. Investors do not plan to wait for this to happen, which has contributed to the current surge in the presale. Another catalyst for the presale is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway, where ten lucky winners who participate in the presale with a minimum of $50 will receive $10k in MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting crypto project that is full of promise and opportunities. Right now, you have a chance to join this exciting ecosystem at the low price of $0.03. Such opportunities are rare in the crypto market, and you should not miss this one.

The case involved his support for the Libra crypto, which suddenly crashed after a quick rise. The Anti-Corruption Office said Milei did not break any ethics rules. Still, criminal investigations and lawsuits are ongoing. OA Investigation Revealed No Violation of Public Ethics Laws In February, President Milei promoted the Libra cryptocurrency on his personal X account, stating that the token would benefit businesses and startups in Argentina. However, the excitement was short-lived. Libra’s value fell by 95%, leading to public anger and big financial losses. Following the crash, President Milei deleted the promotional post, denying his involvement in Libra’s token scandal. However, some opposition politicians asked for Milei’s impeachment. Lawyers filed lawsuits on behalf of investors who suffered major financial losses. President Milei asked the Anti-Corruption Office to investigate his actions in response to the scandal. The OA has now released its findings. The office concluded that Milei’s promotion of Libra was made personally and not as a government action. The president did not involve public funds or official state resources. The OA said the promotional post should be seen as a private message, not an official government action. Dissolution of an Investigation Unit Raised Concerns A government investigation unit working on the case was shut down in May . This came shortly after a federal judge requested access to Milei’s and his sister’s financial records. The president’s office claimed that the unit had completed its work and had passed its findings to the public prosecutor’s office. However, this move raised concerns among critics, who believe the decision may have weakened transparency around the case. They were especially concerned because Milei’s sister had some contact with the creators of Libra , including tech entrepreneur Hayden Davis, adding more complexity to the ongoing inquiries. Libra Creators Faces Legal Trouble Even though the OA cleared President Milei, the creators of the Libra cryptocurrency are still under legal investigation. According to the OA’s report, one of them, Hayden Davis, met with President Milei on January 30. The report says that Davis had no ties to the Argentine government and was introduced by a partner company called KIP Protocol. Two wallets linked to Davis, containing $57.6 million in the stablecoin USDC, were recently frozen by Circle. This followed a court order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Although the administrative investigation has ended, other legal cases are still ongoing. A criminal court in Argentina is still investigating the case. At the same time, a group of investors from Argentina, the United States, and the United Kingdom has filed a class action lawsuit. They are asking for payment for the money they lost after Libra’s crash.

This economic backdrop creates buzz around key digital assets poised for the next surge. Discover which three coins are positioned for a breakout in the upcoming rally. Jupiter (JUP) Price Analysis: Past Decline and Key Levels Jupiter has shown moderate weakness in the past month, reflecting a decline of around 5.58%. The six-month period highlights a more significant drop of approximately 58.55%, indicating a substantial correction from previous highs. Recent data reveals that Jupiter traded within a range from $0.3986 to $0.6539 while testing support close to $0.2726. This prolonged downturn suggests strong selling pressure, leading to a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. The current price action hovers around critical levels that attract the attention of traders. Jupiter faces resistance near $0.7832, with a more formidable barrier at $1.03, while solid support can be found around $0.2726 and a deeper safety net at $0.0173. Technical indicators like an RSI of 38.95 show that bears have the upper hand. A negative Awesome Oscillator further emphasizes bearish momentum. Traders may consider setting limits close to support, waiting for a clear reversal before looking for a movement beyond resistance. Uptrend Hopes Amid Recent Lows for Stacks (STX) STX experienced a steady slide over the past month and deep challenges over the last six months. The price declined by approximately 34% in one month and nearly 71% over six months, reflecting significant downward pressure. A one-week drop of 12% added to the overall negative sentiment, showcasing an environment of substantial weakness. These figures highlight a market struggling to regain momentum during a volatile period with minimal signs of recovery. The current price action is in a range between $0.61 and $0.97, with key levels to monitor. Immediate support is near $0.47, while resistance is at $1.21. Additional support and resistance are marked at $0.10 and $1.58 respectively. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with the Relative Strength Index at 34 indicating possible overselling. Bears currently dominate the market, although oscillators suggest a potential opportunity if prices hold at lower levels and bounce from support. Trading ideas involve watching for a break above $1.21 or maintaining support above $0.47, with a cautious strategy in place until a clear trend emerges. Celestia Price Action: Past Decline and Current Trading Window Celestia experienced a sharp decline over the past months, with a one-month drop of 26.19% and a six-month decline of 69.57%. A weekly loss of 7.78% indicates ongoing downward pressure. The price range has fluctuated between $1.70 and $3.05 during this period, reflecting significant sell-offs and weak buying interest in response to persistent bearish signals. Celestia currently trades between approximately $1.70 and $3.05. Nearest support is at $1.20, while resistance sits near $3.91, creating a clear trading window. Weak momentum is evident with an Awesome Oscillator at -0.52 and a Momentum Indicator at -0.48, indicating bear control. The relative strength index of 35.46 shows the coin is oversold, highlighting risks for upward moves. Price action is range-bound without a clear trend, and trading ideas suggest entries near $1.20 aiming for rebounds to around $3.05, with caution for potential short positions if support is breached. Conclusion The crypto market's next big move hinges on the CPI results, which could impact rate cut expectations. JUP , STX , and TIA stand out as strong picks for potential gains in the coming rally. These coins offer promising prospects due to their unique features and market positions. As the situation evolves, these three cryptocurrencies are worth watching closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Tech Behind The 40,000% ROI Hype Analysts Can’t Stop Talking About",https://timestabloid.com/is-floppypepes-success-more-than-luck-the-tech-behind-the-40000/,"FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out in the volatile crypto market , sparking both intrigue and skepticism amid projections of a staggering 40,000% ROI. Although some people see this prediction as merely speculative, the token is built on new AI technology, useful features, and a strong community that validates the projection. These key points set it apart from typical meme coins, as analysts believe that the project could shape the future of Web3 investments. The Engine Behind FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 40,000% ROI: AI, Tools, and Real-World Tech FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) exponential ROI projections aren’t built on blind optimism. At the core is a robust tech stack that includes FloppyX , a next-gen AI video bot framework, and Meme-o-Matic , an AI-driven meme creation engine. These tools help users earn money as a reward for their creativity. FloppyX: This AI tool allows real-time crypto market interactions, AI-generated video content, and even custom brand storytelling via self-aware digital agents. In practice, this means influencers, brands, and communities can automate dynamic engagement content in minutes and also profit from it. Meme-o-Matic: This meme generation engine democratizes content creation. Even users with zero design experience can craft high-quality, trend-adaptive memes with witty captions that boost their viral potential. Excluding AI technology, security is also a key focus of this project, with FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) smart contract audited by SolidProof . The meme project also offers additional protection through the use of multi-signature wallets and community education, helping to prevent hacks and build lasting investors’ trust. With the backing of AI and a sure-fire security protocol, confidence in this meme coin’s projected ROI grows, offering early presale buyers potentially life-changing gains. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Presale Momentum, Bonus Incentives, And Market Effect FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) ongoing presale is another major ROI driver that is already significantly impacting the crypto market and broader investors. By joining the presale, participants gain: Heavily discounted entry at $0.00000035 relative to a higher post-listing price 80% token bonus allocations like the ongoing FLOPPY80 bonus that compound potential ROI Access to airdrops, staking perks, and early product releases A well-structured referral system also drives exponential community growth with every user invite multiplying the token’s visibility and liquidity, a vital ingredient in achieving those multi-thousand percent ROI forecasts. Floppynomics And Marketing: A Framework Built For Sustainability FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) zero-tax token, 1% burn rate, and 1% redistribution model together form a floppynomics design aimed at sustainable value creation. Unlike inflationary meme projects, it operates on a deflationary schedule, meaning as trading volume increases, supply tightens to create an ideal condition for sharp price appreciation. Accompanying these great features are staking mechanisms, yield farming partnerships, and tiered access to premium features serve to persuade long-term holding, reduce sell pressure, and keep the ecosystem lucrative—all while compounding ROI potential for committed participants. FloppyPepe’s (FFPE) 40,000% rally thesis has also been confirmed by various market analysts. With top crypto YouTubers like David in Crypto and Crypto Legends praising its massive ROI potential, and the project securing attention across Reddit, Telegram, and TikTok, this meme coin is set for global expansion. Key expansion efforts include: Tier 1 CEX listings to increase token visibility and volume CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko submissions for price tracking credibility Global partnerships in real-world ecosystems Airdrop campaigns, AI art challenges, and community giveaways to encourage user retention. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Bonus Era Won’t Last With a clear roadmap, practical AI integration, advanced tools, and layered incentives, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is laying the groundwork for a massive ROI realization that is already in motion. Every feature, from its Meme-o-Matic tool to its FloppyX infrastructure, serves as a node in a value network designed for exponential returns. Currently, the project’s presale offers tokens at a discounted rate of $0.00000035 , accompanied by an 80% bonus with the code FLOPPY80 , positioning early investors for significant upside. The math is simple: those who entered during the private round are already riding the initial wave of a monumental ROI curve. With the presale still live and the referral engine gaining momentum, those who get in now stand to gain massive ROI potential as Tier 1 listings and deflationary burn are activated.

Over the past 24 hours, XRP’s market capitalization has surged by approximately $6.25 billion, rising from $127.97 billion to $134.22 billion. XRP one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap This influx of capital is reflected in the price action, with XRP currently trading at $2.29, up more than 4% on the day and nearly 6% over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical standpoint, XRP is hovering around its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ), a level often viewed as a critical short-term trend indicator. The price remains well above its 200-day SMA at $1.90, reinforcing the asset’s longer-term bullish trajectory. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 46.61, suggesting neutral momentum but leaving room for considerable upside. XRP’s path to $3 Looking ahead, pseudonymous crypto analyst Theodor Coin highlighted in a June 8 CoinMarketCap post that certain key price levels may help XRP reclaim the $3 mark. According to the analyst, XRP has spent the past two weeks consolidating within a narrowing range and experiencing decreasing volatility, a setup that often precedes sharp directional moves historically. He noted that the current clustering around the $2.20 to $2.25 zone indicates sellers may lose conviction, although bulls have yet to take full control. XRP price analysis chart. Source: CoinMarketCap However, he emphasized that a breakout above $2.27, especially if supported by strong volume, could spark a rally toward $2.90, potentially forming the right shoulder of a larger reversal pattern. On the flip side, a breakdown below $2.20 might see XRP retesting $1.99 or even sliding toward the broader $0.99 macro support level if sentiment deteriorates sharply. For now, with momentum leaning positive, it appears XRP is capitalizing on broader market sentiment as it sets its sights on reclaiming the $2.50 resistance. XRP fundamentals Beyond technical indicators and market trends, the lingering legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) could catalyze XRP’s price movement. Investors are watching for a resolution, especially after the presiding judge initially rejected the settlement proposal due to procedural errors. In this context, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has identified June 16 as a potentially pivotal date. On that day, the SEC is expected to submit its status report to the Appeals Court, marking the conclusion of a 60-day window. Morgan suggested that some form of development is likely imminent, otherwise, the appeal and cross-appeal process will move forward, requiring Ripple to file its briefing.

Looking for growth, investors have turned to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The innovative features of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are fast making it one of the most talked-about projects in DeFi. Let us take a deep dive into the features offered. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token The success of the platform is closely tied to the success of the MUTM tokens, especially in the early stage of the platform, since it is new to the market. The token must meet the expectations of investors to ensure that Mutuum Finance attracts enough users. To ensure the token succeeds, the team plans to use various incentives and mechanisms to attract new users. The first strategy will involve directing most of the protocol’s revenue to buying MUTM tokens on the open market. This will have the direct impact of raising the price of the tokens on exchanges where they are expected to be listed. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers who contribute to the safety module for a set period. This strategy will also be crucial to absorbing the selling pressure from the presale buyers. Additionally, it will help to balance liquidity mining emissions needed to ensure favorable conditions for lenders and borrowers on the protocol. After this initial buying of MUTM tokens, the team will move on to a new stage, where protocol profits will be reinvested into the platform. The investments will be directed at expanding the pools, the safety fund, marketing activities, and more. However, they plan to keep buying MUTM tokens using protocol proceeds with a set upper cap for rewards. This will ensure the protocol’s growth is not hampered. That will ensure that the buy and distribute program is efficient. The goal is to ensure a successful launch of MUTM tokens that will spur long-term value addition on the protocol. The Mutuum Finance roadmap Mutuum Finance has an exhaustive roadmap that covers all critical points needed to make this project a long-term success. So far, they have completed 75% of the milestones for phase 1. The only two milestones remaining are the creation of education content and the formation of a legal team. One of the most notable milestones in phase 1 of the roadmap is the completion of an external audit. The team listed the results of their CertiK audit, which they successfully completed. The audit reports stated that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a safe project for early investors. It has played a critical role in boosting confidence in the presale, which has now raised over $10.1 million. The other notable milestone in phase 1 of the roadmap is the successful listing on a tracking platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was officially listed on CoinMarketCap, which is a major achievement considering that it is still in the presale stage. The CertiK audit also means that the process of getting listed on a top-tier crypto exchange will be much easier. Leading crypto exchanges often perform security checks before adding new projects. One of their main requirements is a CertiK audit. Coupled with the massive following online and the huge war chest from the presale, the team is expected to list MUTM on a major exchange with ease. The CoinMarketCap listing provided a huge boost in trust, since the platform carefully vets new projects before listing. With the results of the CertiK audit, the process was quite easy. It signals that Mutuum Finance is a safe project. The listing will ensure that traders will have an easy means by which to discover the project, which is expected to provide a massive boost once the tokens are publicly listed. Update on the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been a massive success that has sent waves throughout the crypto market. So far, it has raised over $10.1 million. Participation in the presale has been gaining momentum, and it has over 11,700 unique buyers to date. Tokens in the current phase 5 presale are going for $0.03, which is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. Despite the increase, the pace of the presale has gone up, with over 25% of the tokens in phase 5 of the presale already sold, barely a week after it began. One of the main catalysts for the fast speed of the presale is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . The team plans to give away $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten lucky winners each. To participate in the giveaway, you only need to make a $50 purchase of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is a hotbed of technical innovation that will upend DeFi as we know it. By adding MUTM to your portfolio at the low price of $0.03, you have a chance to be part of one of the biggest DeFi projects while it is still on the ground floor.

GameStop stock ended the week at $29.58, down 16% from its highest point this year. Its market capitalization is over $13 billion. Wall Street analysts expect the company’s core business results to show sustained weakness as more customers pivot towards online games. Data compiled by Yahoo Finance show that revenue will be $754 million, down by 14.47% from the same period last year. Analysts also expect its guidance for the second quarter to be $748 million, down 6.28% year over year. The estimate for its annual revenue is $3.56 billion and $3.13 billion next year. These numbers will represent a continuation of what has been happening. GameStop’s annual revenue moved from $6 billion in 2022 to $5.27 billion in 2023 and $3.8 billion last year.

This explains why the company decided to emulate Strategy, a company whose valuation has jumped to over $100 billion because of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings. GameStop has become one of the biggest Bitcoin holders. It holds 4,710 coins valued at over $497 million, and the management hopes to continue purchasing. GameStop has room to boost its Bitcoin holdings because of its strong balance sheet. It ended the last quarter with over $4.7 billion in cash, short-term investments, and no debt. Its equity valuation of over $13 billion also gives itthe flexibility to sell shares to fund these purchases. The company’s Bitcoin holdings to market cap are 3.76% (in contrast, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is 58%). GME stock price analysis GameStop stock chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the GME share price has retreated since it started implementing its Bitcoin strategy. It moved from $35 in May to $29.58. This price is inside the ascending channel connecting the highest and lowest swings since May last year. The stock remains above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a bullish thing. GME stock’s outlook is neutral ahead of its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, set to be released after the market closes on Tuesday, June 10. The key levels to watch will be the psychological point at $20 and the resistance point at $35.78.

Percoco said open Wi-Fi connections, fake QR codes, unattended devices and USB charging stations used at events pose serious threats. In a statement published on Kraken’s official blog, Percoco said that as crypto conferences become more global and large-scale with each passing year, personal security has taken a backseat. “From New York to Dubai to Singapore, these events are a sign that crypto is moving into the mainstream. However, along with this growth has come a quiet but worrying trend: Personal security measures are starting to be underestimated,” he said. Kraken’s security team has discovered a number of open vulnerabilities at conferences they’ve attended, including laptops left idle and unlocked, and unprotected phones with wallet notifications on their desktops, showing how easily digital assets can be compromised. “In the crypto world, digital devices are not just a phone or a computer; they are safes for you, your crypto assets, and the organization you are affiliated with. Always keep your devices locked and never let them out of your sight,” Percoco warned. Related News: Whale Activity Indicator at Its Peak in On-Chain Data - Here Are the Altcoins They Are Trading The statement emphasized that it poses a great risk for participants to discuss high-value transactions in public areas with a conference badge. Percoco stated that this situation makes it easier for malicious people to target them, adding, “Someone may be listening to you. Be careful.” The Kraken team also warned against fake QR codes and malicious USB charging stations at event venues. “With just one QR code label change, hundreds of attendees could be put at risk. We recommend using low-balance, limited-access wallets for events,” it said. It was also stated that users should use their own charging adapters to protect against the threat of “juice jacking,” which is the loading of malicious software onto devices via USB charging stations. *This is not investment advice.

The City of Richmond, Virginia says it will provide a one-time housing assistance grant of $1,200 to each of the successful applicants of the RVA Stay Gap Grant Program. According to the city, $3.9 million is available for the program and the grants will be handed out on a “first come, first serve basis.” Applicants of the RVA Stay Gap Grant Program must be residents of the City of Richmond and must prove that their annual housing costs are equal to or more than 30% of their total household income to qualify. Applicants must also be in the bottom 80% of the low-income category and must not be receiving other forms of housing assistance from the City of Richmond. If the applicant is a renter, they must possess a current lease bearing their name. If a homeowner, they must possess a current mortgage with their name on it. “Renter annual housing costs may include rent, tenant renter’s insurance for personal property, and utility costs. Owner annual housing costs may include mortgage payments and utility costs.” For successful applicants who are homeowners, the grant will first go towards paying their real estate taxes and the balance will then be sent to them in a check. In the case of successful applicants who are renters, the entire grant of $1,200 will be sent to their landlord. The deadline for applications is December 31st. Applicants will be notified within eight weeks whether they have been accepted or rejected for the City of Richmond’s RVA Stay Gap Grant Program.

Notably, prominent cryptocurrency personalities are highlighting the many ways in which the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin could benefit from any future meltdown recorded in the global finance market as a result of the increasing national debt in the United States. According to data from USAfacts , the federal debt as of April 2025 is $36.2 trillion, marking a 2% increase from April 2024 and a 31% increase from 2019. In response to the newly released data, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, took to X to share his prediction for the near future. The crypto founder explained the need for the U.S. electorate to persuade the U.S. Congress to decrease the federal government’s spending. Convinced that Bitcoin could go on to replace the U.S. dollar as a national reserve currency if the national deficit continues to skyrocket, Brian Armstrong wrote; “If the electorate doesn’t hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as a reserve currency.” Armstrong, whose cryptocurrency exchange—the largest in the country—is bound to benefit from the U.S. government’s adoption of Bitcoin, emphasized the need for stability, suggesting that Bitcoin might not yet be fit to replace the U.S. dollar as national reserve currency. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” He added . While Bitcoin might not be replacing the U.S. dollar in the U.S. central bank as a currency held in the largest quantity, President Trump’s executive order for the “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile,” will allow the Federal government to manage the cryptocurrency as a U.S. reserve asset.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Brian Armstrong|Coinbase|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-08 16:50:26

In an interview during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, Khosrowshahi says that Uber is looking at the use cases for stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to other assets such as the US dollar. “We’re still in the study phase, but I think stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value. Obviously, you can have your opinions on Bitcoin, but it’s a proven commodity, and people have different opinions on where it’s going.” One stablecoin use case that Khosrowshahi believes could benefit Uber and other companies is its potential to reduce the costs associated with transferring money internationally. “I do think that stablecoin is quite promising, especially for global companies that are moving money around globally to create a mechanism for us to essentially reduce costs in terms of moving money internationally. So that’s super interesting to us. And we’re definitely going to take a look.” Khosrowshani’s statements come following stablecoin giant Circle’s debut as a public company on Thursday.

The office mentioned that his social media endorsement was made in a personal capacity without using federal resources. The anti-corruption office, operating under a government ministry, concluded that Milei’s X post promoting the token did not violate federal ethics laws governing public officials. However, a separate federal criminal court investigation into the matter remains ongoing.

As part of a project named “Viva La Libertad” (Long Live Freedom), Delaware-registered corporation Kelsier Ventures introduced the Libra ( LIBRA ) token on Feb. 14. Within minutes of its launch, President Milei posted about it on his X account. Additionally, he defined it as an endeavor to boost Argentine economic expansion by assisting startups and small enterprises with private investment made possible by blockchain technology. Milei described the token as a valid private economic endeavor and posted the token’s blockchain contract address as part of his support. Within 40 minutes, the price of LIBRA surged from near-zero to approximately $5 per token. It also reached a peak market capitalization of roughly $4.5 billion. The euphoria proved short-lived as the token’s founders, who controlled approximately 70% of the total supply, liquidated their holdings at peak prices.

It also caused losses between $100 million and $250 million Milei has consistently denied any improper conduct and maintained that his social media activity was intended to raise awareness about cryptocurrency’s potential to support Argentine businesses rather than encourage direct investment. The president emphasized that his posts followed a meeting with Libra’s founders and represented personal views. The anti-corruption office’s decision focuses specifically on whether Milei violated ethics rules for public officials. They concluded that personal social media usage does not constitute improper use of government resources. The ongoing federal criminal investigation examines different aspects of the case and potentially includes securities law violations and market manipulation charges. Criminal courts operate independently from administrative ethics reviews, which means separate legal proceedings could reach different conclusions.

A comprehensive dive into the latest data reveals if these cryptocurrencies are set for growth. The analysis aims to uncover key indicators and what they mean for the future of these digital assets. Stay tuned for a detailed breakdown. POL (ex-MATIC) Market Trends: Past Decline and Key Price Levels POL has traded in a narrow range between approximately $0.184 and $0.260, displaying a notable downward trend in recent times. Over the last month, the coin has lost about 16.25% of its value, while a more significant drop of nearly 63.90% has occurred over the past six months, indicating a sharp decline in market sentiment. Price activity during these periods shows persistent bearish pressure, diminishing trader confidence and reflecting struggles to maintain previous highs amid broader market risk aversion. Currently, POL is positioned within defined boundaries that traders are monitoring. The nearest support level is at around $0.154, with resistance near $0.307. A secondary support exists near $0.078, while upper resistance is approximately $0.383, which could act as pivot points for short-term movements. Technical indicators suggest a cautious environment; the RSI is just below neutral, and the overall sentiment remains biased to the downside. Trading strategies might include observing for a bounce off the support around $0.154 for potential entry points, along with a focus on a break above $0.307 as a possible sign for renewed buying interest. Avalanche (AVAX): Past Decline and Key Price Levels Overview AVAX declined sharply over the last six months, with prices falling 54.91% from earlier levels. The past month saw an 8.32% drop, accompanied by a 2.40% decrease in the last week. Prices moved between $17.67 and $25.40, highlighting a continuous slide that has shaped recent performance. The long-term drop contrasts with the milder weekly and monthly shifts, indicating consistent selling pressure that has led to a steady erosion of value in the market. Current trends show AVAX trading between significant resistance levels and strong support boundaries. Resistance is set at $29.98, with further resistance at $37.70. Support is nearby at $14.52, with deeper support at $6.79 where buyers might emerge. Indicators reflect bearish pressure, and sentiment is tilted toward sellers. Price action lacks a clear trend but remains influenced by ongoing negative momentum. Traders may consider entering positions near $14.52 support or watching for a break above $29.98 to gauge bullish interest, while maintaining caution with volume signals. Solana Price Analysis: Key Levels Amid Recent Declines Solana ’s recent performance saw an 8.86% drop in the past month and a steeper decline of 30.93% over the last six months. Price movements have showcased significant downward shifts, impacting short-term gains and investor sentiment. The recent volatility has resulted in a narrower trading band, reflecting caution among market participants. This extended downtrend over six months highlights challenges in price action, with attempts at recovery consistently failing due to persistent bearish pressure. The coin is currently trading between $136 and $182, with immediate resistance at $207.90 and support at $115.84. A second resistance level is at $253.93, while broader support is located around $69.81. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator and momentum values suggest prevailing bearish sentiment. An RSI reading of 39.57 points to downward pressure, with prices remaining within these key levels. Trading strategies include buying near lower support with tight stop-losses and shorting near resistance, while observing for breakouts that could signal a change in market sentiment. Conclusion The latest data indicates a potential shift in market momentum for POL , AVAX , and SOL . Price patterns and trading volumes hint at a bullish reversal. Attention is drawn to consistent upward trends and strong buyer support. Continued monitoring of key resistance levels and market trends is essential to confirm if the rally solidifies. Current indicators are promising and suggest positive movement. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

PEPE Whale Activity Surges & Pi Network Price Seeks Stability,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-successfully-clears-certiks-audit-pepe-whale-activity-surges-pi-network-price-seeks-stability/,"When trust begins to outweigh hype, projects showing action instead of ambition tend to capture more attention. PEPE is gaining ground through increased large holder activity and blockchain signals. Pi Network is in focus again as its price approaches a vital level. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is setting itself apart in a notable way. While many projects seek validation later, BlockDAG has already completed a successful CertiK audit during its presale, showing a commitment to transparency early on. Where others chase momentum, BlockDAG is creating it through verified security steps. For those who prioritize substance over speculation, it’s becoming a standout pick. BlockDAG’s CertiK Approval Signals Strong Security and Community Growth BlockDAG has crossed another big milestone and now stands among the top crypto to watch. The project recently cleared its CertiK audit with strong results, underscoring its dedication to security protocols and clear communication. Rather than waiting until listing, BlockDAG went ahead with its audit mid-presale. This shows clear planning and a focus on doing things the right way. CertiK’s review process checks various layers, including logic, security, and permissions, and BlockDAG received high marks in all areas. At the same time, conversations across X and Telegram show rising enthusiasm. Several users have described this moment as a major confidence signal, while creators in the space are starting to pay closer attention. Remarks like “This presale stands out” and “Real transparency in action” are becoming frequent, pointing to growing belief in the project’s direction. BlockDAG has now raised over $289 million, sold more than 22.1 billion coins, and delivered a 2,520% increase in returns since batch 1. It is currently in batch 28, priced at $0.0262. However, thanks to a limited-time offer, the price is reduced to $0.0018 until June 13. As the CertiK approval brings more attention, this could bring in high-volume buyers looking for a reliable entry point. For anyone searching for the top crypto to watch, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a clear front-runner. PEPE Coin Price Builds Strength as Key Indicators Turn Positive PEPE’s price performance is starting to turn heads, with technical signals and blockchain activity aligning in its favor. A golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day averages is forming, often seen as a longer-term bullish sign. Attention is focused on the $0.00001266 resistance, with some forecasts pointing toward a potential move to the $0.000015 to $0.000016 range. Other tools back this trend. The MACD shows declining selling momentum, while the RSI around 51 suggests buyers are gradually gaining strength. Wallet data adds further support: smart money addresses have picked up over 642 billion PEPE coins over the last month, representing a 150% surge. Whale wallets now control more than 10 trillion coins, hinting at deeper confidence in price growth. Additionally, the amount of PEPE held on exchanges has dropped from 160 trillion to around 105 trillion since January. With more long-term holders and fewer coins on the market, the price could be on track for a stronger rally. Pi Network Price Seeks Stability Amid Key Technical Pattern The Pi Network price has pulled back significantly from its May high of $1.66 and is now holding near $0.65. This correction followed a spike in token unlocks and trading activity, adding pressure on price. Still, a potential slanted triple-bottom pattern is forming, with a neckline close to the previous high. If confirmed, this pattern could trigger a rise of more than 160% in the near future. This $0.65 level is not new, it has acted as solid support in April and May. Technical charts show price holding slightly above an upward-sloping line, which may lead to recovery if buyer interest returns. But if this support fails, the price could fall to around $0.40. For now, many are watching closely, seeing this as a turning point in Pi’s short-term movement. Final Call! As the market focuses on results, buyers are now looking past hype and chasing clarity. PEPE is showing signs of building strength, and Pi Network is sitting at a price level that could go either way. BlockDAG, meanwhile, has made its move early. Its successful CertiK audit, rapid presale progress, and open development plan give it a strong position. Unlike others that wait for post-launch approval, BlockDAG is proving its reliability right now. For those looking for top crypto to watch with a focus on track record, clear updates, and real-time execution, BlockDAG makes a solid case.

It’s the first time this wallet has shown activity in two years. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 In 2025? Analyst Highlights The Trigger The purchase has stirred talk among traders and on-chain analysts alike. Some see it as a sign that big players are getting ready for more action in the weeks ahead. Whale Returns After Two Years According to Lookonchain data, the same whale pulled 500 BTC out of Gemini back in 2022 when Bitcoin was trading near $27,400, a move worth nearly $14 million at the time. Now, with BTC hovering around $105,000, the whale’s holdings sit on an unrealized gain of over $39 million. That kind of profit margin grabs attention. Other large holders often watch these moves closely. They wonder if this is the start of a wider trend or just one wallet’s play. A whale that had been dormant for 2 years bought another 250 $BTC($26.37M) 9 hours ago. 2 years ago, this whale withdrew 500 $BTC($13.7M) from Gemini at $27,401, now sitting on an unrealized profit of $39M.https://t.co/c0U92isSfc pic.twitter.com/vcb4V3M0Uz — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 8, 2025 Big Gains On Early Bet Early adopters have seen massive upside in Bitcoin over the years. This whale’s 2022 withdrawal came just before a multi-year price boom. Since then, Bitcoin has climbed nearly 300%. Not everyone can make moves like that. Small investors often feel left behind when a wallet this size shifts coins. Still, some traders say it can create a ripple of optimism. When big holders buy, retail traders sometimes pile in, chasing the same gains. Technical Indicators Show Mixed Signals On the charts, BTC seems to be shaping an inverse cup-and-handle pattern with a significant neckline at $100,800 serving as major support. The price has fallen into the handle stage, and a dip below $100,800 could propel Bitcoin to $91,000, which coincides with its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) is 52, indicating the bullish momentum is fading. A fall below 50 could introduce additional selling pressure. For the bulls to regain control, BTC must recapture the 20-day EMA resistance, which is just above $105,000.

From a broader perspective, BTC will be targeting the $110,000 mark and looking to reclaim its all-time-high price. With the premier cryptocurrency already closing in on the $106,000 level, the question is — where is the next obstacle in this recovery journey? BTC Price Faces Significant Resistance Above $106K In a new post on the social media platform X, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed two major levels that could be critical to the mid- to long-term trajectory of the Bitcoin price. This analysis is based on the realized price of a specific class of investors known as short-term holders (STH). The Bitcoin short-term holders are known for their reactive and speculative nature, as they are often triggered by sudden price movements. Hence, these investors tend to open and close their positions within a short period. In his post on X, Kesmeci revealed three important levels based on the realized prices of investors within certain unspent transaction output (UTXO) age bands. Specifically, the on-chain analyst highlighted cost bases of investors within 1 week – 4 week ($106,200), 1 month – 3 month ($87,300), and 3 month – 6 month ($97,500) age bands. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin price is likely to face significant resistance at around the $106,200 level, where 1-week – 4-week investors have their cost bases. The rationale behind this is that STH at a loss may close their positions when they return to their cost basis, leading to downward pressure and the formation of a resistance level. On the flip side, Kesmeci also highlighted the realized price ($97,500) of short-term investors within the 3-month – 6-month age band as another critical level for the Bitcoin price . The analyst mentioned investors within this class may consider a move towards this realized price as an opportunity to defend their positions, leading to the formation of a support cushion. In essence, this piece of on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin price might be approaching a major resistance level just above $106,000. If it successfully breaches this level, investors might see the premier cryptocurrency revisit its all-time high of $111,871. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $105,700, reflecting a 1.3% increase in the past 24 hours.

As revealed, these workers pretended to be remote employees who earned money illegally. These criminals usually send the money back to North Korea to help the government avoid sanctions and fund its military programs . North Korean Workers Infiltrate Global Tech Companies The DOJ reported that North Korean IT workers got jobs at crypto companies in the U.S. and other countries by using fake or stolen identities. They did not work from North Korea but from places like China, Russia, and Laos. They hid who they were to get remote jobs, mainly in blockchain and crypto firms. In April, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group reported that North Korean agents have expanded their operations beyond the U.S. They are now targeting companies in the UK, Germany, Portugal, and Serbia. The targets include firms developing AI tools, blockchain apps, and smart contracts on the Solana network. These operatives often use local contacts to bypass identity checks and receive payments through services like TransferWise and Payoneer. North Korea Criminals Launder Crypto with Fake IDs and Tricks The workers were paid in stablecoins like USDC and USDT. To avoid being caught, they laundered the money by moving small amounts through fake accounts, then sent it back to North Korea. They also buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and use crypto mixers to cover their tracks. After cleaning the money, they sent it back to North Korea. The authorities have arrested two people who helped move the money. The accomplices include Sim Hyon Sop, who worked for North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank, and Kim Sang Man, who worked with the Ministry of Defense. In April 2023, the U.S. charged Sim Hyon Sop with two crimes, including working with fake IT employees to earn money from U.S. companies and using that money to buy goods for North Korea through illegal crypto trades. Expert Says IT North Korean Scammers Earn a Million in Dollars Many experts say this is not a one-time case. Andrew Fierman from Chainalysis warned that IT fraud is a steady income source for North Korean criminals. He cited a previous DOJ case where 14 North Koreans made $88 million over six years using similar scams. Fierman said these scams also fund North Korea’s spying and cyberattacks. Security expert Michael Barnhart added that North Korean workers are inside many companies, sometimes creating fake crypto businesses or joining ones with weak security. He estimates they could be making hundreds of millions yearly through illegal jobs. Fierman revealed these scammers are hard to catch because they use advanced tools. They use AI-created fake profiles and deepfake videos to pass interviews. They also use software to cheat on technical tests, making them look like real applicants.

Brad Garlinghouse, the firm’s CEO, pushed back on rumors suggesting that the firm was in talks with Circle and in the process of establishing an acquisition deal. Georgetown law professor Chris Brummer, who interviewed Brad Garlinghouse at the Ripple Las Vegas Conference, took X to summarize their interaction. “Brad was unequivocal that Ripple didn’t pursue an acquisition of Circle. (Update: one response suggests that Brad really said that Ripple never offered 10B for Circle, so perhaps Ripple floated an offer at another price point). Perhaps! Whatever the case, his main point was clear: while he wished Circle well, he wasn’t considering any acquisition.” Brummer wrote. Garlinghouse’s assertion clarifies the ongoing conversation among market participants. Last week, insider sources disclosed that Circle was engaging in “informal” talks with Ripple and Coinbase about a potential acquisition deal. While Circle and Coinbase did not address the rumors, both firms have established longstanding relationships through crypto-based partnerships. Ripple throws weight behind RLUSD stablecoin Meanwhile, Ripple appears to have its gaze set on accelerating the capabilities of its RLUSD stablecoin. The firm’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage platform Hidden Road suggests that the firm is set to position the stablecoin as on-ledger collateral, to memorialize transactions on the XRP Ledger, Bummer asserted. “This is infrastructure thinking—boring to some, but foundational to all.” He noted . Brummer further highlighted the UAE’s engagement with Ripple on tokenized real estate, along with the Ripple CEO’s visit to the SEC—an experience that Garlinghouse describes as “personal,” explaining that both developments reflect Ripple’s interest in merging the cryptocurrency ecosystem with the traditional finance industry. “Ultimately, I walked away with a sense that Ripple isn’t chasing a world where crypto replaces TradFi. It’s betting on a world where the two are hybridized—where tokenized assets, stablecoins, and traditional financial institutions coexist and interoperate. If they’re right—and I think they are— then that means that the next wave of acquisitions won’t just be AMMs or token launchers.” The professor asserted.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|WALLET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-08 17:07:17

Widely respected for its decentralized oracle services, Chainlink continues to serve as a critical bridge between smart contracts and real-world data, driving innovation across DeFi, gaming, insurance, and beyond. While LINK is expected to surge in value, another name is quietly rising in the ranks— Qubetics , a next-gen blockchain platform currently in a record-breaking presale phase. This article explores Chainlink’s price outlook for 2026 and takes a close look at Qubetics’ rapid momentum. Chainlink Price Forecast for 2026 According to crypto analysts and predictive models, Chainlink is positioned for a bullish year in 2026. The token is expected to maintain steady growth, driven by expanding adoption across both enterprise and decentralized ecosystems. Based on historical performance and market sentiment, LINK could trade between $30.35 and $35.15, with an average projected value of $31.39 by year’s end. The rising demand for secure, real-time data in smart contracts, especially as DeFi and real-world asset tokenization grow, continues to solidify Chainlink’s role as foundational infrastructure in the Web3 landscape. The platform’s constant evolution and growing list of partnerships are further fueling investor confidence. Chainlink Monthly Outlook: 2026 Performance Overview Month-by-month projections show a gradual and consistent climb for LINK throughout 2026. The year could open with LINK hovering around $17 and gradually build momentum by spring. March may see prices reaching just over $20, while April could usher in a strong upswing toward $22. By mid-year, LINK could trade around $25 to $27, eventually breaking past $30 in September. By December 2026, Chainlink may top out at $35.15, marking a powerful close to the year and potentially rewarding long-term holders with meaningful gains. Qubetics: The Crypto Turning Heads While Chainlink rides the wave of continued adoption, Qubetics is emerging as a serious contender in the blockchain space. Currently in its 37th presale round, Qubetics has already raised over $17.7 million from more than 27,500 participants. The token—$TICS—is now priced at $0.3370. A key reason for growing investor interest is Qubetics’ recent move to slash its total token supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, creating scarcity and strengthening its long-term value proposition. With 38.55% of tokens allocated to the public, the project is clearly committed to a decentralized future. Qubetics isn’t just attracting capital—it’s building a name as a secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready blockchain infrastructure. With a clear focus on real-world use cases and decentralization, industry watchers believe the token could see significant upside after listing. Qubetics: The Decentralized VPN Redefining Internet Privacy Traditional VPNs are no longer enough. They’re centralized, prone to logging user data, and vulnerable to shutdowns or hacks. Qubetics offers a revolutionary alternative: a peer-to-peer decentralized VPN (dVPN) powered by blockchain. It encrypts all your traffic, routes it through a global network of nodes, and rewards users who contribute bandwidth with $TICS tokens. Qubetics turns internet access into a community-owned utility. You’re not just a user—you’re part of the network, helping to power a censorship-resistant, privacy-first internet. Privacy is no longer optional. With Qubetics, it’s built in. Final Thoughts: LINK’s Bright Future and Qubetics’ Breakout Potential All signs point to 2026 being a defining year for Chainlink, with projections indicating a price climb to $35.15 as its ecosystem matures. With expanding integrations and vital roles in multiple Web3 sectors, LINK remains a strong candidate for long-term investment. At the same time, Qubetics presents a fresh opportunity for early movers. With strong crypto presale performance, reduced token supply, and growing community support, it offers a compelling alternative for those looking to diversify beyond blue-chip assets like Chainlink. Whether you’re preparing to capitalize on LINK’s predicted growth or seeking early exposure to promising newcomers like Qubetics, the months ahead offer fertile ground for strategic crypto investing.

Circle stock surged 167% in its NYSE debut on June 5, re-igniting comparisons between the two stablecoin giants. $515 Billion? “A Bit Bearish,” Says Ardoino Ardoino’s comments followed a bold valuation estimate by Artmesis CEO Jon Ma, who claimed Tether could be worth $515 billion if it went public—ranking it among the world’s 20 largest companies. While he called the figure a “beautiful number,” Ardoino suggested it might actually be too conservative. “Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + gold treasury, yet I’m very humbled,” he said. Key Bitcoin influencers like Anthony Pompliano and Jack Mallers believe Tether can potentially reach a $1 trillion valuation. Strategic Investments Reflects Long-Term Vision Tether’s USDT is currently the third-largest crypto by market cap at $154.83 billion. The company has been aggressively expanding into Bitcoin holdings and infrastructure. On April 24, Tether acquired a majority stake in Twenty One Capital, a Bitcoin treasury firm founded by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. The firm, newly formed as it is, is now the world’s third-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, ranking behind Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and MARA Holdings. Billions in Bitcoin on the Move On June 3, Tether transferred over 37,229 Bitcoin—worth approximately $3.9 billion—into addresses tied to the new Bitcoin-native financial platform. The moves illustrate the company’s long-term bitcoin optimism and its strategy of building value off the traditional public market path. “I’m very excited about the next stage of growth of our company,” Ardoino added.",Blockchain|Tether,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-08 17:26:00

Nowadays, many traders try to gain insights on cryptos that are doing well now and research the best ones for long term gains. After falling out of the limelight, SHIB is being replaced by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as people are noticing its fast-growing potential and noticing potential for huge gains. $10.1 million has been gathered, reaching more than 11,700 investors. It seems that a lot of investors are attracted to this at $0.03, as prices could rise 16.67% to $0.035. New users have a guarantee that they will receive double their money after the project hits $0.06 price. The Price of Shiba Inu Pushed Lower as Market Goes Down At the moment, a Shiba Inu (SHIB) is worth 0.000013 USD which is a 0.91% decline from the previous price. Though lots of SHIB were destroyed and the number kept going up, the price did not change because so many are still available. SHIB’s last price on the day was $0.00001317 which was less than its 100-day simple moving average. If SHIB drops to $0.000012, it could reach $0.00001238 which means investors should pay close attention. For these reasons, people pay extra attention to returns offered by other investors and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a crypto that people are watching as it gains recognition in the market. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Investors’ interest in Mutuum Finance is on the rise which is causing the presale to grow. Because of its two-way lending model, Mutuum Finance has enjoyed huge popularity in 2025. More than 11,700 people have put $10.1 million into the presale. In Phase 6, the price of MUTM token will rise to $0.035 from $0.03, showing a 16.67% increase. Both strong demand from users and good lending methods have made MUTM an appealing DeFi project that is expected to reach $6 after the launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Following the Certik Audit Mutuum merges Peer-to-Contract (P2C) with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) to create one system. Both USDT pools and smart contracts offer rewards in P2C, while in P2P people can exchange assets and control their payments freely. Because of these reasons, people interested in high yields find DeFi trading safer, more convenient and more attractive. USD-pegged stablecoin will be introduced by Mutuum Finance which backs it with the dollar and makes it accessible on Ethereum. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, its price will not easily depeg since it is overcollateralized. Smart contracts on the system are checked and certified by Certik which gives users more security. Despite Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) token burn, it is still unable to keep its value and the price now shows below some important support levels. In comparison, a new project called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking off, as it collected $10.1 million from over 11,700 investors during its presale and today is priced at $0.03 which could mean a 100% yield on investment after launch. Due to its modern lending methods and smart contracts confirmed by Certik, more DeFi fans are finding Mutuum Finance attractive. As SHIB is still recovering, people searching for good alternatives to invest in 2025 might like to learn about MUTM’s positive traits and chances of success For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below: Website: https://mutuum.com/ Linktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-08 17:30:00

Sonic ( S ) price crashed to $0.3775 on Sunday, down by over 61% from its highest point this year. This crash has brought its market capitalization to $1.9 billion, down from $3.15 billion in January. Sonic token has plunged as its ecosystem continues slowing down. Data shows that the stablecoin market cap has plunged to $446 million, down from $597 million earlier this year. A falling stablecoin supply in a chain signals that activity in the network is fading. You might also like: Chart of the week: Solana indicators point north, bulls test $165 target Further data shows that Sonic’s total value locked in its decentralized finance has plunged from nearly $2 billion in May to $1.53 billion. Most of this weakness was driven by outflows from AAVE, Sio Finance, Pendle, and MEV Capital, which have shed over 10% in assets in the last 30 days. This slowdown means Sonic is not making as much money as it did a few months ago. Its daily chain revenue dropped to $9,600 on Saturday from a record high of over $42,000 in May. Sonic token has also dropped as the funding rate across all exchanges has turned negative in the past few months. Santiment data shows that the funding rate fell to 0.05% on Saturday, its lowest point in over a week. A falling funding rate signals that investors anticipate its future price to be lower than the spot one. Sonic crypto price technical analysis S price chart | Source: crypto.news The 12-hour chart shows that the S price has been in a free fall in the past few weeks. It plunged to a low of $0.3810, a key level that coincided with the lowest swing in April. This price was also the neckline of the double-top pattern at $0.6185. A double-top is one of the most popular bearish signs in technical analysis. The Sonic token has remained below the 50-period moving average, while oscillators point downwards. Therefore, it will likely continue falling as sellers target the support all-time low of $0.3151, its lowest point in February.

The fully regulated exchange claims the CFTC has jurisdiction over its sports contracts, not the gaming board. The lawsuit claims the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) is acting beyond the scope of its jurisdiction. NGCB Improperly Bans Sports Event Contracts Business associates of Crypto.com’s North American derivatives business, North American Derivatives Exchange, Inc., sued the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB), alleging the board impeded Crypto.com from offering “derivative contracts that reference sporting events on its federally regulated market.” In a lawsuit filed on June 3, 2025, the exchange asserts that the NGCB asserted jurisdiction by mistaking that contracts traded on Crypto.com constitute “wagering” on sporting events according to the state’s gaming laws. The lawsuit details: “Nevada has purported to assert jurisdiction over CDNA, a federally regulated designated contract market (“DCM”), on the mistaken premise that contracts traded on the DCM constitute “wagering on sporting events” subject to Nevada gaming laws.” In its lawsuit the exchange argues that federal law, the Commodity Exchange Act in this regard, affords the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sole jurisdiction over these events. Federal Law Prevails Crypto.com asserts that the state of Nevada’s gaming commission acted beyond its jurisdiction. In an excerpt of the lawsuit, the exchange claims: “NGCB has no authority to regulate, let alone prohibit, derivatives trading offered by a federally regulated DCM [designated contract market] operating pursuant to federal law.” The exchange challenged Nevada state-level governance, taking issue with its interference with a federally regulated platform. Crypto.com and several other exchanges are federally regulated and report to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The June 3 lawsuit cites two recent federal injunctions involving KalshiEX, a predictions marketplace, where courts found that state gaming boards in Nevada and New Jersey (New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement) could not interfere in federally approved event contracts. Bloomberg reported in March 2025, KalshiEX said the following over Nevada’s attempted state-level interference: “Nevada’s attempt to regulate Kalshi intrudes upon the federal regulatory framework that Congress established for regulating futures derivatives on designated exchanges.” KalshiEX’s lawsuit specified: “The Commodity Exchange Act explicitly and unambiguously delegates the ‘exclusive’ power to oversee, approve, and regulate futures trading on registered exchanges to a federal agency – the CFTC.” Kalshi’s lawsuit came after Nevada and New Jersey regulators issued cease-and-desist orders instructing it to stop sports contracts.

With price action breaking a key descending trendline on the 4-hour chart and holding gains around $2.21, short-term traders are eyeing the possibility of a bullish recovery as June 10 approaches. What’s Happening With XRP’s Price? On the weekly chart, XRP price today is trading around $2.21 after bouncing off the mid-range of its Fibonacci retracement zone. The price has rebounded over 7% from its local low of $2.06, retesting a declining resistance trendline for the third time. This level coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci zone, suggesting a critical juncture where bulls must hold ground for further upside.

A lower-than-expected inflation figure could pressure the bank to cut interest rates. Some of the top coins to watch will be Flare ( FLR ), Aptos ( APT ), and Pi Network ( PI ). Flare Flare is a fast-growing layer-1 network whose token is valued at over $1 billion. It will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks tokens worth over $35 million on Monday. In addition, its ecosystem is experiencing strong growth, with the total value locked at $188 million, up from $51 million in January. Also, its stablecoin market cap has jumped to $150 million from $5.2 million in May. The daily chart shows that the FLR token has pulled back in the past few weeks, moving from a high of $0.02220, to $0.018. It has formed a falling wedge, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, it will likely have a bullish breakout, with the target being at $0.0220. Flare price chart | Source: crypto.news Aptos Aptos, a top layer-1 blockchain network, will be in focus this week as it unlocks tokens worth $53 million, equivalent to 1.8% of its float. Also, the market cap of all stablecoins in the network has jumped to a record high of $1.32 billion. APT token has been in a strong downtrend in the past few days, forming a descending channel. It has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have moved downwards. Aptos token will likely remain in this range, and possibly bounce back to the upper side of the range at $6. A drop below the lower side of the channel will point to further downside to $3.5.

These patterns are often followed by a bullish breakout, which may happen this week.

Deutscher, who claimed that he could predict when the altcoin season would start thanks to the artificial intelligence model he developed, stated that he tested this model by comparing it with previous cycles and that the results were “surprising.” Deutscher recalled that the altcoin seasons in 2017 and 2021 offered increases of 1,000% to 10,000%, and said that such major movements have not yet been seen in the current cycle. He noted that apart from the partial increases experienced in April and November-December of last year, major altcoins generally performed poorly against Bitcoin. According to the analyst, there are several key reasons why this cycle is different from previous periods: Macroeconomic Conditions: While the pandemic-induced stimulus packages in the 2020-2021 period provided serious liquidity to the crypto market, this situation has been reversed in the current environment with the FED's balance sheet reduction policies. Institutional Bitcoin Investments: Bitcoin ETFs and the entry of giants like BlackRock are keeping capital in Bitcoin, which is leading to a weakening of the “capital flow from Bitcoin to altcoins” effect seen in previous cycles. Ethereum’s Weak Performance: Ethereum’s failure to make a strong breakout against Bitcoin is preventing the start of a large-scale altcoin rally. Low Individual Interest: Scandals such as UST, FTX and the losses experienced in the recent memecoin frenzy caused individual investors to move away from the market. Related News: Crypto Users Beware: Hackers' New Methods Have Emerged - What Steps Are Necessary to Prevent the Loss of All Assets? Miles Deutscher stated that the model called Altcoin Rally Score (ARS), which he developed by taking this data into account, consists of four basic indicators that will trigger the altcoin season: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin dominance must fall below 60% and show a decline of 4 points in the 21-day period. Ethereum's Leadership: The ETH/BTC ratio must break above the 200-day moving average and make a new 90-day high. Altcoin Seasonal Index: If this index rises above 40 and rises for two consecutive weeks, it will indicate a broad-based rally. Trends and Individual Interest: Market sentiment, trend momentum, and stablecoin liquidity should show a positive trend. Deutscher predicts that the new altcoin season, which he defines as 3.0, will be shorter and more selective (sector-based) than previous cycles. He cited both the global liquidity crunch and the fact that the supply of newly released altcoins is much higher than in previous years as the main reasons for this. *This is not investment advice.
