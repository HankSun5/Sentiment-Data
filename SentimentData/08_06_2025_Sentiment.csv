45656340,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107104,1749332559,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Ether Outshines BTC & XRP Institutional Products Following $321 Million Pump,https://zycrypto.com/ether-outshines-btc-xrp-institutional-products-following-321-million-pump/,"Crypto investment products recorded $286 million net inflows, with Ether leading the pack while Bitcoin (BTC) picked up losses. The New York court decision on President Trump’s tariff plan boosted investor sentiment mid-week. Last week’s fund flows highlighted a slight geographical shift, although the United States remained dominant due to institutional demand. A String Of Consecutive Weekly Inflows The digital asset market remains bullish following recent global institutional investment. A recent CoinShares Fund Flows shows a $286 million inflow, marking the seventh consecutive weekly gain. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, saw swift exits, recording $8 million outflows. Bitcoin started the week in the green zone on the heels of institutional accumulation but lost steam after a New York court decided on recent White House tariffs. Still, Bitcoin price trades within the $106k zone, though down from its $111k all-time high. Bulls are optimistic due to publicly-listed firms acquiring the assets. Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased 705 BTC on Monday, taking holdings to 580,955 BTC. Although the buy was the smallest in several weeks, Strategy bolstered wider interest. Japanese Metaplanet also scooped up more assets in the same period. Meanwhile, Ether was the highest gainer last week as institutional funds attracted a massive $321 million. This brings the figure for the last six weeks to $1.19 billion as investors remain keen on an altcoin resurgence. Monthly figures are now up to $889 million while assets under management jumped above $14 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States also notched gains within the week. Last month, the general spike in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities was a major ETH driver. This string of bullish inflows marks the highest Ether run since December 2024. XRP Loses Institutional Momentum Per the data, XRP shed $28 million in the last seven days, stretching monthly losses, while year-to-date figures remain in the green zone. XRP saw huge gains earlier this year on the back of an expected spot ETF approval, but lost momentum after delayed decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Odds are still in favor for an approval this year. “ Regionally, investor focus shifted somewhat away from the US, which still recorded inflows of US$199m last week. Germany and Australia saw inflows of US$42.9m and US$21.5m, respectively. Meanwhile, Hong Kong experienced its strongest weekly post-seed inflows since the launch of exchange-traded products just over a year ago, totalling US$54.8 million.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-07 21:42:39

Dogecoin (DOGE), the iconic meme-turned-mainstay, is trading at around $0.19 a far cry from its rumored $5 price target, yet analysts still forecast a more grounded move toward $0.78 by year’s end. While DOGE banks on community loyalty and potential ETF exposure, a new altcoin is starting to dominate the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With whispers of a 44x ROI potential, MUTM is quickly becoming a top contender for those wondering what crypto to invest in before the next market surge. Dogecoin Targets $5 as 2025 Heats Up Even through market ups and downs, Dogecoin (DOGE), remains one of the most notable cryptocurrencies to look at. DOGE is trading around $0.195 in June 2025 and due to its strong fan base, previous volatility and possible upswing, people are discussing how it might hit the $5 mark. Even though many think DOGE will stay around $0.80 in the near term, some enthusiasts believe that the introduction of crypto ETFs, updated laws and a revival in the retail market will launch another huge rally. Investors are talking a lot lately about the best crypto to acquire now and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is joining the conversation as a coin with great potential. MUTM’s Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale, following a sell-out of Phase 4. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 3 investors upon the token’s launch. With over $10.1 million raised and a growing community of 11,700+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway —each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens in recognition of their foundational role in the project. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key pillars of the ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of Mutuum Finance. Dogecoin and Mutuum Finance are both gaining attention in 2025, but for very different reasons. DOGE, sitting around $0.19, still benefits from its strong community and the hope of another breakout—though most analysts see it more realistically reaching $0.78 by year’s end. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a newer DeFi project offering real use cases and strong growth potential. It’s already raised over $10.1 million and attracted more than 11,700 investors. At $0.03 per token in Phase 5 of its presale, early buyers could see a 2x return at launch—and possibly much more if growth continues. For those looking ahead, MUTM might be the more practical pick.

Amid the current price action, crypto analyst Decode has provided insights into whether the leading crypto will rally to $120,000 or drop below $100,000 next. Analyst Reveals What’s Next For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Decode shared an accompanying chart in which he made an ABC wave analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, the leading crypto is expected to drop below $100,000 before it rallies to a new ATH of $120,000. The chart showed that BTC could fall to as low as $96,500 on the Wave B corrective move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next This drop to $96,500 is expected to happen this month. Once that is done, Decode predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally above $120,500 before the end of July. This will mark the Wave C impulsive move to the upside. This aligns with veteran trader Peter Brandt’s prediction that BTC could reach as high as $150,000 by late summer. However, crypto analyst KillaXBT has predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit the $120,000 target by mid-June. This coincides with the June FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18. A Fed rate cut could serve as the catalyst for such a parabolic rally from the current BTC price level. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 97.4% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged. As such, market participants aren’t expecting a rate cut, which is why the Bitcoin price could pump massively if Jerome Powell and the FOMC were to surprise everyone. Moreover, US President Donald Trump yesterday urged the Fed to cut rates by a full point. A Breakout Might Be On The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that a breakout could be imminent for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is progressing inside a 4-hour falling wedge, which indicates a bullish reversal pattern. If confirmed, the analyst stated that the breakout could target the $107,500 and $109,500 zones, which are the Fibonacci confluence areas. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the solid V-shape recovery for the Bitcoin price after the leading crypto dropped to as low as $100,000 on May 5. However, the analyst noted that BTC’s rebound back to the $105,000 zone won’t matter until it breaks above the $106,800 level. The leading crypto must also show actual follow-through with 3-day to 1-week closes to support a breakout. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,000. Up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

45656719,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70232,1749333628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Cardano’s (ADA) Unsteady Momentum Opens the Door for Ruvi AI (RUVI), Is This the Next Bull Run Leader?",https://timestabloid.com/cardanos-ada-unsteady-momentum-opens-the-door-for-ruvi-ai/,"Cardano has long been hailed as one of the most promising blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency industry. Its methodical development and focus on scalability earned it a loyal following. However, recent market trends suggest Cardano’s momentum is slowing, leaving room for emerging projects like Ruvi AI to take the spotlight. With its robust technology and growing investor interest, Ruvi AI appears set to lead the next bull run. Here’s why. Ruvi AI’s Presale Is Off to an Explosive Start Unlike Cardano, which is grappling with its next growth phase, Ruvi AI is surging forward with an immensely successful Phase 2 presale . To date, the project has raised $1.5 million and sold nearly 135 million tokens , signaling strong investor confidence and excitement. At a remarkably low entry price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI’s presale is designed for accessibility and growth. What sets this presale apart is its $0.07 valuation upon conclusion , a programmed feature rather than mere speculation. Analysts further project a $1 valuation post-listing , emphasizing Ruvi AI’s potential for astronomical returns. Early investors are seizing the opportunity to get in before prices climb steeply. Real-World Applications That Solve Big Problems While Cardano has focused on establishing a strong technical foundation, Ruvi AI is leveraging its integration of AI and blockchain technology to tackle real-world challenges across multiple industries. These tangible solutions set Ruvi AI apart and broaden its appeal: Healthcare : Ruvi AI bolsters patient care with advanced diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows, reducing inefficiencies while ensuring better outcomes. Logistics : The platform optimizes supply chain operations, saving businesses time and money while enhancing delivery efficiency. Finance : With cutting-edge fraud detection systems, Ruvi AI offers enhanced safety and efficiency in financial networks. These use cases ensure Ruvi AI isn’t just another speculative token. It’s delivering practical advancements that make a measurable difference, positioning it for sustainable growth and adoption. Cardano’s Challenges Could Be Ruvi AI’s Opportunity Despite its strengths, Cardano has faced significant hurdles as it tries to maintain investor trust and expand its ecosystem. Critics point to delays in delivering updates and projects, which have raised questions about its momentum and ability to compete with newer players. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, benefits from being in its early stages, with the advantage of executing a clearly defined and transparent roadmap. By focusing on immediate deliverables and securing major milestones like its first exchange partnership , Ruvi AI is creating a strong launchpad for future growth. Rewarding Investors with VIP Tiers To encourage participation during its presale, Ruvi AI offers a rewarding VIP investment tier system , maximizing returns for early supporters. Here’s how the numbers stack up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers not only reward investor confidence but also strengthen Ruvi AI’s ability to attract serious backers who believe in its long-term potential. Why Ruvi AI Is Positioned as a Leader in the Next Bull Run Ruvi AI has all the makings of a standout project in the cryptocurrency space. Its ability to address real-world needs, coupled with its successful presale structure, builds a solid case for sustained growth. Cardano’s slower momentum opens the door wide for Ruvi AI to step in and become a leader in the next bull run. What makes Ruvi AI particularly appealing is the timing of its presale. With a low buy-in price and an already-built roadmap for value growth, it offers a rare chance to invest in a project before its breakout success. The $1 valuation analysts forecast after listing could be just the beginning.

Certain projects are separating themselves from the crowd with meaningful upgrades, strategic partnerships, and investor attention. While much of the market remains range-bound, a handful of cryptocurrencies are showing technical strength and fundamental development that signal possible outperformance in the near term. In this guide, we highlight four good cryptos to buy now, based on their unique market positions and upcoming catalysts. These include presale momentum, platform-wide upgrades, and renewed institutional interest. BlockDAG, Sonic, NEAR, and BNB are all good options as each project is navigating current conditions with a clear roadmap, and the potential upside in the coming months is drawing growing attention from analysts and traders alike. 1. BlockDAG – Final Presale Window Before GO LIVE Reveal BlockDAG continues to stand out as one of the most talked-about projects of the year. With more than $288.5 million raised and 22 billion BDAG coins sold so far, it’s nearing the conclusion of its presale at a price of $0.0018, which will remain in place until June 13. On that day, the GO LIVE reveal is scheduled, announcing 20 upcoming exchange launches. For early buyers, $1,000 still secures over 555,000 coins, with a projected listing target of $0.05. The conversation has already shifted toward the possibility of a $0.25 valuation soon. From a technical perspective, BlockDAG uses a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work consensus model, optimizing for scalability and energy efficiency. It currently has over 1.5 million mobile users on the X1 app, which allows easy mobile mining without any effort or cost. Analysts are bullish about BlockDAG’s future, with some pointing at future predictions as high as $10. With fundamentals and presale economics aligned, BlockDAG stands as one of the best-positioned contenders when evaluating good crypto to buy now. 2. Sonic – Airdrop Engagement and Strategic Investment Fuel Momentum Sonic is making significant waves in Q2 of 2025. Trading near $0.406 with a market cap of approximately $1.17 billion, its ecosystem has gained serious momentum in the wake of a 200 million token airdrop. The distribution structure favors long-term commitment, unlocking 25% upfront and the remainder over 270 days, reducing short-term sell pressure and reinforcing project stability. Sonic also secured a $10 million strategic investment from Galaxy Digital, intended to expand its presence in the U.S. and strengthen its DeFi stack. A confirmed listing on Kraken earlier in May added to its visibility. The project, formerly Fantom, is rebranding and restructuring, which is helping to reinforce its long-term relevance. From a price action standpoint, Sonic is approaching a key breakout level at $0.41. A confirmed move above this could flip resistance into a new support zone. With investor incentives, institutional backing, and a growing user base, Sonic presents itself as a good crypto to buy now, especially heading into the next quarter. 3. Near Protocol – Network Growth and ETF Catalysts Boost Market Outlook NEAR Protocol is showing strong usage metrics and technical recovery. Priced around $2.55 with a market cap exceeding $3.1 billion, NEAR has processed more than 40 million transactions in just the past week. This puts it alongside Solana and Tron among the most active blockchain platforms, a testament to increasing developer and user engagement. The next evolution for the network is the rollout of Nightshade 2.0, its sharding upgrade scheduled for the end of 2025. At the same time, ETF speculation is heating up. Bitwise has filed for a NEAR-backed ETF, potentially opening the door to institutional capital and mainstream adoption. Technically, NEAR is trading above its 9-day exponential moving average, and resistance is sitting at $2.73. A sustained break beyond this level would strengthen the bullish trend. Given its combination of strong fundamentals, potential regulatory catalysts, and price setup, NEAR makes a strong case as a good crypto to buy now in a forward-looking portfolio. 4. Binance Coin – Legal Resolution and Network Upgrades Drive Confidence Binance Coin (BNB) is currently priced at $671.63 and has rebounded strongly following a pivotal legal development. In late May, the SEC officially dismissed its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, removing a significant overhang that had affected sentiment for over two years. With that chapter closed, attention has returned to the platform’s innovation and performance. The Lorentz Hard Fork, launched in May, doubled the throughput of the BNB Chain and introduced AI-integrated smart contracts. These upgrades are positioning BNB Chain as a more dynamic environment for decentralized applications. Additionally, VanEck has filed for a spot BNB ETF, signaling renewed institutional interest. Technical indicators show support around $654, with near-term targets between $730 and $801. With legal risk out of the way and infrastructure getting smarter, BNB has returned to the radar as a good crypto to buy now for both retail and institutional players aiming to re-engage with top-tier platforms. Final Analysis: Which Projects Have the Strongest Setup Right Now? In a market filled with thousands of options, very few cryptocurrencies combine technical innovation, user activity, and upcoming catalysts as effectively as BlockDAG, Sonic, NEAR, and Binance Coin. Whether you are evaluating entry points based on presale potential, institutional involvement, or network activity, each of these projects stands out in its category. BlockDAG offers one of the final low-cost buying windows ahead of its GO LIVE reveal. Sonic is ramping up visibility through airdrops and capital inflows. NEAR has entered the ETF conversation and is processing volumes that few chains can match. BNB, now free from legal pressure, is upgrading at a pace that restores confidence. These are not just speculative bets. They are grounded in development, backed by metrics, and structured for future performance. As you assess good crypto to buy now for your 2025 strategy, this group deserves close and ongoing attention.

The size and timing of the transfer have sparked intense speculation: is this part of a broader institutional strategy, a liquidity shuffle, or something more strategic? As Ripple’s activity draws attention, XRP’s price movement is beginning to reflect cautious optimism. With bulls eyeing a breakout past key resistance, this development could mark the beginning of a new phase—not just for XRP, but for other altcoins as well. XRP Shows Steady Climb, Eyeing $2.48 as Bulls Struggle to Break Resistance Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.05 and $2.33, showing slight growth in the past week. Bulls are attempting to push past the $2.48 resistance level. However, they're finding it challenging. The price has risen modestly by around 2% in the past week and month. The Relative Strength Index sits around 57, indicating a potential upward push yet not overbought. If XRP breaks through the current resistance, it might climb towards the $2.76 mark, which is a sizeable increase from its current position. But for now, the momentum remains sluggish, with the bulls needing more strength to achieve significant growth beyond the modest percentage increases of late. Conclusion While Ripple’s $487 million XRP transfer has yet to reveal its true intent, the market’s reaction hints at growing anticipation. If XRP can overcome the stubborn $2.48 barrier, it could set the stage for a rally toward $2.76 and beyond. Investors are now watching closely—not only to decode Ripple’s next move but also to identify which altcoins might ride the wave of renewed momentum.

As regulators weigh the risks and rewards, Ethereum stands out as a strong candidate to lead this institutional wave. Could ETH be the first crypto to benefit from UK-based ETNs—and what might this mean for the broader market? This article explores the implications of this regulatory pivot and which assets may benefit most from the coming changes. Ethereum Shows Mixed Signals: Bulls and Bears in Tug-of-War Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading between $2410 and $2729.90. While recent movements show slight bearish pressure with a weekly drop of over 1%, the coin has surged by around 38% over the past month. This hints at potential growth, though the path isn't clear-cut. If bulls regain strength, the price might test the next resistance at about $2920. If it can break past that, $3240 is the following target. These changes could mean an increase of over 10% and then around 18%. However, if bears take control, Ethereum might drop to support levels, but the upward momentum in the monthly trend gives hope for future gains. Conclusion The UK's move toward allowing crypto ETNs could mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the digital asset space at large. Despite short-term price fluctuations, ETH's long-term trajectory may receive a powerful boost from institutional demand and broader market access. If Ethereum breaks through key resistance levels, the momentum could extend beyond ETH—benefiting a wider range of altcoins poised to thrive in a more regulated, investment-friendly environment.

While investors watched the carmaker's valuation crumble, a handful of lesser-known altcoins began catching their eye, not just as alternatives, but as assets thriving on the very principles of decentralization the feud highlighted. These hidden gems are now poised for growth, offering promising opportunities for investors looking to move beyond the politically-charged volatility of traditional stocks. Graphite Network Rolls Out Reputation-Led Infrastructure to Reinvent Blockchain Trust Tesla’s nosedive after Trump–Musk row revealed a deeper flaw in how financial markets operate. Billions wiped out, not because of product failures or structural flaws, but because two powerful personalities clashed. This is what happens when trust isn’t engineered into the system. Graphite Network was built to solve exactly this kind of chaos. It does not rely on personalities, but rather it uses verifiable execution . Imagine a credit score that shows precisely what data was used, where it came from, and how it was processed. That’s the kind of transparency Graphite Network brings to every corner of its ecosystem. A Blockchain Where Trust Is the Default Setting In contrast to legacy systems where trust is patched on as an afterthought, Graphite Network bakes it in from the start: Reputation-based architecture: Your Trust Score evolves based on optional KYC (via zero-knowledge proofs), account history, and behavior. Higher trust means better experiences. Custom filters and tagged wallets: Want to interact only with verified users? Set your parameters and go. Trust becomes programmable. Zero drama, zero fraud: Transparency and accountability are coded into the network itself. Decentralized Earning For Every Node Graphite Network is both secure and inclusive. It is the first network to enable all node types to earn directly from the blockchain, opening income opportunities across the board. It’s a more sustainable and equitable future for decentralized infrastructure. Built on the Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 consensus, Graphite Network eliminates congestion, slashes energy costs, and reduces common attack vectors. Plus, it’s EVM-compatible, making it a breeze for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and dApps without friction. While Tesla’s value can swing on a tweet, Graphite Network is building a system where trust doesn’t fluctuate — it compounds. Learn More about Graphite Network Curve DAO Token (CRV) on the Verge of a Major Breakout Curve DAO Token (CRV) is currently trading between sixty-one and seventy-eight cents. Bulls are showing signs of weakness. The price is struggling to break through the nearest resistance of eighty-eight cents. However, with a Relative Strength Index slightly below fifty-seven, there's some room for upward motion. Bears are still in the mix, especially with a six-month drop of over forty-five percent. Short-term averages suggest a balanced viewpoint, with ten-day and hundred-day moving averages around sixty-five cents. If bulls regain strength, CRV could rise to the second resistance level of one dollar and five cents—a potential increase of over fifty percent from its lower range. Mantle (MNT) Eyes 18% Rally as Bulls Prepare to Charge Mantle (MNT) is currently trading between $0.65 and $0.73, suggesting cautious market sentiment. The bulls tried lifting Mantle but faced resistance near $0.78, while bears managed to push it towards a support line around $0.61. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at over 77 indicates Mantle is overbought, hinting at a possible pullback. A significant hurdle remains near $0.86, offering almost 18% potential growth if broken. However, the dropping trend over the past six months, with a nearly 48% decrease, signals ongoing pressure from bears. While short-term pushes might happen, steady growth needs stronger bull momentum to challenge the bears' hold. Conclusion Ultimately, the market turbulence sparked by the Trump-Musk feud does more than just damage stocks like Tesla; it sharply highlights the core value proposition of the crypto space. This environment presents a clear divergence in opportunity: on one hand, foundational projects like Graphite Network are building a new, trust-based infrastructure immune to such drama. On the other, established tokens like CRV and Mantle offer immediate, albeit volatile, trading scenarios for savvy investors. As the dust settles, it’s clear that whether one seeks to build a new financial future or capitalize on the present, the crypto market offers compelling answers to the chaos of the old guard.

This weekend, the focus shifts from Tesla's feud-related troubles to the opportunities it has created in crypto, with four specific coins showing strong potential for growth. These tokens, which demonstrated unique advantages during the political storm, have become standout options for investors. Discover which cryptocurrencies might surge ahead as this captivating saga unfolds. When Opinion Leaders Crash Value, Graphite Offers Trust That Doesn’t Wobble In a landscape where markets still react more to personality than performance, Graphite Network is building a blockchain where reputation is earned by verifiable action . It’s a bold reimagining of digital trust: structural, measurable, and immune to manipulation. Graphite Network runs on the Polymer 2.0 Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain, capable of processing 1,400 transactions per second with consistent, predictable fees. That places it firmly in competition with traditional finance systems in terms of throughput and reliability, while offering the decentralization and auditability TradFi lacks. Beyond just optimizing speed, Graphite Network is redesigning the trust layer. One Account, One Reputation: A Clean Slate for Blockchain Identity Graphite Network enforces a one-account-per-user model via a setup fee paid in $@G, its native token . This model creates a powerful deterrent to spam, simplifies counterparty due diligence, and builds a cleaner, more accountable user base. At the heart of this identity layer is the Trust Score system that evaluates users based on behavioral signals: Transaction history KYC status (optional, but rewarded) Interactions with other verified accounts For decentralized apps, this system enables risk-aware user filtering, empowering platforms and users to set their own thresholds for trust. Graphite Network Bets Big on Reputation-Led Blockchain in 2025 When volatility has again exposed the emotional core of financial markets, Graphite Network is advancing a different thesis: that trust, if structurally embedded, can outperform hype. The core of its 2025 roadmap is a push to operationalize reputation as infrastructure where Layer-2 solutions will blur the line between blockchain and behavioral credibility. Among its flagship rollouts: Phonebook Reputation MVP: A decentralized ID model linking Trust Scores to phone numbers via smart contracts. The goal is to allow users to evaluate counterparty risk in real-time using a phone number as a proxy for on-chain trustworthiness. Hotspot Bundle Initiative: A hardware-software package designed to onboard remote and underbanked populations into the Graphite ecosystem. Participants will be able to operate nodes and earn income, effectively lowering the barrier to Web3 participation. Geo Game Powered by DePIN: An educational gaming product simulating real-world macro conditions such as inflation and resource scarcity. Users will interact with on-chain economies in a controlled, gamified environment. Graphite Network brings the blockchain one step closer to real-world usability: a trusted, intuitive environment for everyone — from everyday users to enterprise builders. Learn More about Graphite Network Pyth Network (PYTH) Targets 36% Rally as Bearish Pressure Fades Source: tradingview Pyth Network's price hovers between eleven and fourteen cents, showing a slight bullish trend. With the current increase over the past week of over 4%, bulls are trying to regain control. However, the price has fallen significantly since six months ago. The nearest resistance sits at sixteen cents. If it breaks through, the next target is nineteen cents, a potential rise of around 36% from the lower end of its current range. The RSI is just above mid-point, hinting at possible upward momentum, but the mixed past performance suggests cautious optimism for further growth. Algorand (ALGO) Breakout Imminent, Poised for 50% Upswing Source: tradingview Algorand's price hovers between eighteen and twenty-two cents. Bulls and bears are equally matched, with a relative strength index near fifty-five. The current price sits at its simple moving average, hinting at indecision. Resistance at twenty-four cents blocks upward moves, while support at sixteen cents provides a safety net. If optimism returns, Algorand could see a modest rise to twenty-four cents, a gain of over ten percent. Pushing past this, the next target is twenty-eight cents, a climb of over fifty percent from current levels. However, recent performance is gloomy, with prices down over sixty percent in six months, reflecting market challenges. Celestia (TIA) Set for 30% Recovery Rally as Bulls Step In Source: tradingview Celestia (TIA) is currently hovering between two and three dollars. It shows a weak bullish presence. Recent drops of over five percent in one week and nearly seventeen percent in a month indicate bearish pressure. Despite this, there's a potential for growth if bulls regain control. The coin might aim for the first resistance near three dollars. This would mean a rise of over thirty percent from the lower end of its current range. However, with a six-month loss of more than seventy-five percent, recovery might take time. Overall, Celestia remains at the mercy of both bulls and bears looking to tip the scale. Conclusion One path is a long-term, fundamental investment in a trust-based solution like Graphite Network, designed to be immune to such drama. The other is a short-term, tactical trade on the recovery of volatile tokens like Pyth Network, Algorand, and Celestia.

Their feud over the 'Big Beautiful Bill' became an unexpected marketing campaign for Bitcoin and has stirred up significant excitement around two specific altcoins that thrived on the chaos. Curious about which digital currencies are poised for a breakout fueled by this political drama? This article unpacks the recent events and reveals key insights into the potential market movers. Bitcoin's Bullish Surge Continues with Sights Set on $121k Target Source: tradingview Bitcoin currently fluctuates between $102,410 and almost $110,000, showing strong bullish control despite some resistance. The nearest challenge for bulls lies just above $114,000. If momentum continues, Bitcoin could aim for just over $121,600, a potential growth of roughly 12% from current levels. Support remains at around $99,000, giving investors confidence in a strong base. The 10-day and 100-day averages stay close, around $105,000, indicating stability. Bitcoin's RSI suggests it's not overly bought, pointing to room for growth. The recent one-month rise of about 9% highlights potential for further gains, indicating bears are currently held at bay. Ethereum Poised for Explosive Growth, Targets $3240 Source: tradingview Ethereum's price hovers between $2410 and $2729.90, showing slight bullish strength with recent gains of nearly 39% over the past month. However, a minor dip of less than 1% this week suggests some hesitation. The bulls seem slightly weak as they need to push past the $2920 resistance to gain momentum. If Ethereum breaks this level, it could climb over 18% more to approach the $3240 mark. Support is firmly set at about $2280, offering a safety net. Current analysis shows potential for growth, but the market waits to see if bulls can overcome these hurdles and surge past existing resistances.

The key takeaway is that the chaos creates distinct opportunities: to ride the momentum of established leaders or to invest in the foundations of a more stable future.

Sui (SUI) Poised for Significant Climb as Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Sui (SUI) is trading between $3.02 and $3.71, with the bulls and bears both having moments. Its nearest resistance is just over $4, while support lingers under $3. Sui has been stable, with a slight weekly gain but a small monthly dip. Its price has dropped over the past six months. However, the current indicators suggest room for a potential climb. If Sui breaks through the $4 barrier, it might head towards close to $5, marking a potential rise of over a quarter in percentage terms. Keep an eye on the support levels to gauge any possible downward shifts.

Learn More about Graphite Network Raydium (RAY) Primed for 20% Surge from Deep Value Zone Source: tradingview Raydium (RAY) is struggling to break free from a bearish trend. The current price hovers between low twos and a little over three dollars, hinting at weak momentum. The token's value has dipped by over 11% this week and more than 12% this month, revealing bearish control. With support at around one-seventy-four and resistance at just under four dollars, bulls seem weak. Raydium needs to surpass the first barrier to catch some upward momentum. If they succeed, prices could rise by about 20% to the next resistance near four-eighty, unlocking growth potential. However, with indicators pointing to sluggish strength, uncertainty reigns for now. Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for a potential 'Big Beautiful Rebound' this weekend, it's clear the path to recovery is paved with diverse opportunities. The options range from technical plays like Sui, which shows potential for a climb, to high-risk turnarounds like Raydium, which could surge if bullish momentum returns. Contrasting these is Graphite Network, which offers less a weekend trade and more a long-term investment in a future where market value is built on verifiable trust, not personality feuds. Whether investors are looking for a short-term price surge or a long-term structural solution, this weekend's potential recovery has a contender for every portfolio.

Top 3 Coins on Our Radar,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/the-weekend-outlook-will-a-political-ceasefire-ignite-a-fire-in-the-crypto-markets-top-3-coins-on-our-radar,"As the dust settles on a week dominated by the bitter clash between Trump and Musk, the crypto market is coiled for a potentially explosive weekend. All eyes are now on a potential reconciliation, as a political ceasefire between the two titans could be the spark needed for a significant market-wide rally. With this high-stakes narrative in play, the focus now turns to the key digital assets poised for potential gains. Readers can dive deeper to uncover the top three contenders set to capture the market's attention. Stacks (STX) Primed for 50% Jump as Reversal Gains Traction Source: tradingview Stacks (STX) is currently navigating a challenging period, with its price range hovering between about seventy cents and nearly ninety cents. The coin struggles to gain momentum, with bulls appearing weak as indicated by recent drops of over twelve percent in the past week and almost twenty-seven percent in the last month. The RSI indicates a neutral zone, signaling indecision. The nearest resistance sits just under a dollar, while support is closer to the high fifties in cents. Despite a steep decline of about seventy-six percent over six months, if bulls regain strength, a climb past the dollar mark could translate to roughly a fifty percent jump from its lower current price. Graphite Network Rolls Out Reputation-Led Infrastructure to Reinvent Blockchain Trust Tesla’s nosedive after Trump–Musk row revealed a deeper flaw in how financial markets operate. Billions wiped out, not because of product failures or structural flaws, but because two powerful personalities clashed. This is what happens when trust isn’t engineered into the system. Graphite Network was built to solve exactly this kind of chaos. It does not rely on personalities, but rather it uses verifiable execution . Imagine a credit score that shows precisely what data was used, where it came from, and how it was processed. That’s the kind of transparency Graphite Network brings to every corner of its ecosystem. A Blockchain Where Trust Is the Default Setting In contrast to legacy systems where trust is patched on as an afterthought, Graphite Network bakes it in from the start: Reputation-based architecture: Your Trust Score evolves based on optional KYC (via zero-knowledge proofs), account history, and behavior. Higher trust means better experiences. Custom filters and tagged wallets: Want to interact only with verified users? Set your parameters and go. Trust becomes programmable. Zero drama, zero fraud: Transparency and accountability are coded into the network itself. Decentralized Earning For Every Node Graphite Network is both secure and inclusive. It is the first network to enable all node types to earn directly from the blockchain, opening income opportunities across the board. It’s a more sustainable and equitable future for decentralized infrastructure. Built on the Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 consensus, Graphite Network eliminates congestion, slashes energy costs, and reduces common attack vectors. Plus, it’s EVM-compatible, making it a breeze for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and dApps without friction. While Tesla’s value can swing on a tweet, Graphite Network is building a system where trust doesn’t fluctuate — it compounds. Learn More about Graphite Network Pyth Network (PYTH) Targets 36% Rally as Bearish Pressure Fades Source: tradingview Pyth Network's price hovers between eleven and fourteen cents, showing a slight bullish trend. With the current increase over the past week of over 4%, bulls are trying to regain control. However, the price has fallen significantly since six months ago. The nearest resistance sits at sixteen cents. If it breaks through, the next target is nineteen cents, a potential rise of around 36% from the lower end of its current range. The RSI is just above mid-point, hinting at possible upward momentum, but the mixed past performance suggests cautious optimism for further growth. Conclusion As the market anticipates a rally from a potential Trump-Musk ""ceasefire,"" the opportunities presented are twofold. For traders looking to ride the immediate wave, Stacks (STX) offers a high-risk turnaround play, while Pyth Network (PYTH) shows early signs of bullish momentum. For those looking beyond the weekend trade, Graphite Network provides a fundamental solution, aiming to build a future immune to the very political drama driving the speculation. Ultimately, whether you trade the spark or invest in the fireproof shelter, this weekend offers a clear strategic choice. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While Tesla crumbled under the political pressure, the crypto market demonstrated remarkable resilience, shaking off the turbulence from the high-profile feud . In this exploration, we'll look beyond the noise to reveal how this event became an advertisement for decentralization and why three specific coins are now poised for significant gains, positioned to become the potential stars of the market’s next big rally. Optimism (OP) Surges Forward with Strong Bullish Signals Source: tradingview Optimism (OP) is currently trading between fifty-six and seventy-eight cents. This shows stability with a slight bullish trend, as it edges closer to ninety-one cents, the nearest resistance. The rise of over five percent in a month indicates some positive momentum. However, with its significant drop of over seventy-six percent in six months, the path to recovery remains challenging. Optimism's price could rise by about twenty percent if it breaks past the current resistance level and reaches the next target at $1.13. Bulls show promise, but bears aren't out of the picture.

Learn More about Graphite Network Uniswap (UNI) Shows Strong Potential for 40% Rally Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) is currently trading between $5.57 and $7.37, showing a mixed picture for investors. While bulls might seem to lack strength at this moment, given the price is just under the 100-day moving average of $6.30, there's potential for growth. Confidence could boost the coin toward its next resistance at $8.44. This would mean an increase of around 40% from the lower end of its current range. A climb to the second resistance level of $10.25 could further indicate bullish momentum. Yet, the recent 28% monthly gain suggests there’s positive traction. If the momentum continues, it could mean more upward movement for Uniswap. Conclusion The crypto market's resilient comeback from the recent political feud highlights a diverse set of opportunities for investors. For those looking to trade the recovery, tokens like Optimism (OP) offer a slow-and-steady path, while Uniswap (UNI) shows stronger momentum for a potential breakout. However, the most powerful play may be investing in the ""why"" behind the comeback itself—in foundational projects like Graphite Network that build the trust and decentralization the market now craves. Whether betting on market momentum or its core principles, the path forward is paved with compelling options. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Investors are eagerly anticipating these funds, speculating that prices could skyrocket with official announcements. The coming pages will reveal the specific coins poised for significant growth, offering a unique opportunity to buy low before the market reacts. Excitement and careful timing could lead to lucrative gains. Solana's Recent Trends: Analyzing Volatility and Current Market Position Solana experienced moderate upward movement over the last month, achieving a 1.65% price increase. Over the past six months, the coin suffered a 36.85% decline, underscoring ongoing market struggles. A one-week drop of 4.19% further highlighted short-term weakness, even as pockets of recovery emerged during the recent month. Overall trends suggest that while short-term corrections may offer some optimism, the long-term trajectory remains challenging, indicating persistent bearish sentiment. Past performance reflects fluctuations between brief rallies and steep drops, shaping a cautious outlook for the near future. Solana currently trades within a range between $136 and $182.20, with key technical levels attracting market attention. Nearest resistance is at $207.90, which may hold strong if there is an upward push, while a second resistance at $253.93 represents an additional barrier for buyers. Support is observed around $115.84, with a deeper safety zone at $69.81 for potential downside protection. Technical indicators reveal a predominantly bearish tone, as the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator both indicate downward pressure. The Relative Strength Index reading of 39.58 shows market caution, as momentum appears lost despite a modest monthly gain. The price action lacks a clear trend and remains confined within established zones. Traders may consider entering long positions near support with tight stop-losses or initiating shorts when pressing against upper resistance, emphasizing the need for effective risk management in this uncertain environment. Sui Price Analysis: Key Levels and Market Behavior Overview SUI prices showed modest weekly recovery of just under 2% while suffering a 2.36% drop over the last month and a sharper 23.10% decline in the past six months. Price movement hints at a slow loss of momentum with recent fluctuations not fully reversing past declines. The coin has experienced a restrained recovery in the short term, even though its longer-term trend has been down. The figures underline a period of volatility with low gains on a weekly scale and notable weakness over extended periods. Current price levels span from roughly $2.77 to $4.01, with key support at $2.29 and second support near $1.05, while resistance appears closest at $4.77 and extends to $6.01 at a higher level. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 45.11 along with a negative Awesome Oscillator suggest subdued bullish activity and mounting bearish pressure. SUI finds itself trading in a confined range without a decisive trend. Short-term trades might benefit from a bounce off the $2.29 support, whereas a rally could face selling at the $4.77 resistance. Monitoring key levels remains essential for traders looking to exploit minor swings or potential breakouts within this range. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Levels Over the past month, Dogecoin showed a modest recovery with a 5.5% price rise despite a challenging performance over the last six months, where it experienced a steep decline of nearly 61%. The coin’s price movement has been volatile, reflecting a mix of short-term upward momentum against a longer-term downward trend. A slight rebound in the monthly performance hints at some underlying buyer interest, although the significant six-month loss highlights ongoing market struggles and overall bearish sentiment. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.1512 and $0.2470, with key support around $0.1097 and primary resistance near $0.3013. The second support at $0.0139 and a higher resistance at $0.3971 are important for trading decisions. Technical indicators, such as the RSI, suggest that sellers continue to dominate. The absence of a clear trend adds uncertainty, meaning traders might consider buying if the price holds above support levels, while a break above resistance could indicate renewed bullish action. Caution in this price range may provide opportunities for short-term trades or implementing tighter stop-loss orders. Conclusion Investing in upcoming crypto ETFs can be a smart move. Coins like SOL , SUI , and DOGE are likely to see price surges once the announcements are made. Buying them early could lead to significant gains. Keep an eye on these coins and act before the official news boosts their values. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The clash lit a fire under both of their empires. Trump’s presidency now hangs on a bill that could collapse if even three Republicans flip. Musk’s billions in government contracts are suddenly dangling over a cliff. Trump made the first move Thursday when he threatened to cancel every government contract tied to Elon’s businesses. That hit would destroy a good chunk of Elon’s portfolio. SpaceX, which works with the Pentagon, NASA, and intelligence agencies, would be gutted. It’s the main ride for astronauts to the International Space Station. It handles national security launches. NASA even gave it nearly $5 billion in crew contracts and another $4 billion to build a vehicle for moon missions. There’s also an $843 million deal for SpaceX to take down the station in 2030. Add in the $1.8 billion classified contract with the National Reconnaissance Office, and you’re looking at a network of deals worth tens of billions. And Elon wanted more. He was lining up for a shot at Trump’s missile-defense program, Golden Dome for America. That door’s closing. One official said Elon won’t be finding many allies left in Trump’s White House. After Elon trashed the president’s legislative bill this week, Republicans around Trump started floating the idea of cutting him out altogether. Trump made it official himself on Thursday. Tesla and xAI now tangled in political fire Tesla got smacked hard the same day—its market value dropped by $152.4 billion. That’s the largest one-day loss the company’s ever taken. Elon blamed the drop on the war over federal support and regulatory problems. He’s been pushing the government for changes to allow nationwide self-driving cars. Right now, individual states make those calls, and that’s been blocking his rollout plans. In April, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy visited Elon in Austin. They shot a video together from the Tesla factory. “We’re here in Austin, Texas, at the Tesla factory with Elon Musk, the great,” Sean said on X. Elon replied, “Obviously, it would be wonderful for the United States to have a national set of rules for autonomous driving.” Tesla plans to launch its first self-driving taxi service in Austin later this month. But the pressure isn’t just coming from self-driving rules. Tesla’s profits from emissions credit sales—worth hundreds of millions every quarter—are also in danger. Last month, Congress killed California’s power to set its own tailpipe emissions rules. That was one of the strongest drivers of EV investment in the U.S. If federal fuel and emissions rules also get watered down, that income dries up fast. Sales are already tanking. Tesla’s numbers in the U.S. and Europe have been falling for months. The timing lines up with Elon’s growing public closeness to Trump. Now that the alliance is dead, Tesla’s collapse may just be getting started. Trump’s entire bill now depends on a few shaky votes While Elon’s companies burn, Trump is running out of political breathing room. His mega-bill—a mix of tax cuts, border money, and slashes to Medicaid and food stamps—barely passed the House. The vote was 215–214. If just three Republicans flip, the bill goes down. And Elon’s trying to make that happen. He called the bill a “disgusting abomination” and claimed it would pile $2.5 trillion onto the national deficit. Then he went further. “Such ingratitude,” Elon posted on X, saying Trump would have lost the 2024 election without his money. Elon gave more than $250 million to Trump’s re-election effort and made it clear he’s not done spending—only this time, it could be against Trump. Rep. David Schweikert of Arizona, who missed the first vote, said Thursday that he wants “multiple changes” before he’ll support the bill. “Musk is absolutely right,” he told The Wall Street Journal, talking about the debt impact. Reps. Thomas Massie and Warren Davidson also sided with Elon and voted against it. White House aides said Elon’s attacks are backfiring. They believe his criticisms are actually pushing Republicans closer to Trump, not pulling them away. Still, Trump’s allies admit it’s getting harder to hold the line with Elon raging online to 220.5 million followers. Elon’s not stopping there. On Thursday, he polled users on X asking if they’d support a new political party. More than 3.5 million people voted. Over 81% said yes. That’s not just talk—it’s a warning. Trump’s grip on the House is already razor-thin. If Elon splits the base or funds candidates to knock out Trump loyalists, Republicans risk losing the chamber in 2026. One Republican on the House Financial Services Committee said Elon’s outbursts are “not helpful.” He also warned that the standoff could damage Elon’s long-term relationships with GOP lawmakers, especially those who used to see him as an ally.

The agency reportedly said on record that Javier didn’t break any laws when he posted about Libra on X in February, adding that the post was made in a personal capacity, didn’t involve federal resources, and didn’t violate any public ethics codes. That ruling officially ends the government’s internal investigation, though a federal court case is still ongoing and hasn’t been closed yet. The scandal started when Javier shared a message about Libra just hours after meeting the token’s founders. His post boosted the token’s visibility instantly. That same day, Libra’s price spiked, and wallets holding large amounts of the coin were dumped. The sudden crash led to massive losses for retail investors. Many accused the government of backing a pump-and-dump scam, pointing directly to Javier and his inner circle. But Javier defended himself at the time, saying, “I wasn’t trying to sell anything. I just wanted to promote a project that helps Argentine businesses.” Government shuts down Libra investigation unit after only 3 months The Libra fallout forced the Argentine government to quickly form a special task force, called the Investigative Task Force (UTI), to review the crypto drama. The unit was created by presidential decree, with signatures from both Javier and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona. Its job was to investigate whether there were any irregularities in how Libra was promoted, who profited from it, and whether any laws were broken. The UTI also had the power to request documents from public and international bodies, respond to court demands, and report any attempts to cover up evidence. But three months after its creation, the UTI was dismantled. A formal decree, signed again by Javier and Mariano, stated that the unit “has fulfilled the functions assigned to it,” with no further explanation given. That move closed the executive branch’s internal inquiry. The UTI never publicly released any findings before it was shut down. The decision came after public anger exploded, especially from crypto investors who believed the token had government backing. Some had assumed Libra was Argentina’s new official crypto project. Instead, they were left holding bags of a worthless token. Reports later revealed that only a few wallets controlled most of the Libra supply. Those wallets were emptied shortly after Javier’s post, triggering the crash and locking everyday Argentines into losses. Retail investors flooded local regulators with complaints. They demanded answers about whether someone in the government had advance knowledge and made money while the public got wrecked. The Libra controversy reached Argentina’s Congress too. In April, lawmakers formed a 28-member special investigative committee to look into the case further, but no formal proceedings have begun. Despite being summoned to appear on May 14, neither Mariano Cúneo Libarona nor Economy Minister Luis Caputo showed up. Their absence has drawn criticism from opposition politicians and some investors who say the government is dodging responsibility. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

They also want excitement, clarity, and steady movement. This trend is reshaping which projects lead the charts, some come with long-standing credibility, while others bring new presale styles that turn purchasing into an active experience. Among the top cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG leads with its gamified presale strategy, followed by well-known coins like HBAR, Litecoin, and Filecoin. Here’s why each of these coins is gaining attention, starting with the one making the biggest impact. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Gamified Presale Pushes Strong Buyer Action BlockDAG is reshaping what a presale looks like by turning the buying process into a competitive game. Through its “Buyer Battles,” people appear on a real-time leaderboard, gaining recognition for their rank. This simple tool encourages ongoing buying pressure, something many presales fail to create. Studies in human behavior show that competition and visibility can strongly motivate people. When rewards are tied to public ranking, people are more likely to act. Rather than wait for hype cycles or market rallies, BlockDAG sees daily momentum. Seeing other buyers climb the leaderboard creates pressure to act before prices change. While many presales rely on emails or influencers, BlockDAG turns its participants into promoters by giving them public visibility. So far, over $289 million has been raised, and 22.1 billion coins have been sold. The presale price remains $0.0020, promising a 2,520% return from the first-stage price. With 1.5 million X1 mining app users and fast-growing interest, BlockDAG isn’t only among the top cryptos to buy now, it’s proving how interactive models can drive serious traction. 2. Hedera (HBAR): Energy-Saving and Enterprise-Focused Hedera stands out as a low-energy alternative in blockchain tech. Using a Hashgraph model, it handles large volumes of transactions without delays or high costs. It avoids the issues that proof-of-work networks face, finalizing thousands of operations per second with very little energy. For those who want tech embraced by big names, HBAR is worth noting. With connections to Google, IBM, and LG, the backing behind Hedera is solid. Its public ledger is being used for tools in digital ID, payments, and supply chains. The reason it’s listed among top cryptos to buy now is due to this dependable support and future-proof roadmap. Even when markets dip, Hedera remains steady due to its strong partnerships and real-world value. 3. Litecoin (LTC): Dependable, Fast, and Easy to Access Litecoin is often called the digital silver of crypto, staying strong for years. While it doesn’t always make headlines, it shines with its reliable transactions and lower fees. It’s a long-standing option that serves well for direct digital transfers. LTC also benefits from being easy to find. It’s listed across most exchanges and works with nearly every wallet. This wide access makes it a good pick for those who want something established and trusted in the market. Another point in its favor is that Litecoin often moves in sync with Bitcoin during upward trends. Though it lacks flashy stories, it quietly delivers decent returns. For those considering top cryptos to buy now without needing big hype, Litecoin is a solid and stable option. 4. Filecoin (FIL): Leading the Way in Decentralized Storage Filecoin brings real purpose to the space by focusing on digital storage through a distributed network. It rewards users for lending out spare storage space, making room for a web where no central player has control over pricing or access. What gives Filecoin an edge is its focus on a problem that affects everyone: central data control. Unlike others that treat storage as a side benefit, Filecoin builds its entire system around it. FIL’s price has shifted with the broader crypto market, but its usefulness and active development keep it in play. Those who want to back real utility beyond finance will find Filecoin among the top cryptos to buy now for tech-led growth. Final Say! Looking at the top cryptos to buy now , the strongest ones don’t just ride hype. They offer clear use, ongoing activity, or new models of buyer interaction. BlockDAG leads the way with its gamified presale that turns every purchase into a contest.

On Friday, June 6, the premier cryptocurrency fell towards the $101,000 level, reflecting an uptick in the market volatility over the past few days. While the Bitcoin price has quickly recovered from this sudden downturn, there is still real concern about the market leader’s performance since reaching its record-high value. However, a new indicator suggests that the price of BTC might still have some time to run up to a new high. Analyst Predicts Four Months Of Opportunity For BTC In a recent post on the X platform, crypto expert Joao Wedson revealed that there might still be some degree of opportunity in the Bitcoin market. This observation is based on a model, which was accurate in predicting past all-time high prices for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Traders Turn Bearish on Bitcoin Following High-Profile Political Tensions, Data Shows This revelation is based on the Max Intersect SMA Model (the blue line), which has accurately identified the tops of past Bitcoin cycles. According to Wedson’s post, this cycle top prediction model suggests that the price of BTC could still have around four months of upward growth potential — regardless of the volatility and market shakeout. As seen in the chart above, the price of Bitcoin reaches its current cycle peak whenever the Max Intersect SMA (simple moving average) hits the previous cycle top. In the 2021 cycle, the top prediction model hit the 2018 high of around $19,000 in November 2021, culminating in a then-all-time high of $69,000. Hence, when this Max Intersect SMA hits exactly $69,000 — the price top in the last cycle, that will represent the peak of this current cycle. Wedson also asserted that this model is pretty reliable, as it is backed by 200 tested algorithms. With this top prediction model still a bit off $69,000, the Bitcoin price might still be some months away from its peak. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As mentioned earlier, the price of BTC seems to be struggling after recently hitting its current all-time high above the $110,000 mark. This week’s performance must have tested investors’ patience as the flagship cryptocurrency mostly traded within a consolidation range.

As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $104,400, reflecting an over 2% price increase in the past 24 hours.

In this competitive environment, identifying the best cryptos to join for long term becomes a critical strategy. From streamlined payment systems to blockchain integrations across industries, only a few projects offer real innovation backed by scalable technology. Qubetics , with its Web3 aggregator model and cross-border settlement utility, is leading this charge by combining real-world application with scalable infrastructure. Among them, Qubetics emerges with disruptive potential as the world’s first Web3 aggregator—designed to streamline multi-chain payments and transform cross-border transactions. In parallel, two other major players—Solana and Stellar—have taken impressive strides, with new developments fortifying their presence. These blockchain giants are building ecosystems around speed, scalability, and interoperability that continue to draw global participation. Qubetics: The Blockchain Backbone for Global Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics doesn’t just ride the wave of blockchain hype—it builds the bridge that connects fragmented ecosystems. By integrating the $TICS token with real-time settlement capabilities, Qubetics has carved out a crucial use case in international finance: frictionless, near-instant cross-border payments. This application alone positions Qubetics among the best cryptos to join for long term, especially as it targets inefficiencies traditional payment rails have long ignored. Qubetics enables financial institutions, enterprises, and individuals to transfer funds securely without the latency and hidden costs that plague SWIFT and legacy systems. The platform supports banks aiming to eliminate settlement delays, multinational businesses seeking smoother cash flow operations, and even families in need of quicker remittances. The result is a cost-effective and transparent blockchain layer that addresses real financial pain points. For example, consider a logistics firm in Texas needing to settle supplier invoices in Southeast Asia. Instead of waiting 3-5 business days for bank processing, the transaction finalizes in seconds via $TICS. A remote freelancer receiving USD payments in Argentina can similarly access funds instantly without routing through multiple intermediaries. This utility—combined with the promise of scalability through the Qubetics Web3 Aggregator—makes it a standout in utility-driven crypto solutions. With adoption expanding through strategic partnerships and the upcoming Qubetics mainnet launch in Q2 2025, it’s no surprise that this project ranks high among the best cryptos to join for long term. Qubetics Final Stage Gains Attention as One of the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term With a Fixed Price Increase Ahead Now in Stage 37, the final round of its public presale, Qubetics is offering $TICS at a fixed rate of $0.3370. Having raised more than $17.7 million and distributed over 515 million tokens to 27,500+ holders, the project is gaining momentum. With only 10 million tokens left and a confirmed listing price of $0.40—offering early buyers a 20% edge—Qubetics is widely considered one of the most promising crypto presales to join in June 2025, especially for investors focused on clarity and structured tokenomics. The team has recently revised its tokenomics to improve long-term value. Total supply has been reduced from over 4 billion tokens to 1.36 billion, helping control future circulation and support value stability. In addition, the public allocation was increased to 38.55%, giving a greater share of tokens to the broader community. This model is designed to support decentralization, promote user-led participation, and maintain fairness in distribution. From an investment standpoint, a $2,000 commitment at the current price secures approximately 5,937 $TICS tokens. Once the token lists at $0.40, that holding would be valued at $2,400. If $TICS reaches $5 in a later growth cycle, the value could rise to $29,685. At a $10 price point, it would be worth $59,370. These calculations are based on current supply figures and confirmed price levels. With a capped presale phase, adjusted tokenomics, and active community support, Qubetics continues to gain recognition as one of the best cryptos to join for long term , especially for those focused on early-stage blockchain projects with clearly defined fundamentals. Solana: Reinforcing Scalability Through Institutional Expansion Solana has long been recognized for its unmatched transaction speed and ultra-low fees, and the project is advancing in meaningful ways. Through its robust architecture, Solana is integrating with enterprise-grade projects, bolstering its claim as a go-to blockchain for applications requiring high throughput. Recent integrations in gaming, DeFi, and enterprise services reflect Solana’s ongoing transition from just a fast chain to a functional ecosystem. One standout is its focus on Layer-1 efficiency to support large-scale applications like NFT platforms and decentralized social media, where speed is not a luxury but a necessity. Projects building on Solana benefit from seamless scaling and a developer-friendly environment supported by a rapidly growing community. Major tech players are exploring ways to leverage Solana’s parallel processing (via Sealevel) for real-time apps and financial platforms. Its development team remains laser-focused on reducing downtime issues that once plagued the chain—an important pivot that gives institutions and developers confidence. Solana’s broader ecosystem is also being designed to support mobile-friendly solutions and cross-platform DApps. These continuous improvements place Solana on the radar of those seeking not just hype but a deeply integrated blockchain that delivers value across verticals. Stellar: Empowering Financial Inclusion Through Decentralized Transfers Stellar was born to connect global banking systems with the unbanked. With a laser focus on remittances and micro-payments, Stellar’s network facilitates cross-border payments at a fraction of traditional costs. Unlike many chains focused on NFTs or gaming, Stellar retains its core vision: universal access to global finance. Recently, Stellar has been doubling down on partnerships with financial institutions in underserved regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These collaborations focus on increasing accessibility, reducing transfer times, and eliminating hidden fees. Stellar’s partnership model works hand-in-hand with its consensus protocol—one designed to be lightweight, fast, and reliable for financial messaging and settlement. Developers are taking advantage of Stellar’s SDKs and fiat anchors to bridge local economies with global currencies. For instance, platforms that allow users in Kenya to receive USD or EUR via mobile wallets rely on Stellar’s low-fee architecture. Stellar’s expansion into decentralized asset issuance and cross-currency swaps further enhances its value proposition. With global regulators warming up to compliant DeFi solutions, Stellar remains in the conversation for projects building the rails of next-generation finance. It continues to appeal to communities and networks that require efficient, scalable, and compliant payment rails. Conclusion: Which Blockchain Will Shape the Next Decade? Each of these platforms—Qubetics, Solana, and Stellar—brings something uniquely powerful to the table. Solana shines with its raw processing power and Layer-1 utility, appealing to developers building high-demand applications. Stellar remains a champion of financial inclusion, ensuring millions gain access to fast and low-cost cross-border payments. However, Qubetics sets itself apart with its hybrid value proposition: serving institutions, individuals, and ecosystems alike by enabling fast and secure cross-border settlements through its $TICS token. With unmatched ROI projections and a fast-moving Qubetics presale, this project is drawing serious interest from long-term community members seeking more than hype. Those seeking the best cryptos to join for long term would be wise to consider these ecosystems—especially those looking to join this best crypto presale before the next price surge.

According to the settlement administrator, the distribution of settlement payments has now begun and will continue over the next several weeks. The 2021 cyberattack compromised the personal data of a staggering 76 million US customers, exposing names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and other sensitive information. T-Mobile agreed to the settlement in July of 2022 to resolve claims from the August 2021 breach. Customers eligible for payments will receive a digital deposit or paper check based on their selection during the claim process, with amounts ranging from $25 to $100, with some eligible for up to $25,000 for substantial documented losses. The settlement also includes two years of free identity protection services for affected customers. The breach, one of the largest in U.S. history, prompted lawsuits accusing T-Mobile of failing to secure customer data. T-Mobile says it has since enhanced its cybersecurity protocols to prevent future incidents, and the company did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.

Both platforms promise unique advantages for enterprises. This article delves into the distinctive features and potential of each, exploring which project might be primed to attract the next wave of significant investments. VeChain: Steady Resistance Amidst Historic Declines Over the past month, VeChain experienced a modest dip of less than 1%, contrasting sharply with a significant decline of nearly 65% over the last six months. Price movements remained within a narrow range, with minimal week-to-week changes averaging around 0.61%. This indicates a period of limited recovery amidst ongoing weakness. Volatility was low recently, suggesting a phase of temporary consolidation. The overall trend over the six months reflects persistent bearish pressure, as past trading sessions showcased slow recovery attempts overshadowed by continued downward momentum. Currently, the price hovers between approximately $0.02 and $0.03, constrained by support around $0.015 and resistance near $0.039. A secondary resistance point resides at $0.051, with further support levels below $0.003. Indicators reflect a slight negative bias, showing a modest negative oscillator and momentum reading, while the relative strength index stands around 43, indicating neutrality. With no clear trend established, traders may explore range-bound strategies, targeting purchases near support and watching for potential breakouts past resistance. Caution is advised as technical signals suggest a prevailing bearish environment, though small gains could provide short-term recovery opportunities. Algorand Faces Decline: Short-Term Struggles Amid Long-Term Weakness Algorand experienced a moderate decline over the last month, falling by approximately 4.74%. Over six months, this decline intensified to nearly 61.86%, showcasing persistent selling pressure. Despite brief periods of relative calm, sustained weakness dominates. Attempts at rallies have faced strong resistance, indicating an ongoing struggle to reclaim previous highs. The market has shown difficulty in building upward momentum, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Algorand is currently trading within a range of $0.17 to $0.24, with resistance at $0.29 and a secondary level at $0.36. Key support sits at $0.14, while a further level is around $0.07. The Awesome Oscillator and momentum indicators highlight ongoing selling pressure. Currently, bears are in control, and price movements lack a clear upward trend. Traders should watch the $0.14 support for potential buying opportunities, while failing to overcome the $0.29 resistance might prompt short positions or a wait-and-see approach. Conclusion VET and ALGO both offer strong enterprise solutions with unique strengths. VET focuses on supply chain logistics and has partnerships with major corporations. ALGO emphasizes efficient transactions and is backed by solid academic research. Both have the potential to attract significant institutional interest. The choice between them may depend on specific business needs and existing partnerships. As the blockchain sector grows, VET and ALGO are positioned to play crucial roles in enterprise adoption.

Ruvi AI isn’t just another presale token; it’s a platform that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to tackle real-world challenges, making it a standout option for savvy investors. Here’s why Ruvi AI could be the better bet right now. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success While Solana continues to climb, Ruvi AI is blazing its own trail during its presale. With a current Phase 2 token price of $0.015 , the project has raised over $1.5 million and sold nearly 135 million tokens . Early investors who joined in Phase 1 have already enjoyed a 50% increase in value , demonstrating the strength of Ruvi AI’s growth plan. Even more enticing is the $0.07 valuation set for after the presale , a preset feature of the presale itself rather than mere speculation. Analysts also foresee a potential post-listing valuation of $1 per token , providing substantial upside. At its core, Ruvi AI is a project designed for massive scalability and long-term significance. Solana vs. Ruvi AI Solana, known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, gained traction in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, as an established player, its exponential growth may taper compared to emerging projects like Ruvi AI, which offer higher growth potential due to their early-stage positioning. Where Solana has carved out a strong niche, Ruvi AI breaks new ground by providing real-world solutions : Healthcare : Ruvi AI enhances diagnosis processes, improving accuracy and patient outcomes. Logistics : Through smarter supply chain tools, the platform mitigates inefficiencies, saving time and money for businesses. Finance : Secure transaction systems and advanced fraud detection make Ruvi AI a vital tool in modern financial operations. By focusing on practical applications, Ruvi AI is creating value that ensures continuous demand for its token far beyond speculative trading. Maximizing Gains With Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI sweetens the deal for investors with VIP investment tiers , offering attractive bonuses for those who get in early. Here’s how each tier works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers highlight how early investors can benefit from Ruvi AI’s structured growth strategy, amplifying gains as the project continues to mature. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Ruvi AI’s innovation in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance sets it apart from Solana and other established players. These are sectors with tremendous growth potential, ensuring Ruvi AI remains relevant and in demand as the global economy evolves. Equally important is the project’s presale timing. With tokens priced at just $0.015 , Ruvi AI presents a rare opportunity to secure significant returns before broader market awareness drives up its value. This early-stage access makes Ruvi AI a compelling offering for investors looking to maximize gains in a relatively short timeframe. Final Thoughts Solana’s anticipated climb to $250 signals strong market interest, but it’s projects like Ruvi AI that offer the real potential for life-changing returns . With tokens already up 50% for Phase 1 investors and a structured growth plan in place, Ruvi AI is a forward-thinking project combining innovation and practicality.

With SUI showing recent positive gains, the question arises: can Toncoin break through its key resistance levels next? This article delves into the potential of these coins and examines whether Toncoin can mirror SUI's upward trend, promising intriguing insights for crypto enthusiasts. Sui Price Analysis: Key Levels and Market Behavior Overview SUI prices showed modest weekly recovery of just under 2% while suffering a 2.36% drop over the last month and a sharper 23.10% decline in the past six months. Price movement hints at a slow loss of momentum with recent fluctuations not fully reversing past declines. The coin has experienced a restrained recovery in the short term, even though its longer-term trend has been down. The figures underline a period of volatility with low gains on a weekly scale and notable weakness over extended periods. Current price levels span from roughly $2.77 to $4.01, with key support at $2.29 and second support near $1.05, while resistance appears closest at $4.77 and extends to $6.01 at a higher level. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 45.11 along with a negative Awesome Oscillator suggest subdued bullish activity and mounting bearish pressure. SUI finds itself trading in a confined range without a decisive trend. Short-term trades might benefit from a bounce off the $2.29 support, whereas a rally could face selling at the $4.77 resistance. Monitoring key levels remains essential for traders looking to exploit minor swings or potential breakouts within this range. Toncoin Market Overview: Recent Gains Amid Long-Term Decline Past month TON shifts show a modest gain of 5.04% while the half-year change reflects a steep drop of 53.33%. Price action moved upward slowly over the last few weeks, with a one-week increase of 2.46% offering hints of short-term recovery. Indicators remain close to neutral, suggesting that the recent move has not yet overturned the broader negative trend seen over the past six months. The mixed performance over these periods marks a phase of volatility, where gains were limited and losses significant in the larger timeframe. Current prices trade between $2.79 and $3.61. Key levels to watch include immediate support at $2.43 and resistance near $4.06, while second levels fall at $1.61 support and $4.88 resistance. With technical indicators showing a 50.81 RSI and slightly negative momentum, the market lacks a strong clear trend. Bulls are testing limits near the $4.06 mark, but bears still influence price movements due to the recent deep drawdown. Traders might consider entering positions that respect these boundaries, watching for a break above resistance or a drop below support to better time entries and exits. Conclusion TON can potentially follow SUI 's lead, but market conditions and investor sentiment will play crucial roles. SUI's recent positive gains offer hope for similar performance from other coins. If Toncoin can break key resistance levels, it might see significant upward movement. The development and adoption of both SUI and TON will be pivotal in determining their future success. The market's reaction in the coming weeks will be essential for these coins.

During this period, the premier cryptocurrency crashed by an estimated 5% from $106,000 to trade below $101,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term volatility, several key technical indicators now point to a potentially bullish setup. In fact, this latest pullback appears to complete a series of signals that historically precede major price rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Bitcoin Set For Price Surge, First Target At $130,000 In an X post on June 6, a market expert with X username CrypFlow shares a bullish Bitcoin prediction amidst an ongoing price correction. Aside from sharp price decline in the past week, the BTC market has witnessed a steady price correction since the premier cryptocurrency achieved a new-all time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, CrypFlow states that this price retracement alongside a host of other technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is setting to repeat its price rally from Q4 2024. The first indicator observed by the analyst in the chart above is the golden cross which occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (50SMA) crosses above the 200-day simple moving average (200SMA) in early June 2025. The golden cross is a common bullish indicator that signals a shift in market momentum and was last seen in November 2024. Furthermore, there is a Bitcoin price breakout above a long-standing purple downward trendline that originated in December 2024. This breakout also mirrors another move seen in early November 2024, when BTC breached the descending resistance that began in March 2024. The ongoing price correction represents the final indicator as Bitcoin also suffered an estimated 10% price fall in November falling from $74,500 to $68,500 before initially an explosive price rally. CrypFlow’s analysis suggests that if Bitcoin is repeating its price rally from Q4 2024, the premier cryptocurrency could produce a 62% price gain translating into potential targets around $170,000. However, the analyst has set a more conservative initial price target of $130,000, representing a 25% gain from current market levels.

According to data from prediction site Coincodex, the general BTC market sentiment remains bullish despite a Fear & Greed Index of 45 which indicates Fear. The Coincodex analyst team are backing this market’s positivity with a price projection of $134,074 in five days and $155,864 in three months.

In a tweet, Ardoino shared images of shops in the country showing prices in USDT, suggesting that these could open the gates for stablecoins in the retail market. In Bolivia, real prices in shops are displayed in USD₮. A quietly revolutionary shift: digital dollars are powering daily life, commerce, and economic stability. pic.twitter.com/dGP7I2ipxv — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 7, 2025 Photos from these stores show items such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and Oreo products printed with the USDT price, not the more traditional Bolivian Boliviano. Ardoino emphasized that the stablecoin is now a part of people’s daily lives in the state. He noted that w hen digital currency is used for commerce, the relevance to the digital age is modernizing transactions, and the contextual relevance is mastering economic instability. Ardoino’s images also include popular products, including sunglasses and Milka chocolate, tagged with prices in USDT. Bolivia embraces USDT as shoppers ditch cash According to the Central Bank of Bolivia, some goods are now exclusively sold with prices set in USDT. That illustrates Bolivians’ increasing trust in digital money and the greater cryptocurrency market, including the Ethereum price. Price tags are now confusingly appearing in USDT, as the Boliviano increasingly becomes a thing of the past in regular point-of-sale transactions. This is happening as the country is also facing a myriad of economic struggles, and digital currencies have become a more stable source of value than the Nation’s fiat currency. Using Tether’s stablecoin allows customers to pay via digital wallets instead of cash, marking a new era where technology increasingly shapes payment methods. For experts, this is a major milestone. Hence, they think that the country could inspire other states to do the same. Digital payments might attract more organizations to start using them. This is especially true as platforms like Coinbase slash account freezes by 82% , signaling broader accessibility. However, this shift also highlights the requirement for coherent government policies to manage the digital currency industry. Meanwhile, many Bolivians are already accustomed to buying everyday goods in USDT. The Central Bank’s proposal to allow residents to exchange Bolivianos for Tether’s stablecoin could further simplify transactions and reduce exchange rate uncertainties. Bolivia reverses crypto ban as stablecoin adoption surges Mid last year, Bolivia’s central bank , Banco Central de Bolivia, lifted its ban on Bitcoin and crypto payments, allowing financial institutions to transact with digital assets. The ban has been in place since 2014 . In September 2024, the country reported a 100% rise in virtual asset trading , with roughly $15.6 million worth of assets traded every month between July and September. The $48.6 million traded was largely made up of stablecoins. Stablecoins are often used in developing countries whose local currency has experienced a high degree of devaluation or where there’s a shortage of foreign currency. Stablecoin use gained further momentum in Bolivia in October 2024 when local bank Banco Bisa introduced a stablecoin custody service . That service, which the country’s financial regulator supported, allows the nation’s residents to buy, sell, and trade Tether’s USDT, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Reports from September 2016 show that the state had much to gain from adopting cryptocurrencies . At that time, much of that country’s citizens were unbanked, with just 11% of residents using a debit card to make payments and only 5% using credit cards. However, the country continued upholding its ban until 2024, calling crypto a pyramid scheme in May 2017 and arresting crypto advocates.

As one of the best cryptos to buy now, ETH’s renewed strength is backed by network upgrades and growing DeFi activity, fueling bullish sentiment across the market. Meanwhile, savvy investors aren’t just focusing on blue-chip tokens, they’re also doubling down on promising a new crypto coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) under $1, seeking the next big cryptocurrency primed for explosive growth, with some projections pointing to an impressive 34x rally. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,700 members before a token price boost to $0.035 at the start of the next stage. More than $10.1 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Whether you’re tracking crypto news today or exploring what crypto to invest in, Ethereum and these emerging altcoins are dominating conversations this week. Ethereum Eyes $3,000 Amid Renewed Bullish Momentum The current price of Ethereum (ETH) is roughly $2,628.47 which is a small 0.49% rise compared to yesterday’s price. It seems ETH has escaped its early 2025 downtrend based on recent price movements, pointing to an increasing bull market. Analysts are predicting that Ethereum may rise to $2,900 by mid-June, so long as it keeps getting support and the market stays in good shape. Ethereum is favored by most investors looking for reliable cryptocurrencies, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts people interested in highly profitable crypto assets. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $10.1 million and accumulated 11,700 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 during the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. Certik-Audited With Upcoming Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a $100,000 giveaway distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. Ethereum is pushing toward $3,000, driven by bullish momentum and ETF inflows. But while ETH leads the headlines, investors are quietly jumping into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new DeFi token priced at just $0.03. With over $10.1 million raised and 11,700+ holders, early buyers could see 100% ROI at launch. Backed by a dual lending model, a stablecoin, and a Certik audit, MUTM is gaining fast. For those seeking the next big crypto, ETH and MUTM are strong picks right now.

Solana (SOL) is gaining fresh momentum with analysts speculating on a $300 billion market cap. In contrast, Pi Network (PI) continues to face headwinds, struggling with technical weaknesses and unclear progress. Yet, in a space where attention moves fast, one rising project is pulling focus. That project is Unstaked, a decentralized AI platform combining utility with zero-code tools. It has already sold over 1 billion $UNSD tokens, raised more than $9 million, and kicked off a $1 million Gleam giveaway that has both speculators and builders taking notice. With no private sales and a smart launch structure, Unstaked is being positioned as one of the most bullish crypto coins of 2025. Solana (SOL) Maintains Strength as Analysts Eye a $300B Milestone Solana is showing renewed signs of long-term potential. Price action is consolidating just above a major demand zone following what analysts call a “clean liquidity sweep” on the weekly chart. This pattern, which typically signals the end of a correction and the beginning of a new upward phase, has become a key bullish indicator. The case for Solana is not just about technical setups. On-chain activity continues to climb, with growing developer adoption and a steady expansion of its dApp ecosystem. Institutional interest is rising too, thanks to Solana’s performance efficiency and high transaction throughput. Market watchers are now looking for a retest of previous cycle highs, with targets suggesting a move toward $300 per coin. If realized, that would push Solana toward a $300 billion market cap, potentially making it one of the strongest bullish crypto coins to monitor in the year ahead. Pi Network (PI) Dips Deeper as Bearish Sentiment Spreads While Solana builds upward momentum, Pi Network is showing signs of sustained market weakness. At $0.61, PI has declined steadily from its recent high of $0.66, and technical indicators continue to reflect selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 19.59, marking deep oversold territory. Meanwhile, the Williams %R sits at -94.213, and the MACD has confirmed a bearish crossover. The negative trend is not limited to the charts. Pi Network’s roadmap remains vague, and mainnet progress has been slow to materialize. Without a significant technical or market catalyst, the project appears to be losing favor among early adopters. Unless Bitcoin sees a resurgence or Pi delivers meaningful development updates, continued downside remains the base case scenario. In contrast to bullish crypto coins like Solana, Pi is lagging behind both in momentum and narrative strength. Unstaked Raises $9M and Launches $1M Giveaway as Momentum Builds While the broader market shifts between bullish and bearish sentiment, Unstaked is carving out a path of its own. Currently in Stage 19 of its crypto presale , the project has already sold more than 1 billion $UNSD tokens and raised nearly $9.1 million. At a current price of $0.011065 and a projected listing price of $0.1819, early adopters are eyeing a potential 28x return. But it’s not just about numbers. Unstaked’s protocol runs on a system called Proof of Intelligence, which allows AI agents to operate transparently and adapt through on-chain activity. The platform offers users the ability to create, deploy, and monetize these agents without writing a single line of code. With zero private allocations and fully public token access, Unstaked also presents a fair launch environment that appeals to both retail participants and community-first developers. It’s this combination of accessibility and innovation that positions it as one of the most bullish crypto coins to watch going forward. To amplify awareness and user engagement, Unstaked has rolled out a $1 million Gleam giveaway. Twenty participants will each win $50,000 worth of $UNSD tokens by completing simple tasks and purchasing at least $100 worth of tokens. This promotional campaign runs in tandem with the presale and is already drawing interest across Telegram, X, and crypto forums. The giveaway aligns closely with Unstaked’s roadmap and is being used to bring more wallets on-chain, spread awareness, and create buzz before the official launch. It’s also helping the project reach a wider audience of creators, DAOs, and builders who are looking for practical AI tools with direct application. With over 30% of the presale completed and tools scheduled for rollout shortly after launch, Unstaked is moving quickly and strategically. The project is emerging as more than a headline grabber, it’s becoming a serious contender for long-term growth. Final Thoughts: Utility, Access, and a Clear Road Ahead As we assess the crypto market landscape heading into the second half of 2025, a few key trends stand out. Solana is building strong structural support and targeting a $300 billion market cap, driven by clear fundamentals and market structure. Pi Network is facing steep challenges with weak momentum, limited development visibility, and declining investor confidence. Meanwhile, Unstaked is breaking through the noise. Its combination of AI-native tools, a decentralized and transparent distribution model, and a large-scale public giveaway is generating the kind of momentum rarely seen in presale projects. With over $9 million raised, strong product foundations, and a 28x upside baked into its pricing model, Unstaked could be the sleeper pick that defines the next market cycle.

That’s exactly what’s playing out with BlockDAG right now, just as attention starts shifting from familiar names like Cardano and SUI. Cardano is holding firm around $0.69, buoyed by institutional buzz, while SUI is showing resilience near $3.25, even after recent security concerns. But the spotlight is quickly turning to BlockDAG , especially with its $289 million raise and a major exchange rollout coming on June 13. Here’s the kicker: if you’ve already put in $200 or more, topping up by just 50% lets you double your BDAG. It’s not just a bonus, it’s a tactical play. Four uses per wallet, and once the deadline hits, the door closes. With listings across 20 exchanges just days away, this is one of the last chances to secure an outsized position before prices go public. Double BDAG, Half the Cost: Get In Before June 13! While many are buying BDAG at full price, a quieter group is locking in a far better deal. Right now, BlockDAG is running a limited-time promo that’s giving participants double the coins for just 50% more capital. Here’s how it works: if someone already bought $1,000 worth of BDAG, adding another $500 gets them $2,000 worth of coins. That’s not a typo, it’s a chance to seriously boost holdings without paying the inflated batch prices others are stuck with. This “Double Your BDAG” deal can be used up to four times per wallet, and the clock’s ticking. The offer disappears on June 13, just as BlockDAG prepares for its highly anticipated GO LIVE reveal. After that? Buyers could end up shelling out twice as much to catch up. Momentum is already building. BlockDAG has raised over $289 million, sold more than 22 billion coins, and continues gaining steam with over 1 million users mining through X-series devices. From the pocket-sized X1 app miner (earning 20 BDAG/day) to the industrial-grade X100 (pulling in 2,000 BDAG/day), the network is growing fast. More than 17,700 ASIC miners are already out there. What’s driving the surge? A mix of accessible mining tools, Ethereum compatibility, low-code smart contracts, and sustainable infrastructure. The current base price is still just $0.0018, while the current batch trades at $0.0262, already a 2,520% return. And with a listing set at $0.05, it’s clear the upside hasn’t even peaked. For those watching from the sidelines, this may be the last real chance to get in early, before everyone else catches on. Cardano Holds Firm with ETF Momentum Cardano (ADA) is holding its ground around $0.69, and there’s a lot working in its favor. Retail and institutional interest are both in play, especially with the SEC now reviewing Grayscale’s ETF proposal for ADA. Over in Japan, new exchange listings and zero-fee trading have helped turn it into a growing hub for Cardano activity. On-chain stats are strong, Cardano has crossed 110 million total transactions, and 22 billion ADA are staked, showing solid community involvement. Technically, things are picking up, too. The recent Node v10.4.1 release introduced UTXO-HD, which improves how transactions are processed. Smart contract testing is getting sharper, and early results from the upcoming Leios upgrade suggest speeds could reach 1,000 TPS. Looking ahead, ADA’s price targets sit between $0.70 and $0.90 for June, with the potential to hit $1.13 later this summer. With steady development and growing DeFi traction, Cardano could have more room to climb if it breaks through resistance. SUI Bounces Back After Cetus Exploit SUI is currently hovering around $3.25, and considering what it just went through, that’s saying a lot. After a $223 million exploit hit the Cetus DEX, the network moved fast, recovering $162 million in record time. That quick response highlighted how well validators can coordinate in a crisis, though it did spark some debate about decentralization. Even so, the price action has been surprisingly resilient. SUI bounced from $3.10 up to $3.32 after the hack and is now nudging against resistance levels at $3.41 and $3.52. If those flip, momentum could pick up again. But there’s more to the story than price. Sui’s been busy on the tech front. It launched Mysticeti to speed up consensus, added zero-knowledge logins, and introduced sponsored transactions to simplify onboarding. Developers using Move now have access to upgraded tools, including OAuth-linked wallets and delegated fee payments for added security. Looking ahead, June price forecasts range from $2.27 to $4.35. If Sui clears its resistance zones and continues improving its ecosystem, another rally might not be far off. Final Thoughts Cardano is holding steady near $0.69, backed by strong staking momentum and growing ETF chatter. SUI is bouncing back after the Cetus exploit, rolling out fresh tools and upgrades that have developers paying attention. But while both are making moves, BlockDAG is playing a different game, and it’s all about timing. Ahead of its June 13 exchange debut, BlockDAG’s “Double Your BDAG” promo is creating real buzz. Buyers who’ve already invested can add just 50% more and instantly double their total coins. It’s a strategic advantage, especially since most are still paying the current batch price. With only four chances per wallet and a hard stop before listings go live, this window won’t stay open long. Those who act now won’t just be early, they’ll be ahead. Because once BlockDAG goes public, the cost of catching up will be much higher.

33767162,[object Object],1749344429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Asset Managers Push SEC To Revive ‘First-To-File’ Principle – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/asset-managers-sec-revive-first-to-file-principle/,"Asset managers VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital have jointly approached the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking for a reinstatement of the first-to-file principle i.e. a regulatory approach that ensures exchange-traded products (ETP) applications are reviewed and approved in the order they are submitted. The trio of prominent investment firms claims that the Commission’s recent departure from this standard has stifled innovation and created an uneven playing field, among other negative consequences. SEC’s Shift From ‘First-To-File’ Principle Signals Favoritism: ETF Issuers In an email addressed to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins on June 5, CEOs of VanEck , 21Shares and Canary Capital in the persons of Jan van Eck, Duncan Moir, and Steven McClurg outlined a deep grievance with the Commission’s abandonment of its first-to-file principle and the adoption of simultaneous approval approach towards recent ETP applications. The letter explained that the “first-to-file” rule acted as a strong pillar of fairness which supported innovation, and a first-mover advantage. This approval model allegedly created a competitive market landscape as smaller asset managers were able to seize significant market shares of a particular product to increase their general standing. A statement from the letter explains: …If multiple sponsors were working in parallel on similar ideas, those filing first were first in line to receive market approval. This has enabled the ETP industry to grow to $15.4 trillion in investor assets. Newer, innovative companies like Wisdomtree have been able to become industry leaders; it’s not necessarily established mutual fund companies that have gained high ETP market share. However, the head executives at VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital explain that the SEC’s shift to a simultaneous approval method as seen with the Bitcoin spot ETFs and Ethereum spot ETFs in 2024 completely undermines the need for innovation in the ETP industry. They also strongly claim that this approach signals a favouritism towards bigger asset managers who are able to comfortably copy the products of other firms with an assurance of securing the same launch date from the Commission. While Van Eck, Moir and McClurg acknowledge the potential reasons for simultaneous approval such as reducing the work burden on the Commission’s staff, they maintain the “first-to-file” is integral to upholding the regulatory integrity of the US ETP market. They urge a swift return to this governance standard which they claim will ensure financial innovation, creativity and competition. Crypto Market Overview At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.22 trillion following a 2.41% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, total trading volume currently stands at $109.06 billion.",SEC|21Shares|Canary Capital|first-to-file|Paul Atkins|vaneck,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-08 01:00:29

However, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin will ultimately dictate the move. Keeping a close eye on the intraday chart, the expert mentioned that an early pullback could present a scalp opportunity, as long as Bitcoin aligns with the bullish outlook. Breakout Likely With Strong Daily Candles Breaking down his latest analysis, the trader explained that LINK’s daily candle officially closed bullish, marking a key technical point in the current trend. Meanwhile, LINKBTC ended the session on a positive note, which adds weight to the bullish outlook for LINK in the short term. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus However, the analyst emphasized that more bullish daily closes on LINKBTC are needed to confirm momentum. A continuation of strength could lead to an impulsive breakout above the daily candle’s lower high trendline, igniting the next leg upward. A decisive move above the 0.000140 BTC resistance zone is expected to accelerate price action for LINK, giving bulls a clear signal to push higher. If momentum continues to build, LINK could rally toward the $16 resistance level, marking a major target for the current setup. For now, $12.50 remains a key support level on the daily timeframe and will act as a cushion if bearish pressure reemerges. Looking ahead, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Dominance will remain the primary market drivers for Chainlink heading into the weekend. While maintaining a rational outlook, CRYPTOWZRD plans to monitor LINK’s intraday chart closely for any developing setups. Awaiting Chainlink Next Trade Setup In conclusion, CRYPTOWZRD emphasized that LINK’s intraday chart is showing signs of a bullish recovery, closely aligned with Bitcoin’s recent rebound. He expressed optimism that further upside is likely if current conditions persist, particularly if Bitcoin maintains its strength. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent? Despite the encouraging signs, CRYPTOWZRD noted that a temporary bearish pullback would be both natural and healthy within the current market context. Pullbacks often reset market conditions, providing better structure for stronger continuation patterns. He believes such a retracement could offer a favorable early entry point for long positions, especially for short-term or intraday traders looking to capitalize on the volatility. As the market continues to evolve, CRYPTOWZRD advises traders to wait for clear confirmation of the next trade setup before taking action. His statement emphasized that strategic patience will be key in identifying the most rewarding opportunities. For now, traders should track price behavior closely and prepare to act swiftly when the next valid entry signal presents itself.

In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) faces uncertainty as it hovers near 0.16, and leverage in the market stays high. With whale activity declining and little FOMO among traders, DOGE’s short-term future looks shaky. In the middle of this, Web3 ai ($WAI) offers something different. It’s not about hype, it’s about usable AI tools. Its $WAI token is priced at just $0.000402 in Stage 7. With a listing price of $0.005242, that’s a possible return of up to 1,747%. Already, it has raised over $6.8 million, making it one of the strongest AI crypto projects heading into 2025. Cardano (ADA) Eyes Breakout at $0.48 Cardano (ADA) is trading close to $0.46 and testing a key level. If it can close above $0.48, a quick rally to $0.52 could follow. Current charts show ADA building support near $0.44, suggesting some strength is holding. Traders are watching closely to see if bullish energy pushes it over the line. Its ability to upgrade smart contracts keeps ADA on many people’s radar. But like all altcoins, its direction still depends on the broader crypto market. If the overall trend stays positive, ADA could draw more interest from traders looking for gains in both the short and long term. Dogecoin Holds $0.16 as Traders Stay Cautious Dogecoin (DOGE) is under pressure at the $0.16 level. Leverage remains high, and the price risks a drop if support breaks. While DOGE is known for its fast rallies, things feel different this time. Retail interest has slowed, and the usual FOMO seems missing. Open interest in futures is still strong, showing many traders are betting big. But if DOGE falls lower, those bets could cause a chain of liquidations. Fewer whale moves on-chain point to reduced major buys, adding to the weak mood. DOGE may still bounce, but it’s in a tight spot for now. The next move likely depends on fresh momentum or a market-wide lift. Web3 ai Gains Traction with $6.8M Raised and 1,747% ROI Setup Web3 ai is quickly rising as one of the top crypto coins by offering real tools instead of vague promises. Unlike many AI projects that only discuss future features, Web3 ai already provides working systems designed to help users in the crypto space. These include tools for tracking risk in real-time, managing trades, and setting smart alerts, all of which are powered through its native $WAI token. Currently in Stage 7 of its presale, $WAI is priced at just $0.000402. The listing price is locked at $0.005242, presenting an estimated 1,747% return for early buyers. So far, Web3 ai has raised over $6.8 million, proving strong belief in its long-term value. What sets it apart is that every function in its ecosystem depends on $WAI to operate, giving the token actual use, not just speculation. The roadmap also hints at broader ambitions. Users can expect advanced features like NFT analytics, SDK tools, and wallet integration post-listing. All updates will roll out after the token goes live on exchanges. Experts believe that with growing adoption, $WAI could aim for a $4 valuation. For those seeking utility-backed coins under one cent, Web3 ai stands out as a solid bullish crypto opportunity. Summing Up! While ADA moves with the market and DOGE fights against leverage, Web3 ai is quietly attracting serious attention. All of its features rely on $WAI. This built-in use ensures the token grows as more users join the system. ADA and DOGE mostly depend on trends or social energy. But $WAI depends on actual use. That’s a significant difference. If the platform performs well post-launch, hitting long-term price targets like $4 seems more realistic. As the market looks for top crypto coins with real value under one cent, Web3 ai’s package of working tools, smart pricing, and strong demand makes it stand out.

In a filing , lawyers for BiT Global, an entity backed by TRON founder Justin Sun, who last year became a strategic partner to BitGo in providing the wBTC-wrapped Bitcoin token, said they had agreed to dismiss the suit with prejudice. This means the case cannot be brought again. Additionally, the two companies each said they would incur their own legal expenses in connection with the complaint Sun’s link to wBTC caused ETH DeFi protocols to stop supporting it as a collateral asset Wrapped Bitcoin tokens facilitate the use of Bitcoin on various blockchain networks. Both wBTC and cbBTC target the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the tokens do not offer any direct claim to the Bitcoin unless one trusts a central intermediary to custody the Bitcoin and release the wrapped token. Sun’s association with wBTC caused Ethereum DeFi protocols MakerDAO and Aave to contemplate disintegrating the support of the token as a collateral asset, ultimately deciding on tougher risk parameters rather than a complete exit. According to reports from credible sources, the lawsuit was filed in December 2024 by Kneupper & Covey on behalf of BiT Global, and it was claimed that if Coinbase delisted wBTC, it would be an example of anti-competitive behavior. It would also break several state and federal laws. The suit highlighted that having demonstrated the value represented by wBTC, Coinbase reversed course and removed wBTC from its platform. This made it impossible for anyone to trade it on Coinbase. The change came shortly after they launched their own similar version: cbBTC. Following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s top lawyer, stated that this important win affirms their clear right to manage security and risk for Coinbase users. Grewal added, “…we will not be bullied into continuing to list an asset that puts our customers at risk.” Previously, the exchange’s chief legal officer had defended its approach, stressing its dedication to high listing standards. He wrote on an X post that when an asset does not meet their listing standards anymore, they remove it. He further stated that they would add it to their list if another asset could meet or do better than market requirements while still following those standards. Grewal’s post faced criticism from crypto-industry insiders, including Tron founder Justin Sun, who accused the company of lacking transparency and asked how Grewal’s post squared with previous comments by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. An attached image provided by Sun depicted a screenshot of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who says Coinbase was agnostic to assets because it believes that consumers deserve options in the crypto economy. Mike Belshe defends BitGo as having a solid reputation after Sun’s backlash Earlier legal attempts to stop Coinbase from delisting the token were unsuccessful after a federal judge in December sided with Coinbase and said it had the right to delist the token. The transfer of wBTC from being managed only by the custody company BitGo to a partnership involving Sun faced backlash from people in the cryptocurrency world. In response to this criticism, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe revealed that he believes BitGo has a solid reputation because they follow the highest security standards in everything they do. Belshe concluded that Ultimately, he thinks people will see that this is not a big deal. The current market capitalization for the wBTC token is about $13.6 billion, with Coinbase’s cbBTC valued at about $4.7 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Both of these tokens are almost at an all-time high market cap.

The buzz around the top cryptos to join for 2025 opportunities intensifies as traders and enthusiasts seek projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications. Qubetics has emerged as a promising contender in this environment, capturing attention for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its potential to reshape decentralized finance. As the search for the top cryptos to join for 2025 projects heats up, established tokens like Polkadot and Stacks also demonstrate resilience and steady growth. Each of these coins plays a distinctive role in the evolving crypto ecosystem, whether through exchange token utility, supply chain transparency, or multi-chain interoperability. These dynamics are creating a fertile ground for projects that can deliver both technological innovation and practical adoption. The quest for the top cryptos to join for 2025 is more than a race for early gains; it reflects a demand for projects that solve long-standing blockchain inefficiencies while preparing for the future of digital finance. Qubetics stands at the forefront of this movement, offering solutions that address interoperability challenges, enhance security, and streamline cross-chain asset management. This makes it an essential project to watch as blockchain networks grow increasingly interconnected. Qubetics: Bridging Blockchain Interoperability and Unlocking the top cryptos to join for 2025 in 2025 Qubetics ($TICS) continues to carve a compelling niche by tackling one of blockchain’s most persistent hurdles: interoperability. Its crypto presale , currently in the 37th stage, has seen over 515 million tokens sold to upwards of 27,500 holders, raising more than $17.7 million. The token is priced at $0.3370 during this stage, providing an attractive entry point into a project built on solid technological foundations and ambitious goals. Only 10 million $TICS tokens remain in Stage 37 of the Qubetics presale, priced at $0.3370. With over 515M tokens sold and $17.7M+ raised, this is your final opportunity before a 20% price increase at launch. Qubetics has slashed its supply to 1.36B, creating rare scarcity. Act now—or miss out. Recent developments showcase Qubetics’ growing ecosystem, notably through the QubeQode platform and the Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These tools empower decentralized app developers and businesses to build cross-chain solutions with enhanced security features. Introducing a decentralized VPN further strengthens user privacy and secure communications, addressing concerns plaguing many contemporary blockchain networks. Polkadot: Connecting Blockchain Networks Through Parachain Innovation Polkadot is a leading multi-chain network that enables different blockchains to transfer messages and assets trustless. Developed by Web3 Foundation and co-founded by Ethereum co-creator Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot uses a unique relay chain mechanism to connect independent blockchains, known as parachains, allowing them to operate seamlessly within one ecosystem. This design eliminates bottlenecks and boosts scalability, making Polkadot one of the most forward-thinking Layer-0 solutions. The platform’s native token, DOT, is used for governance, staking, and bonding parachains—making it an essential component for ecosystem participation. Recent developments in the Polkadot ecosystem include accelerated adoption of parachain slots and increased community funding for decentralized applications (dApps). The network has seen a surge in developer activity, especially after the rollout of OpenGov, which offers decentralized on-chain governance to token holders. As Polkadot continues to emphasize interoperability and composability, it is increasingly viewed as a foundational layer for next-generation decentralized infrastructure. With over 550 active projects building on its ecosystem, Polkadot remains a top contender for scalable blockchain solutions in 2025. Stacks: Powering Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Web3 Utility Stacks is a unique Layer-1 blockchain that brings smart contract functionality and decentralized applications to Bitcoin without modifying the original Bitcoin protocol. By using a novel Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, Stacks anchors its security to Bitcoin’s robust network while allowing developers to build smart contracts using its Clarity language. The native token, STX, fuels transaction fees, smart contract execution, and participation in network consensus—creating a full-circle economy around Bitcoin-enabled DeFi and NFTs. The Stacks ecosystem has gained momentum recently due to increasing interest in Bitcoin Layer-2 scalability solutions and the rising demand for decentralized identity and finance on Bitcoin. With Stacks 2.1 now live and features like sBTC (a two-way pegged Bitcoin asset) under development, the platform is positioned to unlock a new era of programmable Bitcoin. This has sparked renewed enthusiasm among builders and institutions aiming to tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity with added functionality. As Bitcoin adoption grows globally, Stacks is seen as a vital bridge between Bitcoin’s store-of-value strength and modern decentralized use cases. Interoperability: Easing Blockchain Integration for All Users Interoperability remains central to Qubetics’ vision, delivering tangible benefits to businesses, professionals, and individuals alike: Businesses: Enable seamless multi-chain asset management and decentralized application integration, reducing operational complexity and costs. Professionals: Provide secure, private communication channels and collaborative environments powered by decentralized VPNs. Individuals: Grant users greater control over digital assets across different blockchain networks, fostering financial inclusivity and privacy. By simplifying interoperability, Qubetics lowers the barrier to blockchain adoption, encouraging ecosystem growth and innovative solutions that traditional finance systems struggle to match.

It is one of the most closely monitored cases as the court decides whether selling XRP broke US securities laws. When people thought the case was finally over after Ripple and the SEC agreed to a joint settlement, District Judge Analisa Torres rejected the request because it wasn’t filed correctly under court rules. This minor setback looks like a procedural delay to some people, but others think it proves the legal system isn’t ready to handle cryptocurrency-related cases and that even the SEC is confused about applying decades-old financial laws to brand-new technologies. What happened in the Ripple vs. SEC case? The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs in December 2020 for breaking investor protection laws that apply to stocks or bonds by raising $1.3 billion from selling XRP tokens without registering them as securities. Ripple fought back, saying XRP is not a security but a digital currency, but Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that Ripple violated securities laws when it sold XRP directly to institutional investors like hedge funds and investment firms. She said the deals still involved investment contracts categorized under federal securities regulations and penalized Ripple with a $125 million fine plus restrictions on structured sales of XRP to institutions in the future. However, Ripple and the SEC reached a new agreement to reduce the penalty to $50 million and remove the restrictions in 2024, but the judge rejected their request because it wasn’t filed using the correct legal format. Why did the Judge really say no to the deal? Judge Analisa Torres rejected the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC because their legal process didn’t follow Rule 60. The rule only allows changes to final judgments if there are rare and exceptional circumstances like new evidence, fraud, or serious procedural mistakes. The judge said Ripple and the SEC just wanted to change the fine amount and remove restrictions after reaching a new agreement without a strong enough reason to meet that high legal standard. The cryptocurrency community thinks this setback shows that the current legal system is slow and rigid regarding blockchain because deals, innovations, and market reactions move in real-time. At the same time, court rulings and settlement approvals can take months or even years. This means investors will remain confused, token prices will fluctuate based on rumors, and the cryptocurrency community will speculate over future agreements in court simply because small procedural mistakes in the legal system can cause big delays. Crypto regulation still has no clear path The Ripple case is just one example of a bigger problem in how the rules for regulating cryptocurrencies remain unclear because the SEC sometimes pushes for huge penalties, and other times, it quietly drops charges with very little explanation. For example, the agency sued Kraken and Coinbase for selling investment products that weren’t registered under securities laws but recently dropped the cases after striking deals that seem to change the rules case by case. The SEC also accused Terraform Labs of damages after its TerraUSD stablecoin collapsed and wiped out billions of dollars from the market but still settled with a small penalty. These events make people wonder how enforcement decisions are really made and whether they reflect a fair or consistent set of standards when the damage caused appears far greater than in Ripple’s situation. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC still apply old rules (some written in the 1930s or 1940s) to brand blockchains, stablecoins, and smart contracts because Congress hasn’t passed any major law that gives them authority to oversee digital assets. It’s no wonder judges are unsure about what legal standards apply in these complex disputes, developers remain confused about how to build legal products, and investors don’t know what to invest in. Cryptocurrency firms strugg le to balance growth ambitions with regulatory risks Cryptocurrency companies face a dilemma where they either keep their operations small and limited to avoid attracting regulatory trouble or push for growth and innovation. However, they risk facing costly lawsuits and enforcement actions from the SEC because there aren’t clear rules. Ripple’s long and expensive legal battle shows how challenging it is for any firm to survive this uncertain regulatory environment, especially smaller startups that simply cannot afford such costly and time-consuming fights. The judge’s rejection of the Ripple and the SEC settlement was grounded in procedural laws but still felt like a missed opportunity to end a prolonged and exhausting saga because their agreement was a rare moment of cooperation that many hoped would bring clear guidance. And just like that, organizations, investors, and regulators don’t know how to move forward with innovation while staying compliant with the law. Ripple’s legal battle highlights urgent need for clear crypto regulation Ripple can still refile their motion correctly using Rule 60 (b) but will have to spend more time in court while investors remain nervous and developers cautious because XRP prices fluctuate sharply with each new headline about the case. Regulators haven’t also said when or how tokens like XRP will be officially classified and regulated under the law. This has turned the entire Ripple case into a complex, drawn-out saga that still leaves more questions than answers about the future of crypto regulation and enforcement. The watchdogs must act quickly and communicate openly to keep pace with digital finance because cryptocurrency communities urgently need clear guardrails to operate safely and know how to apply them to plan and grow without sudden legal problems.

The premier cryptocurrency, which had traded steadily within the $104,000–$106,000 range throughout the week, plunged to below $101,000 as tensions escalated between the two influential figures who attacked each other via their personally owned social media platforms i.e. X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social. Since then, Bitcoin has shown some market resilience climbing back to around $104,000. With another consolidation developing, market analyst Crypto Daan has highlighted the price levels that are critical to the next price breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 – Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Beyond $106K Or Below $100K – What’s Next For Bitcoin? The month of May proved largely bullish for Bitcoin as the digital asset surged from around $95,000 to establish a new all-time high near $112,000 marking the resumption of the larger crypto bull market. However, Bitcoin has noted a significant price correction since reaching this peak with market prices pegged around $104,000 on May 31. As seen in the first week of June, Bitcoin had hovered around $106,000 before its most recent price slump on Thursday. Due to this price action, Daan Crypto notes the digital asset is now trading within a price range of $100,000-$106,000, where it comfortably sits at the mid-range around $104,000. The analyst notes that if Bitcoin returns break below the lower range boundary at $100,000, the ongoing price correction could extend for 1-2 weeks. Going by BTC’s stairwell ascent in the past month, potential market support in such a bearish case would lie around $95,000 and $85,000. On the other hand, if the market bulls can force a return above the monthly high of $106,000, Daan Crypto explains that such development would indicate the market correction is over, and Bitcoin may be headed for another price discovery with potential initial targets of around $120,000.

Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index on the daily chart stands at 51.53 facing upward which supports the notion that Bitcoin’s correction might be over with price eyeing a return to the overbought zone above 70. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the world’s largest cryptocurrency and fifth largest asset in the world.

What’s fueling this demand? Artificial intelligence. However, it’s pretty clear the current energy grid is already stretched thin, struggling to meet electricity demands. Add anything more, and it might just buckle. More pressure on the energy infrastructure could translate into hiked power bills, brownouts, and blackouts for the American public. Worse still, if the grid can’t supply enough energy, it could bring the tech industry to a halt, potentially stifling AI development before companies can even begin to explore half of its possibilities. The US is still dealing with aged energy infrastructure in key states According to IEA’s analysis, data centers used up 415 TWh in 2024, about 1.5% of global electricity consumption, and AI servers accounted for a hefty share of that. Per their report, AI servers alone made up 24% of server electricity use and 15% of total data center energy demand last year. That’s a staggering footprint for a technology still in its early stages—and it’s only expected to grow moving forward. Alex de Vries, a researcher at VU Amsterdam and the founder of Digiconomist, believes the IEA’s figures are underestimated, calling their AI stats a bit vague. Goldman Sachs also made their projections, estimating that AI data centers could burn through 165% more power; even Arm’s CEO warned that AI might use 25% of US electricity by 2030. Sounds a bit dramatic, but the real question is, can the country handle the future energy demands of AI? The government certainly believes so, seeing that it already started issuing incentives and implementing new regulations both at the federal and state levels. For instance, in April, President Trump signed executive orders to fast-track coal energy production —supposedly to meet the AI industry’s soaring power demands because reviving fossil fuels in 2025 is the answer. Well, analysts aren’t exactly thrilled with the president’s decision. Many doubt it’ll even be enough, and environmentalist backlash is only getting worse. Focusing on fossil fuels like natural gas or coal could alleviate the AI power crisis, but building new fossil fuel-powered facilities may take at least three to five years. If we are talking nuclear plants, it could take even longer, roughly seven to 15 years. Furthermore, renewables like solar and wind require costly battery storage to maintain steady power for AI data centers. Not to mention, multiple transmission lines and substations in several states are over 50 years old. Talk about ancient; some even date back to the 19th century, particularly in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago, which begs the question, is there really a method to cater to AI power demands, or should companies rethink their tech development strategies? CEO Michael Polsky asks the government to provide support to power developers. The US is still very focused on beating China in developing artificial intelligence. However, if it stands a chance to win, it would need to invest in power superhighways to move large quantities of electricity, according to Invenergy LLC Chief Executive Officer Michael Polsky. He argues that establishing a national transmission activity to set up high-voltage lines could even expedite the process. His words: “I do believe it’s an emergency because of how difficult it is to build things. We don’t have decades to figure this out. We have years.” Additionally, he suggested the government offer support to power developers as it does for others like Musk and his spaceships. He claimed they should also be fairly compensated for their investments. However, the Trump administration seems hell-bent on budget cuts, especially on clean energy power developers. Just last month, the government cut off nearly $4 billion in support from some clean energy projects. Not to mention, Invenergy’s Grain Belt Express project funding could be next on the chopping block, meaning it could potentially lose about $11 billion that could transmit 5 gigawatts of power across 800 miles. Nonetheless, Invenergy President Jim Murphy believes the government will still fund their project. Polsky even argued that their project was of national concern.",OP-ED|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-08 03:30:41

But while most projects stick to claims, BlockDAG is focused on delivery. Instead of relying on flashy buzzwords, it’s putting tools in users’ hands and building real traction. With more than $289 million raised, 22 billion BDAG distributed, and a growing user base of over 1.5 million on its X1 app, BlockDAG is shifting from concept to functioning platform. Its success is rooted in a blend of familiar crypto foundations and user-first tools. So what makes BlockDAG (BDAG) more than just another Layer 1? And why does its mobile-first model matter so much for future blockchain adoption? A Different Kind of Chain Built for Performance BlockDAG’s name reflects its design. Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on a single chain of blocks, it uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. That means it can handle many blocks at the same time, instead of one by one. This approach offers a clear speed advantage. With parallel processing and no bottlenecks, BlockDAG supports fast transaction speeds and low latency. And it doesn’t trade off security, thanks to its Proof-of-Work mechanism. It’s also compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so developers can bring over existing Ethereum dApps without major changes. It’s not trying to replace Ethereum, but rather offer a faster, more flexible space to build or expand. X1 App Makes Mobile Mining Simple and Popular While the tech side draws in developers, BlockDAG’s X1 app is what’s attracting everyday users. It’s available for both Android and iOS and lets people mine BDAG from their phones, no fancy hardware, no steep learning curve. You just tap the app once a day to start earning, with a maximum of 20 BDAG daily. It runs on a Proof-of-Engagement model, which rewards participation rather than processing power. That keeps it light, energy-efficient, and accessible to everyone. Features like a referral system and global leaderboard make it fun and competitive. These social elements have helped the app grow rapidly, turning it into a go-to entry point for people new to crypto. But X1 is not stopping at mining. It’s evolving into a full Web3 hub, with upcoming tools for NFT minting, smart contract testing, and BDAG transfers, all inside the same app. That shift toward a complete mobile crypto toolkit is key. In areas where phones are more common than computers, a mobile-ready platform lowers the barrier to entry and opens the door to widespread use. Community Growth Driven by Real Engagement Beyond its tech and usability, BlockDAG’s momentum comes from its community. Its presale has become one of the most successful in crypto, already raising more than $289 million over 45 stages. A big part of that success is Buyer Battles, a campaign where the top buyer of the day gets the remaining BDAG from that day’s allocation, up to 150 million. So far, these daily wins have added up to $1.26 million in bonus BDAG. This approach beats traditional marketing. By giving users real rewards, BlockDAG turns early supporters into active participants who help grow the project organically. For builders, BlockDAG has launched a Developer Hub that includes tools like a Smart Contract Wizard, an IDE, and Testnet access. These tools are already live, so teams can start building without waiting. The Primordial Testnet is up and running, giving developers a place to test dApps, run contracts, and fine-tune performance. As more features roll out, teams will be able to simulate mainnet conditions and scale with confidence. This mix of users, miners, and developers working together is what makes BlockDAG’s larger vision real, a shared platform where growth isn’t limited to one group. Closing Thoughts BlockDAG isn’t chasing headlines, it’s focused on progress. While other projects talk big, BlockDAG is actually launching tools, attracting users, and building an ecosystem that works. With $289 million raised, 1.5 million users on the X1 app, and developer tools already live, it’s clear this isn’t just hype. It’s user-driven growth backed by real technology. Whether it’s the simplicity of mining on a phone or the flexibility of its EVM-compatible architecture, BlockDAG is moving forward with a clear goal, to bring more people into crypto without making it complicated. And as phones replace mining rigs, and users replace speculators, BlockDAG might be showing what real adoption looks like.

Bitcoin traded at $105,000, while Ethereum’s price moved to $2,500. This article looks at some of the top trending coins like Ravencoin, AB, and Keeta. Ravencoin price analysis Ravencoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency created as a hard fork of Bitcoin. Its main difference with Bitcoin is that it has a supply cap of 21 billion, while Bitcoin has 21 million. RVN price surged recently after Upbit, the biggest South Korean exchange, listed it, giving it access to millions of customers. It moved to a high of $0.0257, the highest point since December last year, and then pulled back to $0.01570. Ravencoin price remains slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01428, the highest swing on May 13. It has also jumped above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a sign that bulls remain in control. Ravencoin price chart Ravencoin token also remains above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level, while the MACD is pointing upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the 38.2% retracement point at $0.01912. A drop below the support at $0.0142 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Read more: Ravencoin (RVN) is pumping? Is it about Litecoin ETF speculation? AB price forecast AB is a blockchain project that offers a modular technology that supports fast and secure transactions, smart contract execution, and decentralized governance. The AB token price has jumped recently following its listing on several exchanges like Binance, Bitget, and MEXC. It has also done well as on-chain data shows that its network is starting to gow, albeit from a low base. AB has handled over 1.5 million blocks since inception and 29,792 transactions. It is handling about 2.6k transactions a day, while addresses have risen to 23,6111. However, its network utilization remains at 0.01%, meaning that it needs to supercharge its growth to justify its valuation. The daily chart shows that the AB price bottomed at $0.004084 on May 26 and then bounced back to $0.01040. It has moved slightly above the key resistance level at $0.01. The highest point on May 28. AB token price chart The Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, technicals suggest that the AB token will continue rising as bulls target $0.015. However, AB is a thinly traded token, meaning that it may have extreme moves on some days. Keeta price forecast Keeta is a blockchain network that delivers over 10 million transactions per second. Its goal is to unify the blockchain industry by enabling users to move assets across multiple chains. It also lets users to create tokens that represent real-world assets. The two-hour chart shows that the Keeta token price has done well in the past few days as it moved to a record high of $1.4920, up 262% from its lowest point this year. Keeta token recently moved above the key resistance level at $1.2400, its highest point on June 3. Moving above that level invalidated the double-top pattern that was forming. Keeta price chart It has also retested that level, pointing to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $2. A drop below the support at $1.2400 will invalidate the bullish Keeta price forecast.

The tweet was accompanied by a table outlining six critical differences between the two systems, focusing on technology, settlement methods, transaction speed, cost, use of intermediaries, and regulatory environment. Technology: Centralization Versus Decentralization The chart shared by XRP Update highlights a fundamental difference in the underlying architecture of SWIFT and XRP. SWIFT is described as a centralized messaging system, responsible for facilitating interbank communication rather than moving actual funds. It depends on the cooperation of multiple financial institutions across jurisdictions, creating a dependency on centralized governance and infrastructure. In contrast, XRP operates on a decentralized blockchain protocol, where transactions can be verified, validated, and settled across a distributed network. XRP Update points to decentralization as a key advantage. Decentralized systems are less vulnerable to single points of failure, more transparent in operation, and can process transactions without needing complex institutional approval chains. The post implies that XRP’s architecture is more aligned with modern demands for open, secure, and globally accessible financial systems. KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN $XRP & #SWIFT $XRP IS THE BEST OPTION pic.twitter.com/pnGIEvyhGF — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) June 6, 2025 Settlement and Speed: Instant Finality Versus Delays Another major distinction outlined in the post involves the settlement process. SWIFT facilitates a sequential settlement model through correspondent banks, which often introduces multiple layers of coordination, time delays, and operational risk. These settlements can take anywhere from one to five days to complete, depending on the jurisdictions and intermediaries involved. XRP Update emphasizes that XRP offers direct and instant settlement. The blockchain processes transactions within seconds and offers immediate finality without passing through various institutions. This ability to settle in real-time is a direct response to the inefficiencies of legacy systems. It addresses major concerns in cross-border payments, such as liquidity management and reconciliation delays. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cost and Intermediaries: Reducing Fees and Friction XRP Update also points to cost as a major differentiating factor. SWIFT’s dependency on a network of correspondent banks naturally introduces additional fees, including processing charges, FX spreads, and administrative costs. These expenses are typically passed on to consumers or business users, making cross-border transfers significantly more expensive than domestic ones. XRP’s system, as highlighted in the tweet, is designed to eliminate most of these intermediaries. By eliminating the need for correspondent banks, XRP not only reduces the time required to transfer money internationally but also the associated costs. The tweet suggests this leads to a more affordable and efficient global payment experience, especially for financial institutions and fintech companies seeking to optimize cross-border operations. Legacy Acceptance Versus Modern Challenges The final point in the comparison table addresses regulatory status. SWIFT benefits from well-established regulatory recognition, having operated within the traditional financial system for decades. XRP, on the other hand, continues to face regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States. XRP Update acknowledges this difference but does not portray it as a disadvantage that outweighs the benefits. Instead, the post implicitly argues that regulatory uncertainty is temporary and that XRP’s technical advantages will eventually drive broader acceptance. Despite ongoing regulatory hurdles, the tweet positions XRP as not only a viable but optimal choice for the future of cross-border payments. With growing institutional interest in blockchain solutions, XRP’s technical attributes continue to gain relevance, especially in a financial system increasingly defined by speed, efficiency, and global interoperability.

Here’s Why Qubetics Might Be the Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now,https://thecoinrise.com/still-holding-btc-or-bnb-heres-why-qubetics-might-be-the-best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now/,"Blockchain just took another leap forward. The latest ETH L2 updates are slashing gas fees, and institutions are quietly increasing exposure to digital assets. Meanwhile, newer protocols are drawing in massive TVLs, showing that innovation is sprinting ahead. With the world edging closer to digital-first finance, traditional assets like stocks and bonds aren’t holding the same charm they once did. Instead, crypto projects with strong fundamentals and active communities are emerging as the preferred alternative for everyday buyers. And speaking of strong contenders, Qubetics is gaining serious traction. Positioned at the front of the new digital frontier, Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, fusing tools and services that power decentralized living. In a world that’s more digitally dependent than ever, this project doesn’t just ride the crypto wave—it builds the next one. Let’s compare Qubetics with the OGs: Bitcoin and BNB, and see which is the best cheap crypto to buy now. How Qubetics’ dVPN Could Be the Breakthrough Web3 Needs Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional VPNs, offering censorship resistance, enhanced privacy, and user-driven infrastructure. However, despite their promise, most dVPN solutions today face critical challenges. These include poor user experience, limited network reach, low speeds due to fragmented node quality, and high technical barriers for both node operators and users. Many projects also suffer from weak economic incentives, making it difficult to maintain active, reliable nodes at scale. For the average user, setting up or navigating a dVPN can still feel overly complex and unreliable—limiting real-world adoption. Qubetics addresses these limitations by integrating dVPN functionality into its broader Web3 framework, enabling faster, more reliable, and user-friendly decentralized private networking. Its ecosystem is designed for seamless access—where users can connect to privacy-first routing infrastructure without managing complex setups or relying on underperforming node networks. Qubetics uses a token-based model that rewards node operators fairly while ensuring network stability and scalability. It also supports cross-chain integration and real-time performance validation, allowing users to connect securely across regions and protocols with confidence. For developers and enterprises, Qubetics offers SDK-level access to embed dVPN features directly into decentralized applications, making privacy not just an option, but a default layer within Web3 architecture. Final Presale Stage: From $0.01 to $0.3370—Last Chance Before Listing Qubetics began its presale journey at just $0.01 in Stage 1. Now in Stage 37, the final crypto presale stage, the token is priced at $0.3370, having raised over $17.7 million, distributed 515 million tokens, and attracted 27,500+ holders. Once this final allocation is sold out, $TICS will list publicly at $0.40, offering an immediate return of 18.71% to those buying in now. At the current rate, a $5,000 investment secures approximately 14,837 tokens. If the token reaches $1 post-launch, the value grows to $14,837. At $5, it climbs to $74,185. If it hits $10 or $15, the valuation jumps to $148,370 and $222,555 respectively. With the token supply reduced to 1.36 billion and 38.55% reserved for public distribution, Qubetics offers a rare mix of scarcity, utility, and early-mover advantage. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price—after that, the public market takes over. Bitcoin (BTC): The Unshakable Digital Reserve It’s the original, the heavyweight, the symbol of decentralized money. Still, it has earned its title as digital gold. It’s held by thousands of major buyers, corporate treasuries, and individual wallets worldwide, and it’s got the battle scars to prove it. Bitcoin’s value isn’t just in price. It’s in its network security, its first-mover advantage, and its unmatched decentralization. When markets shake, many still rush to Bitcoin. It’s a mainstay in the digital asset space, but for those scouting for the best cheap crypto to buy now, BTC might be more of a long-term stronghold than a near-term multiplier. The days of 1,000 percent gains might be in the rearview, but for those who want stability in a sea of volatility, Bitcoin continues to be the go-to. BNB (Binance Coin): The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem BNB started as a utility token and grew into the glue holding the Binance ecosystem together. Whether it’s paying fees on Binance Smart Chain, participating in launches, or powering DeFi and NFT platforms, BNB is everywhere. BNB’s community is huge, with millions of users relying on it for day-to-day transactions across DeFi apps, staking protocols, and token swaps. That kind of use gives BNB real-world weight. It isn’t just speculative—it’s integral to daily blockchain use. But for new backers hunting the best cheap crypto to buy now, BNB may feel a bit pricey compared to tokens like $TICS, especially if the goal is catching early-stage growth. Still, its track record is solid. BNB exploded from a few dollars to hundreds in just a few years, proving that exchange-based tokens can become major players in the space. And with Binance constantly evolving, BNB remains a dependable bet for those looking for something with both utility and staying power. Why Qubetics Is Grabbing All the Spotlight Right Now The ongoing crypto presale of Qubetics has created a ripple effect in crypto circles for a reason. It’s not just about the potential gains. It’s about relevance. This project hits where modern issues lie—privacy, decentralization, access, and usability. Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, simplifying the decentralized experience into something anyone can use. Think about all the different services out there: VPNs, DeFi wallets, staking platforms, DEXs, aggregators, identity verification. Qubetics brings them under one roof with actual use cases. You’re not just holding a token—you’re part of a platform that does real work in the real world. That’s why it’s being seen as the best cheap crypto to buy now by early adopters who understand where tech is headed. Whether you’re someone who’s sick of handing your data over to centralized services or a professional needing secure, borderless communication, Qubetics delivers. And with each presale stage pushing the price up, those watching from the sidelines are starting to feel the heat. Once this thing hits exchanges, the whole vibe could shift fast. Final Thoughts: Ready or Not, Qubetics Is Coming 2025 isn’t the year to play it safe with tired assets. Between rising inflation and a digital-first future knocking at the door, there’s a growing call for assets that are nimble, tech-forward, and built for where the world is going, not where it’s been. Bitcoin holds the crown for being the pioneer. BNB has cemented its spot in the daily use category. But Qubetics? It’s making a serious case for being the best cheap crypto to buy now , especially for those tuned into real utility and tangible future gains. With massive presale momentum, promising ROI projections, and a platform tackling real-world problems, it’s not just a project—it’s a movement. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, now’s the moment. The train’s still at the station—but it won’t be for long.

The evidence presented supports the argument that scalability, cost-efficiency, and regulatory compatibility are critical for any digital asset to be integrated into institutional-grade financial systems. On all of these fronts, XRP significantly outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum. Scalability Bottlenecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum Scalability, in the context of global payments, refers to the system’s ability to handle millions of transactions simultaneously with speed, reliability, and minimal cost. According to data cited in the images attached to the tweet, both Bitcoin and Ethereum process fewer than 20 transactions per second. This is a major constraint considering that modern banking infrastructure must scale to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. As noted by IBM’s Lund, while newer systems are achieving up to 4,000 transactions per second in experimental setups, legacy blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain severely limited by their foundational architecture. WHY BTC AND ETH WILL NEVER COMPETE WITH XRP IN GLOBAL PAYMENTS Scalability means how well a system can handle lots of transactions at the same time, quickly and without high costs. Banks need this because they process millions of payments every day that must be fast and… https://t.co/N5tjg8GZ64 pic.twitter.com/PnuiSqLZc1 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 Regulatory and Operational Incompatibility The high volatility and low scalability of BTC and ETH are further highlighted in academic literature. A 2022 publication available on Springer concludes that these assets are unsuitable as payment instruments in most distributed ledger technology (DLT) use cases due to these very limitations. Their underlying proof-of-work consensus mechanisms not only limit throughput but also make transaction confirmation times longer and energy consumption unsustainable. These technical deficiencies also create complications for compliance within regulated financial environments, further disqualifying BTC and ETH from institutional adoption in global payment systems. XRP’s Technical Design for Institutional Use In contrast, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is cited in a separate academic paper on the EDISON-X energy trading system as an example of a DLT built for fast, low-cost, and scalable payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRPL uses a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism, which enables transaction finality in 3–4 seconds, with a cost of less than $0.001 per transaction and the capacity to handle up to 1,500 transactions per second. These attributes make XRP suitable not only for peer-to-peer payments but also for enterprise-level applications such as energy trading and cross-border financial settlement. Institutional Preferences and Real-World Integration Furthermore, the scalability and low transaction latency of XRPL are central to its adoption by financial institutions. As highlighted in a Financial Times excerpt shared in the tweet, Ripple engineered its technology from the outset to handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. This design goal aligns with the operational requirements of major financial institutions such as Standard Chartered and Bank of America, which necessitate systems that can support large-scale, real-time transaction processing. SMQKE’s tweet argues that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not built for today’s payment environment, and available data supports this claim. XRP, on the other hand, was designed specifically for fast and reliable transactions within regulated frameworks. This distinction explains why banks and regulated financial entities have steered clear of BTC and ETH in operational payment infrastructure, reserving their usage for speculative purposes instead. In summary, technical scalability, regulatory alignment, and settlement efficiency are essential for digital assets to be used in global payments. XRP, through its consensus mechanism and system design, meets the scalability and compliance standards required for institutional adoption, making it a strong candidate for modern payment systems.

Here’s What You Need to Know,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-healthcare-is-building-a-real-world-ecosystem-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"AI-driven health technology company XRP Healthcare has reiterated its mission to transform the global healthcare landscape through innovation rooted in accessibility, decentralization, and practical impact. The company stated , “Healthcare shouldn’t be a luxury — it should be connected, intelligent, and accessible,” emphasizing a core belief that healthcare must not remain a privilege for the few. XRP Healthcare underscored its tangible progress, asserting that it is “building a real-world ecosystem through AI, M&A, and purposeful innovation — not promises.” Building a Healthcare Ecosystem Beyond Promises This message was accompanied by a link to a more detailed article published on Medium, where the company outlined the foundational elements of its ecosystem. The article reiterated that XRP Healthcare is not aiming to become just another entity in the health sector. Instead, it presents itself as a structured and scalable framework for what it describes as “interconnected, decentralized, and compassionate healthcare.” The company is advancing this vision by expanding physical and digital infrastructure in tandem, asserting that each milestone — whether a new clinic, app feature, or wallet update — enhances the overall functionality and purpose of its ecosystem. Ground-Level Impact Through Strategic M&A in Uganda One of the company’s key strategies involves mergers and acquisitions in Uganda, which serve to establish and strengthen healthcare service delivery on the ground. These physical assets form a critical base for its broader, tech-enabled health system. According to the Medium article, the company’s proprietary XRPH AI App offers multilingual, personalized health guidance, providing users with context-sensitive support in real time. XRP Healthcare positions this tool as a step toward greater individual empowerment within the healthcare journey. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Integrating Digital Tools for User-Centered Health Access In addition to the AI-driven application, the XRPH Wallet acts as a digital interface for secure interaction and payments. It is a part of the infrastructure designed to facilitate smoother patient-provider exchanges and improve healthcare access through decentralized technology. Another feature, the Prescription Savings Card, is exclusively accessible through the XRPH AI App. This card links users to a network of over 68,000 pharmacies in the United States, offering potential financial relief and increased affordability for prescription medications. Upcoming TSX Venture Listing and Global Investment Outlook The company also referenced its forthcoming listing on the TSX Venture Exchange . This move is described as an effort to open its platform to global investors and allow public capital to support what it characterizes as a long-term vision for health equity and prosperity. XRP Healthcare stated that it represents a new class of health company, one that merges financial performance with societal benefit through responsible acquisition strategies, AI-driven tools, and decentralized finance. By pairing traditional business models with emerging technologies, XRP Healthcare continues to position itself as an active agent in reshaping healthcare delivery and accessibility.

Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While momentum has cooled, the broader structure remains intact. The price action is showing signs of potential accumulation at support, and traders are watching closely to see if this pullback turns into a deeper correction or a fresh leg up. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC is currently holding above the $103K region after sweeping the $101K sell-side liquidity. The previous bullish structure is still valid, and the price is likely targeting the mid-range of the ascending channel. The 100-day (orange) and 200-day (blue) moving averages are not far below, sitting at $92K and $95K, respectively, and continue to slope upward. This indicates that the long-term bullish momentum is not yet broken. The RSI on the daily is recovering slightly from below 50, suggesting neutral momentum after days of cooling off. Until the asset breaks below the $100K–$101K range, the current drop looks like a healthy correction in an uptrend. However, failure to reclaim the $106K–$108K resistance area quickly could increase the probability of revisiting the $95K–$97K order block, and even the two moving averages. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, BTC wicked below the descending wedge pattern after finding strong demand near the $100K area and began a V-shaped recovery. This structure historically signals a bullish reversal, and the move back above $103K supports this case. However, the current rally is approaching resistance again, which is the higher boundary of the pattern near the $105K mark, and the RSI is still under 50. This level could act as a temporary ceiling unless momentum strengthens. The sharp wick below $100K looks like a textbook liquidity grab, suggesting market makers ran stops before driving the price higher. If the buyers manage to hold above the $100K base and flip the $105K–$106K area, the door reopens for a push toward $108K and possibly a new all-time high above $112K. On the other hand, a failure to do so would likely lead to more range-bound action between $101K and $106K in the coming days. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve The Exchange Reserve chart reveals a persistent and steep decline in the amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges, now reaching a historic low at 2.3 million BTC. This trend has accelerated over the past year and continues into June 2025, despite BTC trading above $100K. In classical supply-demand terms, this represents a significant supply-side squeeze: fewer coins on exchanges mean less liquidity available for instant sale, tightening the circulating supply and amplifying the impact of even moderate demand spikes. This behaviour reflects a strong macroeconomic undercurrent. First, institutional accumulation is likely driving much of this trend. Large entities often move coins off exchanges into custody solutions when positioning for long-term holding or to reduce counterparty risk. Second, the growing presence of spot Bitcoin ETFs and custodial platforms (like Fidelity or BlackRock) means that BTC is increasingly flowing into vehicles that don’t recycle it back onto exchanges, removing it from the liquid supply indefinitely. This dynamic creates structural illiquidity that underpins Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside.

Now, some digital currencies are emerging as potential leaders. Analysts predict that five cryptocurrencies might deliver higher growth by 2025 than major tech companies. This shift raises questions about which digital assets could offer these impressive returns and what factors position them for such success.

The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin’s Journey: Is the Original Cryptocurrency Still King? Bitcoin, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first cryptocurrency. It operates without a central authority, allowing people to send money directly to each other. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin uses a shared ledger called blockchain. This ledger is spread across many computers, so no single entity controls it. Transactions are verified by miners, who solve complex puzzles to add new records and are rewarded with bitcoins. This process keeps the system secure and prevents fraud. In today’s market, Bitcoin remains a major player among cryptocurrencies. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and events called “halvings,” which reduce miners’ rewards every four years, affect its value and mining. Compared to other coins, Bitcoin is seen as digital gold—a store of value. Recent trends show renewed interest in Bitcoin as people look for alternatives to traditional money. While other cryptocurrencies offer different features, Bitcoin’s established network and early start make it attractive to many. Ethereum’s Leap into the Future: Scalability and Growth Await Ethereum has been a pioneer in the blockchain world since its launch in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, or dApps. With the move to Proof-of-Stake through the Merge in 2022, Ethereum reduced its energy consumption and opened new possibilities for efficiency. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon help speed up transactions and lower costs. The upcoming sharding phase aims to make the network even more scalable and affordable. Ether (ETH), the network’s native token, remains central, used for transactions, rewarding stakers, and as a tradable asset. In the current market cycle, Ethereum’s advancements make it a significant player to watch. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, its shift to Proof-of-Stake and focus on scalability set it apart. Predictions based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles estimate that ETH’s price could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, the yearly low is estimated at $2,700.31, with further growth expected up to 2030. These trends suggest that Ethereum may have considerable potential in the years ahead, especially as it continues to innovate and strengthen its network. Solana’s SOL Coin: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Technology Solana is making waves in the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second without slowing down. This is great news for developers who want to build decentralized apps, known as dapps. Solana supports multiple programming languages, making it easier for more people to create on its platform. At the core of Solana is its native cryptocurrency, SOL. This coin powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who help keep the network running smoothly. Many see bright potential in SOL. Its technology allows it to support a high-capacity network, which is ideal for services that need to handle a lot of users at once. In today’s market, where fast and efficient blockchain solutions are in demand, SOL stands out. Compared to other coins, it offers quicker transaction times and lower fees. With the growing interest in areas like decentralized finance and NFTs, Solana’s capabilities make it a strong contender. For investors and developers looking for the next big thing in crypto, SOL could be an attractive option. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Currency Shaking Up the Crypto World Have you heard of XRP? It’s a digital currency that’s making waves. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was designed to be fast, cheap, and accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional money, it doesn’t rely on banks or central authorities. Transactions are quick, secure, and can’t be reversed. With an initial supply of 100 billion, most of which was given to Ripple (formerly OpenCoin Inc.), XRP aims to make transferring money as easy as sending a text. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and low costs. While some cryptocurrencies struggle with slow transfers and high fees, XRP offers a sleek alternative. It allows smooth payments across different currencies, making it valuable in our global economy. Ripple’s efforts to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem could enhance XRP’s potential even more. Compared to other coins, XRP’s focus on real-world use makes it an attractive option. As the crypto world evolves, currencies like XRP that solve practical problems might lead the way. Conclusion BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP are strong options, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher with its sports-meme blend, targeting 20,000% growth and engaging a passionate community.

This marks one of the most significant efforts to incorporate XRP into corporate treasury strategies. The reported figures, while still proposed and subject to execution, reflect a substantial level of interest in XRP as a treasury reserve asset across diverse sectors. Webus International Files to Deploy $300 Million in XRP Webus International has filed documentation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating its intention to establish a $300 million XRP treasury reserve . The company, which operates in the global payments sector, has expressed interest in leveraging XRP to support cross-border payment solutions and improve financial infrastructure. According to Webus’ public statements, the allocation would be integrated into its broader strategy to enhance liquidity and payment efficiency. VivoPower Raises Capital for XRP Treasury Backed by Saudi Investor VivoPower, a sustainable energy company listed on Nasdaq, has raised $121 million to fund its XRP treasury strategy. This capital came through the sale of 20 million ordinary shares at $6.05 per share. Saudi royal Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud reportedly led the fundraising round The company intends to establish an XRP-based treasury reserve as part of a broader effort to become a pioneer in digital asset treasury adoption within the clean energy industry. With operations in solar power, electric vehicles, and battery technology, VivoPower’s strategic move toward XRP is positioned as part of its long-term innovation strategy. Executives have stated that the firm views digital assets as complementary to its sustainability mission and financial optimization goals. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Wellgistics Plans $50 Million XRP Reserve for Payment Integration Wellgistics, a U.S.-based pharmaceutical distribution company, announced a proposed XRP treasury of $50 million . The firm has secured an equity line of credit to finance the initiative. According to earlier disclosures, Wellgistics intends to use XRP not only as a reserve asset but also as a payment rail within its operational network, which spans over 6,000 pharmacies. The company’s objective includes enabling real-time payments and improving cost efficiency in the healthcare supply chain. If implemented, this would represent one of the earliest efforts to integrate a digital asset into payment operations in the pharmaceutical sector at this scale. Growing Interest in XRP Across Industries The proposed XRP treasury allocations suggest a growing institutional interest in the asset beyond its historical use in remittances and on-demand liquidity. An X user known as ChainStories reacted to the report, commenting , “Looks like more companies are hopping on the XRP train. Interesting to see how this strategy pans out for them.” The remark reflects an emerging trend where corporations across finance, energy, and healthcare are examining the utility of XRP in treasury and payments infrastructure. With a combined proposed allocation of $471 million, these moves—if finalized—would constitute one of the largest public commitments to XRP by corporate entities. The long-term effectiveness of these strategies will likely depend on execution, regulatory clarity, and market stability. However, the initiatives mark a noteworthy moment in the broader institutional exploration of blockchain-based treasury management.

Industry insiders and top analysts are now turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising new altcoin trading well below $1 but showing strong fundamentals and viral momentum. MUTM’s support comes from more than 11,700 investors who have contributed $10.1 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see their investment doubled to $0.06 when the token is launched in exchanges. As the hunt intensifies for the best crypto to buy now, MUTM stands out as a high-potential candidate, poised to deliver remarkable returns where others, including ADA, may face slower growth. For investors wondering what crypto to invest in, this emerging DeFi token could be the smartest bet before its anticipated surge. Mutuum Finance into Phase 5 of its Presale The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.1 million total sales and attracted more than 11,700 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders can depend on regular income, while borrowers find safe options when they borrow money. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Resilient USD-Pegged Stablecoin Following Certik Audit Completion Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin’s robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. While Cardano (ADA) has long been a go-to for steady growth, attention is now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto with real potential to hit $1 and beyond. With over 11,700 investors already backing the project and more than $10.1 million raised in its presale, MUTM is currently priced at just $0.03—meaning early buyers could see their investment double when the token launches at $0.06. What sets Mutuum Finance apart is its innovative dual lending system that gives users more control and flexibility, combined with a stable, USD-pegged coin that’s been fully audited for security. For those wondering where to invest next, MUTM offers a promising mix of strong fundamentals and growth potential that many established coins can’t match right now. Getting in early could be a smart move before this project takes off.

Recent price action shows increasing bearish momentum. Buyers have failed to hold critical levels on both the USDT and BTC pairs, suggesting a cautious outlook for the short term. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair XRP/USDT is now trading around $2.2 after getting rejected from the higher boundary of the large descending channel. The price has also lost the 100-day MA (orange) and is testing the 200-day MA (blue), both located around the $2.30 mark. The RSI also sits near 44, reflecting weak bullish momentum and a lack of buying interest. A daily close below the psychological level at $2 would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward the $1.55 demand zone, which also aligns with the lower trendline of the channel. Until the buyers reclaim the moving averages with strong volume, the trend favours the sellers. Structurally, the market remains neutral to bearish, with a potential shift toward bearish if the current consolidation fails to reverse. Investors should watch for a reaction around the $1.90–$2 area, which will likely dictate the next directional impulse. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair is trading around the 2,100 SAT mark after a prolonged grind lower within a descending wedge structure. Once again, the price has lost both the 100-day and 200-day MAs, which have also created a bearish crossover around the 2,500 SAT mark, and is now hovering above the lower channel boundary and the 2,000 SAT demand zone. There is also a notable FVG (Fair Value Gap) in the 1,600 – 1,900 SAT range, which may act as a magnet and a support zone in case the 2,000 SAT level breaks down. Buyers will need to reclaim the moving averages and break above the channel’s higher trendline around the 2,500–2,700 SAT zone to regain any strength, which currently seems unlikely unless Bitcoin itself consolidates. As long as the price remains within the channel, short-term relief bounces are possible, but momentum still favours sellers. The broader implication is continued BTC strength or XRP relative weakness in the market cycle.

45672326,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793231-bitq-exposure-to-bitcoin-with-an-added-layer-of-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1749368110,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/45672326.jpeg,BITQ: Exposure To Bitcoin With An Added Layer Of Risk,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793231-bitq-exposure-to-bitcoin-with-an-added-layer-of-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary BITQ offers exposure to bitcoin-related equities, but introduces additional operational and business risks compared to direct bitcoin investment. The ETF is highly concentrated, with top holdings like MicroStrategy and Coinbase heavily influencing performance and adding company-specific risk. BITQ is volatile, directionally correlates with bitcoin, and has a higher expense ratio than direct bitcoin ETFs, making it less attractive for pure bitcoin exposure. Given these factors, I recommend a HOLD rating on BITQ, suggesting investors consider direct bitcoin funds for simpler, lower-risk exposure. Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is an equity ETF designed to provide investors with exposure to the equity of companies involved in bitcoin. Before investing in this strategy, one must be aware of the additional layer of risks involved in holding a portfolio of companies involved in the bitcoin market. If one is seeking direct exposure to bitcoin, it may be worth considering one of the bitcoin funds as opposed to an equity strategy. BITQ holds roughly 30 individual equities of companies that span from bitcoin miners to banks and asset managers. Overall, the basis for the strategy is to hold a portfolio of ""picks and shovels"" companies building out the core infrastructure for bitcoin, including miners and brokerages. Interestingly enough, Strategy ( MSTR ), formerly known as MicroStrategy, is the portfolio's top holding despite having minimal involvement in the development of the bitcoin ecosystem. Nonetheless, Strategy is a large holder of bitcoin through a leveraged debt & equity issuance strategy for acquiring bitcoin. The target balance for the strategy is to allocate a minimum of 80% of the portfolio to Tier 1 crypto innovator companies whose primary focus is in the crypto market with the remaining 20% in Tier 2, large-cap companies with diversified business interests that include ""one significant public business line focused on the crypto market."" Accordingly, for a company to be classified as a Tier 1 company, 75% of their revenue must derive from servicing cryptocurrency markets. This includes crypto mining firms, crypto mining equipment suppliers, crypto financial services companies, and other financial institutions servicing primarily crypto-related clientele. Companies can also be classified as Tier 1 organizations if 75% of net assets are direct holdings of bitcoin, Ethereum, or other related cryptocurrencies, resulting in Strategy being classified as a Tier 1 Crypto Innovator. Corporate Reports With BITQ holding 30 companies, company concentration will be greater than when compared to larger, more diverse portfolio strategies. Accordingly, the top 10 holdings account for 60.35% of the total portfolio weight. This may mean that the direction of the portfolio strategy can be determined primarily by the top 10 holdings, which include bitcoin miners and a brokerage platform. Corporate Reports Strategy is by far the most heavily weighted company in the strategy, accounting for 11.97% of the portfolio. Though my most recent research covering MSTR is quite dated , I believe the overview can be helpful in assessing the company. MSTR has a unique investment proposition in which the organization issues debt and equity to buy bitcoin in a flywheel fashion. The organization sells this strategy as a leveraged bitcoin fund. The other side of the business consists of legacy operations relating to its business intelligence platform, which many investors in MSTR downplay as the organization transforms into a bitcoin strategy. Given the weight of MSTR in the portfolio, I recommend potential investors research this company prior to making an investment decision in BITQ. The second-largest holding in BITQ is Coinbase Global ( COIN ), a cryptocurrency brokerage platform, at 9.45% of the portfolio weighting. Many of the names following are mining organizations, with MARA Holdings ( MARA ) being by far the largest miner in the cohort. Though my research covering MARA is also dated, I believe understanding the company's structure can help investors determine whether BITQ is an appropriate investment strategy. In short, MARA is a cryptocurrency mining company that began diversifying its business strategy last year into data center infrastructure, including submerged server cooling units. Though the mining industry is power-intensive, the strategy has shifted in the last few years from strictly mining to offloading heat generated from the servers as a form of energy production. Overall, the industry is relatively volatile, with profitability remaining relatively challenged. Given the volatile nature of bitcoin and reporting requirements, financial analysis of the industry can be relatively challenging and may not appropriately represent the industry. FinChat Additionally, given the volatility of bitcoin, fund performance can drastically vary from period to period, showing large gains or losses at any given time. Corporate Reports Year-to-date, BITQ has outperformed the S&P 500 ( SPX ) despite the drastically larger drawdown. TradingView As a result of the volatility in the bitcoin and related market, this strategy may be best suited for active traders or those willing to undertake major short-term risks. In general, BITQ is directionally correlated with the underlying bitcoin market. Under this notion, investing in BITQ may add an additional layer of operational risk when compared to a direct investment in bitcoin. Given that the equities in the portfolio are businesses and not a commodity, one must consider the business operations in addition to bitcoin performance as an associated risk. This may also include industry risk, political risk, and financial performance. TradingView BITQ has an expense ratio of 80bps, making BITQ relatively more expensive than comparable strategies. Given the relative correlation between related equity ETFs and bitcoin ETFs, it may be worth considering investing in bitcoin ETFs given the relative performance, lower fees, and comparable performance.

Currently trading at $105,597 with a daily volume of over $35 billion, BTC has pulled back slightly after its latest golden cross. This setup occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day average, typically viewed as the start of a long-term uptrend. Chain Mind, a widely followed crypto analyst, notes that this pullback isn’t unusual. In fact, it mirrors what happened in late 2024. Back then, Bitcoin dropped 10% right after the golden cross , only to surge over 60% in the following two months. The recent 8% decline post-cross appears to be following the same script. 3/➫ Back in Q4 2024, $BTC dropped 10% right after the golden cross ❍ Then it reversed hard and rallied over 60% in two months ❍ That pattern is repeating now – $BTC has already dropped 8% post-cross ❍ The similarities are striking — 𝗖𝗛𝗔𝗜𝗡 𝗠𝗜𝗡𝗗 (@0xChainMind) June 5, 2025 He emphasizes patience. While many expect immediate gains from a golden cross, history suggests the pattern often begins with a dip before a broader rally unfolds. According to Chain Mind, the setup remains intact, and the $150,000 target by year-end remains realistic. Bitcoin Holds Key Support Zone What reinforces the bullish bias is Bitcoin’s ability to stay well above its 200-day moving average, which now sits near $94,700. This level acts as critical long-term support. As long as BTC holds above it, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview Chain Mind also highlights a rise in Bitcoin dominance, which has hit a three-year high. Investors are rotating capital out of altcoins and back into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer store of value amid broader market uncertainty. Consider these signs of strength: Bitcoin’s dominance is rising, while altcoins are losing ground. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to hold above $2,500. Altcoins like SOL and ADA have broken key support levels. Long-term holders continue to sit on their BTC instead of selling. This points to sustained institutional interest. Firms like Metaplanet and Strategy have been buying large amounts of Bitcoin, while spot ETFs continue to see inflows, despite price volatility. Institutions Favor Bitcoin, Not Altcoins One of the clearest signs that Bitcoin remains in favor is the behavior of large investors, also known as “whales.” On-chain data shows a significant portion of Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in months, reinforcing the idea that long-term holders aren’t shaken. Altcoins, on the other hand, are under pressure. Many are not just lagging BTC, they’re also falling against the U.S. dollar. Chain Mind points out that until sentiment improves and key percentages, such as ETH/BTC or SOL/BTC, begin trending higher, Bitcoin will continue to dominate. To sum it up: The golden cross pattern is historically bullish, even in the face of short-term dips. BTC holding above $94,700 supports the uptrend. Rising dominance and institutional inflows point to a potential surge. For traders and investors alike, this is a classic case of “zooming out.” The short-term noise may rattle nerves, but structurally, the setup for a powerful Bitcoin rally toward $150,000 appears intact.

According to the core devs, they want a hands-off approach to how the Bitcoin network is used, a proposal that has not gone down well with everyone in the community. The proposal is coming amid the ongoing controversy concerning non-monetary use cases. “This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the statement published on the Bitcoin Core website said. In the letter, the developers argued that the Bitcoin network is defined by its users, who are free to choose what software they use and implement the policies they want. The post also highlighted that its core contributors are not in a position to mandate what software or policies they desire. This statement comes amid the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network. “Being free to run any software is the network’s primary safeguard against coercion,” the developers added. Bitcoin community divided after developers’ statement The statement seemed to have gone down well with many Bitcoiners, and like with every update, some people were against it. One of its critics was JAN3 CEO Samson Mow , who had issues with the tone of the letter. “Bitcoin Core devs have been changing the network gradually to enable spam and now seem focused on also removing barriers for spammers. It’s disingenuous to just say “It is what it is now, too bad.” This statement itself is also inappropriate. Feels like an NYA from Core devs,” he said. A statement on Bitcoin Core development and transaction relay policy – https://t.co/K4AaPPqTSD — Bitcoin Core Project (@bitcoincoreorg) June 7, 2025 Mow’s statement comes after a May 8 update in which the core developers decided to remove a long-standing limit on transaction data in a network upgrade to allow for larger data segments. “Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” the announcement read on GitHub. Like with this update, some Bitcoiners still saw an opening to non-financial use cases. Meanwhile, Casa founder Jameson Lopp defended the letter. Lopp mentioned that the core developers are saying that they don’t want to force anyone to run a code they don’t want, highlighting what they think about relay policy and network health. “When there was no cohesive message, and it was just a bunch of independent developers making individual statements, Bitcoin Core was accused of having “poor public relations,” Lopp said. He also added that now that the group has published a joint statement, people are finding a reason to be offended about it. Developers make their case in the joint letter According to the developers, it is better for the BTC node software “to aim to have a realistic idea of what will end up in the next block, rather than attempting to intervene between consenting transaction creators and miners to discourage activity that is largely harmless at a technical level.” They also added that while this view is not shared by all users and developers, they believe that it is in the best interest of Bitcoin and its users, hoping that they agree with their statement. The developers mentioned that the main goals of transaction relay are predicting what Bitcoin transactions will be mined, speeding up block propagation” for the transactions expected to be mined, and helping BTC miners learn about fee-paying transactions. Meanwhile, Bitcoiner Carl Honton has criticized the bill saying, “It’s Bit “Coin” not Bit “Bucket” or Bit “Store” or whatever general purpose data store you have in mind. It’s a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr also criticized what the group aimed to achieve with the relay policy outlined in the statement. “The goals of transaction relay listed are basically all wrong,” Dashjr said. He added that predicting what will be mined is a centralizing goal. Expecting spam to be mined is defeatism. Helping spam propagate is harmful.

Trading at $2.18 as of June 7—up 1.5% in the last 24 hours—XRP’s short-term trajectory remains a focus for investors seeking clarity amid ongoing market volatility. XRP Maintains Resilience Amid Political Turbulence The escalating public feud between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has unsettled the broader cryptocurrency market. The dispute erupted when Musk criticized Trump’s proposed tax and spending bill, which triggered a series of retaliatory public exchanges. The tension intensified further after Musk alleged that Jeffrey Epstein’s case files were being hidden from the public because they implicate Trump. This conflict has introduced a fresh layer of uncertainty into the markets, influencing sentiment and risk appetite across digital assets, including XRP. Yet, XRP has shown notable resilience despite this environment. According to a recent projection from ChatGPT, XRP is expected to climb approximately 5.5% to $2.30 by June 30, 2025. ChatGPT stated, “Given the strengthening fundamentals behind XRP, combined with its current momentum and resilience in the face of broader market disruptions, our projection anticipates a modest rise to $2.30 by the end of this month.” Ripple’s Strategic DeFi Vision Drives Optimism Supporting this forecast are strategic moves that continue to bolster XRP’s ecosystem. Ripple recently announced a partnership with BDACS , a South Korean digital asset custodian. This move is aimed at expanding institutional-grade custody capabilities. The initiative reflects Ripple’s ongoing efforts to position XRP as a foundational asset in enterprise-level blockchain applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple has also introduced a robust roadmap designed to support decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases. Central to this strategy is the integration of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) under the XLS-30 standard, which are expected to enhance liquidity across tokenized assets on the XRP Ledger. These upgrades not only modernize the infrastructure but also offer improved trading mechanisms for institutional participants. Commenting further on XRP’s development trajectory, ChatGPT added, “The XRP Ledger’s evolving infrastructure—particularly the integration of AMMs and its strategic DeFi ambitions—makes XRP one of the few large-cap assets with a clear institutional use case. These innovations, while not immediately priced in, are setting the foundation for sustained growth.” While political tensions may continue to stir short-term price fluctuations, XRP’s core fundamentals and Ripple’s roadmap are steering the asset toward a more stable and utility-focused future. ChatGPT’s projection of a modest rise to $2.30 by June 30 reflects both market confidence and an acknowledgment of XRP’s long-term potential.

The Pi Network's native token, the Pi Coin, has garnered attention as analysts and investors speculate on its potential to reach $1 by 2025, amid a market that is increasingly competitive with new entrants like Codename:Pepe. The Position of Pi Network in the Cryptocurrency Landscape As new cryptocurrencies emerge, established projects like the Pi Network must continuously innovate to maintain investor interest. Pi Coin, in particular, has shown resilience but faces challenges that could hinder its growth. The coin's price fluctuations reflect a mixture of optimism and cautious skepticism from the market. Recently, Pi Network's token has observed notable volatility, with its price moving between $0.57 and $0.76. Analysis of the coin's past performance over different periods shows a 13.15% decrease over the last week but a 10.26% increase over the past month. This fluctuating trend underscores the uncertainty and the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets: With support levels at $0.49 and resistance at $0.88, Pi Coin's future movements will likely depend on broader market trends and its ability to break through these barriers. Emerging Challengers: Codename:Pepe's Market Entry Amid the evolving crypto landscape, Codename:Pepe emerges as a formidable challenger, combining AI-driven technologies with the popular appeal of meme coins. This innovative project aims to capitalize on both trending aspects of the crypto market to carve out its niche. The integration of AI into its framework allows Codename:Pepe to offer unique features such as identifying emerging meme coins, analyzing market sentiment, and optimizing trading strategies. This positions it well in a market that values both technological advancement and community-driven projects. Additionally, Codename:Pepe engages a community-centric approach to its presale events, providing early investors with attractive pricing tiers. Presale Opportunities and Investor Appeal The strategic presale model adopted by Codename:Pepe has been designed to attract early investors with significant incentives, presenting a multi-stage structure where early participants benefit from the lowest prices.

The suit had sought over $1 billion in damages, claiming the delisting favored Coinbase’s cbBTC token. Coinbase reported mixed Q1 earnings, with revenue up but net income down 94%. Coinbase and BiT Global have reached a settlement in their legal dispute over the delisting of BiT Global’s wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) token from the exchange. According to a joint court filing , BiT Global has agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice, preventing future legal action on the matter. Both parties will cover their own legal costs. Details of any further settlement terms were not disclosed. BiT Global Sued Coinbase Over wBTC Delisting in California Court BiT Global filed the suit last year in the Northern District of California, after Coinbase removed wBTC from its platform. The exchange cited “unacceptable risk” that the token could be controlled by Chinese-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who became affiliated with wBTC through a partnership in August 2023. Coinbase raised concerns after Sun’s involvement, questioning BiT Global about his role in the token’s operations. Meanwhile, Sun-backed World Liberty Financial switched its cbBTC holdings in favor of wBTC following his appointment as an advisor. BiT Global argued the delisting was unjustified and damaged both liquidity and market confidence in wBTC, while allegedly giving an edge to Coinbase’s rival product, cbBTC, launched two months prior to the delisting.

Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division—covering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year’s figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs. Coinbase’s earnings were weighed down by unpredictable macroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in digital asset prices. However, the company noted its second-highest ever monthly user count, with CFO Alesia Haas highlighting increased engagement across non-trading services.

Perhaps the most notable reason behind this odd increase is a recent update by the US securities watchdog, which involved XRP and other altcoins. Polymarket Odds Through the Roof As perma-XRP bull John Squire informed recently, the chances for approval of a Ripple ETF by the end of the year had skyrocketed to 98%. Recall that the odds had dropped below 70% just a few weeks prior and recovered to 80% before the surge. As of press time, the percentage has dropped to 88%, which is still a lot higher than the year’s average. When it comes down to a July 31 deadline, though, the odds are down to 17% and continue to get lower as the date approaches, and there are no big developments on the matter aside from SEC application delays . $XRP ETF confidence soars to 98% The market isn’t guessing anymore, it’s anticipating. Liquidity, legitimacy, and momentum are lining up. This is no longer “if”… it’s when. pic.twitter.com/Bi4Z88kLpD — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 7, 2025 The reason why odds on Polymarket are so important for future developments is the platform’s success rate. As reported earlier this year, its accuracy levels have been quite impressive, at around 90%. Here’s Why the Odds Surged Such an impressive pump in the approval odds from around 80% to almost 100% in a single day couldn’t be just a coincidence. In fact, it came after the SEC approved a NASDAQ crypto US settlement price index, which includes XRP, as well as other altcoins like ADA, SOL, and XLM. According to crypto experts, this development is particularly important as it signals that these assets have solid liquidity and reliable pricing, and it removes key obstacles for spot ETF approvals.

Cryptocurrency lost 1% of its value. GRT coin prices target the next support at $0.0893. On June 8, 2025, the Graph price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The altcoin value has corrected below $0.0910 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the currency shed 1% of its value in the day. Despite the upside yesterday, today the market events remained unfavorable for the bulls. The Graph 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of The Graph confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has dropped to $0.0910 over the last 24 hours. In addition, the higher volatility levels suggest a higher chance of reversal. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to heightened volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.1220. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.0827. GRT/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator confirms the recent downturn in price. Its value has decreased to index 40.31 in the day. However, this still suggests that buyers have room for a reversal. If the bearish momentum continues to grow, further instability in the market can be expected. The Graph 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of The Graph coin referred to a weaker bullish trend in the market. Buyers are now aiming for an increase above the current level on the GRT/USD price chart but have not succeeded yet. The Bollinger Bands are converging, resulting in decreasing volatility. This decrease in volatility signifies a lower market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.0954, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.0874, securing the support. GRT/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI indicator is moving sideways within the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has slipped to index 43.33 in the last four hours. The straightening curve on the RSI graph represents a bearish pressure in the market. Further downside is possible pertaining to the bearish progression which can turn the last green candlestick into red.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives out a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.0910 in the past 24 hours. A continuation of the current bearish rally might trap the GRT price within a bearish zone. However, the increasing volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a high chance of a trend reversal, which, if it happens, can lead to a price improvement above $0.0920. Why is GRT down? The decrease in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past few days supported the bulls, as the buying momentum remained substantially high, so the coin is correcting today. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, GRT should rise above $0.5 in 2029. In that year, the price will range between $0.490 and $0.547. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

Since most altcoins are quite sluggish on a daily scale, we will examine in more detail their weekly performances, where TAO and CRO stand in one corner, while HYPE, LEO, ICP, and TRX are in the other. BTC Above $105K The world’s largest cryptocurrency tried to break out at the beginning of the business week from its consolidation range but was stopped at $106,000 and $106,500 on Monday and Tuesday. The following rejections drove it south to the lower boundary, but the bulls went on the offensive once again on Thursday. However, bitcoin was stopped once again at $106,000, but this time, the correction was a lot more violent. Perhaps influenced by the ongoing spat between US President Trump and Tesla CEO Musk, BTC’s price tumbled hard and went to a multi-week low of $100,400 (on Bitstamp). As it came close to a breakdown below the coveted $100,000 level, the situation reversed and bitcoin started to recover some ground. By Friday noon, it had rebounded to around $105,000. Slightly more volatility followed, but BTC was ultimately stopped at $106,000 yesterday and now trades around $500 lower. Its market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Up and Down The weekly scale shows that HYPE has emerged as the top gainer, having surged by almost 9%. As a result, the high-flyer now sits above $35, just less than $5 away from its recent peak. ICP follows suit with an 8% weekly increase, while LEO, TRX, and AAVE are next. On the opposite scale are TAO (-11%), GT (-5.3%), and CRO (-5.2%). SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and SHIB are also about to close the weekly candle in the red. The total crypto market cap has added around $30 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.410 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.
