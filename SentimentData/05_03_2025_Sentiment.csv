However, analysts see signs of a rebound, indicating a potential bullish trend. SHIB is testing a horizontal support level after a decline amid a massive Shibburn of 5000%. Market sentiment suggests a possible upward movement, with a $0.00047 target in focus if buying pressure increases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Holds Strong: Is a $0.00047 Rally Coming? Crypto analyst forecasts a potential rally for Shiba Inu price as technical indicators suggest an upward trend. The price targets are set at $0.000085171, $0.000183312, and $0.000472905, reflecting a bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s dominance declines, SHIB could gain momentum in the market. The analyst highlights a positive technical outlook, signaling strong resistance and support levels for SHIB. If buying pressure increases, the price could reach the projected targets. Shiba Burn Rate Surges Over 5,400%; Whats Next For SHIB? Shiba burn mechanism recorded a sharp rise, with the burn rate soaring 5,440% in the last 24 hours. Data shows that 26,355,678 SHIB tokens were sent to dead wallets, significantly reducing the circulating supply. The latest spike in token burning reflects increased community efforts to enhance scarcity. The process involves sending SHIB to an inaccessible address and permanently removing them from circulation. A higher burn rate often indicates growing network activity, which could impact future price trends. Source: SHIBBURN SHIB Technical Analysis As of the reporting time, the Shiba price hovered at $0.00001310, showing slight gains of 0.08% in the past 24-hours. The Shiba Inu price is consolidating near support, with key resistance levels limiting upward movement. The SHIB reveals strong support at $0.00001, preventing further declines. Resistance remains at $0.00001405, with higher barriers at $0.000016 and $0.000018. If Shiba Inu price prediction breaks past $0.000015, it could push toward $0.000012. A rejection at current levels could send the price back to $0.000012. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish crossover. The signal line remains below the MACD line, but positive momentum could emerge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42, slightly recovering from oversold conditions. Source: TradingView To sum up, the SHIB price shows signs of recovery, with a potential rally targeting $0.00047. Strong support and resistance levels, along with a rising burn rate, could propel SHIB’s value higher, depending on market dynamics and buying momentum.

Imagine doubling your coins and gains instantly with a single move in the current volatile market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) has just thrown down the ultimate power play—a limited 100% bonus offer in Stage 14, turning heads across the market. Meanwhile, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is battling legal challenges, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making waves with a potential 118% rally. With all this action, investors are hunting for the best cryptos for beginners to ride the next wave of profits. Let’s dive into the details. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Bulls Squad Throws a 100% Bonus and a P2E Revolution The Bulls Squad is making history. BTFD Coin has shattered presale records, raising over $6.25 million and selling 71 billion coins. Now, they’re skipping ahead straight to Stage 14, burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13 to tighten supply. To celebrate, they’ve launched the game-changing LAUNCH100 bonus code, doubling every purchase and setting up investors for a staggering 550% ROI. But the hype doesn’t stop there. BTFD’s P2E game, which went live on January 1, 2025, is attracting players eager to earn rewards while having fun. Staking is another game-changer, offering a massive 90% APY, allowing long-term holders to multiply their holdings effortlessly. The referral program is another cherry on top— earn 10% in BTFD tokens when your referral code is used, making every investor part of the expansion. With presale prices currently at $0.00016, and post-launch projections targeting $0.0006, the investment math is simple. A $1,850 buy-in now would turn into $6,937 at launch, excluding staking or referral earnings. And with the LAUNCH100 bonus? You’d be doubling your coins instantly, securing a position in what could be 2025’s top-performing meme coin. How To Get The LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Navigate to the BTFD Presale Connect Your Wallet: Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the Bonus Code: Type LAUNCH100 in all caps, click apply, and confirm the message in your wallet. Enter Purchase Details: Select how many BTFD tokens you want to buy. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. No more hesitations. No second-guessing. The Bulls Squad is rolling, and early investors are already stacking their bags. If you’re searching for the best cryptos for beginners, this is the moment to lock in before the BTFD presale ends. Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Legal Drama Clouds Its Future Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) became a viral sensation in late 2024, riding on TikTok’s meme wave. However, its recent legal troubles have thrown uncertainty into the mix. The original creator of the meme, Phillip Banks, has announced his intent to take legal action over the unauthorized commercial use of his artwork. This has caused market hesitation, leading to a steep drop from its peak of $0.6575 to just $0.03015. While the community still supports CHILLGUY, legal disputes, and volatility make it a risky choice compared to the structured and transparent approach of BTFD Coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Profitability Bounces Back, Eyeing a 118% Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had a rough few months, with a 23% drop in the last 30 days. But things are looking up—SHIB’s profitability has bounced back to 40%, up from a recent low of 18%. Analysts are now predicting a potential 118% surge, fueled by growing adoption and token burn initiatives. With a current price of $0.00001271 and a trading range between $0.00001427 and $0.00001230, SHIB remains a strong player in the meme coin sector. However, for those looking for a fresh opportunity with immediate ROI, BTFD Coin’s presale and bonus incentives offer a more compelling entry point. Final Thoughts: BTFD Coin Stands Out as One of the Best Cryptos For Beginners! Based on market trends and investment logic, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as a top choice for early investors. Unlike CHILLGUY, which faces legal uncertainties, or SHIB, which remains tied to market cycles, BTFD is delivering immediate value through its 100% bonus, high staking rewards, and play-to-earn incentives. The Bulls Squad isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement, and those who join now stand to reap the rewards. The choice is clear. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned investor, the best cryptos for beginners come with the best opportunities. BTFD Coin is offering one of the most exciting presale deals of 2025, and with Stage 14 closing fast, now is the time to make a move. Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best cryptos for beginners? BTFD Coin offers a 100% bonus, staking rewards of 90% APY, and a P2E game, making it a top choice for early investors looking for high returns. How can I claim the BTFD Coin 100% bonus? Use the code LAUNCH100 when buying in the presale to double your coins instantly. Is Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) a good investment? CHILLGUY is facing legal challenges from the creator of its meme, adding uncertainty to its long-term viability. What’s happening with Shiba Inu (SHIB)? SHIB has recovered in profitability and is expected to surge by 118%, but it still remains volatile compared to BTFD’s structured presale model. Why should I invest in a presale like BTFD Coin? Presales allow investors to buy at a lower price, avoid market volatility, and secure higher returns before tokens hit exchanges.

From highs that get your heart racing to unexpected dips that make you second-guess your next move, the market can be unpredictable. But if there’s one thing that has remained clear through it all, it’s the growing interest in digital currencies and blockchain technologies. In fact, analysts have been speculating that the next big breakout might just be on the horizon. A coin that could redefine the game and potentially leave others in the dust. And while some past opportunities, like XRP, might have slipped through the cracks, the good news is—there’s a new crypto star rising fast, and it’s called Qubetics. XRP may have once been hailed as the next big thing, but it’s safe to say that it’s lost a bit of its shine due to regulatory issues and market struggles. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost in the crypto space. Enter Qubetics ($TICS). It’s got everything you’d want in a crypto coin—innovation, a real-world use case, and a presale that’s getting massive attention. More importantly, Qubetics aims to fix problems that other cryptos haven’t been able to touch. With a real-world asset tokenization marketplace, this could become the go-to platform for businesses and professionals across the globe. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy and why you shouldn’t miss out on this golden opportunity. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: XRP Is a Missed Opportunity If you were keeping an eye on XRP a few years ago, you probably remember the hype around it. Back then, it was often touted as the “future of finance” with its lightning-fast transactions and ability to bridge the gap between traditional banking and crypto. However, as time passed, the road ahead for XRP got bumpier. The lawsuit filed by the SEC over whether XRP is a security has caused a huge amount of uncertainty, and even with a recent court victory, the damage to XRP’s reputation has been done. While XRP’s market price still fluctuates, it’s hard to ignore the fact that many of its initial supporters are beginning to look elsewhere for their next big crypto play. Analysts have been making bold predictions about XRP’s future, with many suggesting that its price might never fully recover to the highs it once saw. For those looking for a fresh opportunity in crypto, XRP may no longer be the golden ticket it was once believed to be. XRP’s market struggles have opened the door for other projects to step in and potentially become the next “big thing.” For instance, while the market is crowded with hundreds of altcoins, few stand out like Qubetics. With its real-world application and a presale that has already raised over $14.5 million, it’s not hard to see why analysts are bullish about its future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: Qubetics Is Still Available Okay, so now let’s talk about the hot new contender—Qubetics ($TICS). If you’re wondering what makes this crypto different from the rest, you’re not alone. The thing is, most cryptos today are pretty generic. They promise the moon but rarely deliver real-world value. But Qubetics? Well, it’s bringing something to the table that’s been sorely lacking: a real-world asset tokenization marketplace. The potential of Qubetics is huge, and here’s why. It aims to solve a problem that most other cryptocurrencies can’t touch. The real estate, art, and commodities markets have been held back by outdated systems, and Qubetics is here to change that. By tokenizing real-world assets, businesses and individuals can unlock liquidity and accessibility like never before. Imagine being able to buy fractional shares of real estate, luxury items, or even a piece of artwork—all thanks to blockchain technology. That’s the magic Qubetics is offering. The Presale Frenzy And the presale? It’s on fire. Right now, Qubetics is in its 24th presale stage, having sold over 495 million tokens to more than 22,100 holders, raising more than $14.5 million. Currently, the $TICS token is priced at just $0.0976, but analysts predict it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale. That’s a 155% ROI. Not bad, right? And after the crypto presale ends, some analysts are predicting $TICS could soar to $1, a 923% ROI. But that’s not even the craziest prediction—after the mainnet launch, some experts believe $TICS could hit $10 to $15 per token. That’s a potential 5018% ROI. You’d have to be crazy to pass up this opportunity. If you’re still on the fence, let’s break down a few real-life scenarios where Qubetics will be game-changing. Imagine being a small business owner who needs quick access to cash but doesn’t want to sell off assets. With Qubetics, you could tokenize valuable assets like equipment, real estate, or even intellectual property and sell fractions to raise funds. That’s liquidity in a way that’s never been available before. Another example—think about an art collector who owns rare pieces but doesn’t want to part with them. By tokenizing the artwork, they could sell fractional shares to participants, turning a static asset into something that generates income without losing ownership. The same concept applies to high-end luxury items, collectibles, and even agricultural commodities. The possibilities are endless, and Qubetics is ready to bring these ideas to life. Why Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025 When you look at Qubetics, it’s clear that this is a crypto project built with real-world applications in mind. The traditional crypto market often gets bogged down by speculative trading, but Qubetics is focusing on utility. With its ability to tokenize real-world assets, it could be a game-changer for businesses and individuals alike. Moreover, Qubetics is entering the market at a time when the demand for blockchain-based solutions is only growing. Real-world asset tokenization is one of the most promising trends in the blockchain space, and Qubetics is positioning itself to be a leader in this sector. If you’re looking for a crypto that offers more than just hype and empty promises, Qubetics is the coin you should be watching in 2025. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics XRP might have been a popular crypto coin to buy at one point, but its future remains uncertain. On the other hand, Qubetics is offering something fresh, innovative, and potentially lucrative. With its presale already attracting attention and its focus on real-world applications, Qubetics is a coin that could be poised for massive growth. If you’re ready to take advantage of this opportunity, don’t wait around. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, and the price of $TICS is likely to skyrocket once the mainnet launches. Analysts predict an astronomical ROI, so now’s the time to get in on the ground floor. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers.

Deutsche Bank Expert Analyst Reveals His Forecast,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-there-be-a-rate-cut-this-year-deutsche-bank-expert-analyst-reveals-his-forecast/,"Escalating trade tensions amid new tariffs are forcing financial institutions to reassess their forecasts for the Fed’s monetary policy, with even the most hawkish analysts now conceding a rate cut in 2024 is not out of the question. Deutsche Bank’s economics team, previously the most hawkish on Wall Street on the Fed’s 2024 policy outlook, is facing a challenge to its forecast. While their official position is that the Fed will hold interest rates steady this year, Chief U.S. Economist Matthew Luzzetti acknowledged that the impact of newly imposed tariffs could significantly change that outlook. “You’re definitely starting to see some negative impacts from trade uncertainty in economic data,” Luzzetti said. “If that impact expands and shows up in weak labor market data, the Fed could cut rates this year.” But Deutsche Bank is taking a cautious approach, preferring to monitor the duration and scope of the tariffs' impact before revising its official forecast. Related News: Inside Information Leaks About Friday's Big White House Cryptocurrency Summit - Here are the Latest Information The uncertainty surrounding the trade environment was echoed by New York Fed President John Williams, who said it was important to understand the complex details of tariffs. “There is still a lot of uncertainty about how tariffs will evolve,” Williams said. He also acknowledged that tariffs would inevitably put pressure on inflation, affect market sentiment and potentially hinder economic growth: “Customs duties will have a certain impact on inflation. Customs duties will also affect market sentiment and drag down economic growth.” Despite these concerns, Williams maintained a generally optimistic view of the U.S. economy, citing the strong labor market and a gradual slowdown in inflation. “The US economy is in good shape and the labor market has stabilized. Inflation has gradually slowed,” he said. Williams also expressed confidence in current monetary policy, arguing that it is well positioned to adapt to changing economic conditions. “Monetary policy is in good shape and can be adjusted as needed. I don’t see any need to change interest rate policy at this time,” he concluded. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will There Be A Rate Cut This Year?

Backed by the positive shift in network activities, Cardano is now one of the most promising altcoins in the top 10 with bullish momentum as of writing. Amid the ongoing rebound, Cardano’s price has pared off some of its losses picked up from the volatility this week. Cardano Network Activity Sees Uptick According to data from Santiment , an ADA whale entered the market when its price briefly jumped to $1.13. The crypto analytics platform said this whale activity has been the most significant for three months. These whales represent transactions valued at $100,000 in ADA. Per the accompanying chart, as of March 4, the Cardano network has recorded 1,132 whale transaction counts. The Mean Dollar Invested Age came in at 529.05. In all, the network recorded 2,671 unique $100,000 transactions as the price jumped above $1.13 Alongside this uptick, Santiment noted that the sudden uptick in transactions worth $100,000 sparked a drop in the average age of Cardano now in wallets. This trend has an upside. It implies a jump in the number of ADA tokens in regular circulation. Cardano Price and the $10 Prospect At the time of writing, the ADA price was $0.9369, up 9.82% in the past 24 hours. The coin has traded in a very close range, from a low of $0.7684 to a high of $0.9502. Compared to an earlier ADA price analysis , in which the coin jumped 80%, the market remains cautious. However, the coin has the right fundamentals that might push it to a high of $10. Beyond the retained 35% growth over the past 7 days, Cardano’s open interest has skyrocketed by over 6% in 24 hours. Per Coinglass data, the coin’s futures open interest is 905.62 million ADA, worth over $842.04 million. A sustained boost in this metric might support the quest to breach higher price levels. ADA Price and ETF Catalyst The onchain enhancements spearheaded by Charles Hoskinson, like the push for Cardano to track government spending and the prospect of a Cardano ETF product, also boost ADA price sentiment. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Grayscale’s application for an ADA ETF. This acknowledgment places the coin on the list of altcoins awaiting official feedback from the SEC for approval or disapproval.

The lawsuit, filed in December, alleged Zelle’s parent company and the big banks often left victims of fraud on the instant payments platform to “fend for themselves.” Today, The CFPB told the court that it’s dismissing the action with prejudice, and without an explanation. The move follows the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken the agency by halting most of its operations, including investigations and rule-making. The administration’s stance reflects a broader goal of cutting federal bureaucracy, with Trump labeling the agency as a source of “waste, fraud, and abuse” that has harmed financial institutions. The CFPB’s lawsuit followed an investigation by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who alleged Zelle and the banks routinely fail to adequately protect and reimburse consumers who use the popular network.

Per the South Korean newspaper Maeil Kyungjae , Seoul-based regulators are keeping a close eye on developments in Tokyo before making a decision on crypto spot exchange-traded funds. South Korean Bitcoin ETF Approval Drawing Closer? The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been discussing Bitcoin ETF approval since late last year . However, the body has repeatedly expressed a lukewarm attitude to crypto, and Bitcoin ETFs in particular. The headquarters of the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service. (Source: Financial Supervisory Service/YouTube/Screenshot) The newspaper wrote that Tokyo has also “previously taken a tepid stance on crypto,” but has recently “taken steps” to approve Bitcoin ETFs. As such, South Korean financial authorities have “also begun to respond.” The Financial Supervisory Service, another top South Korean regulator, has reviewed the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA)’s crypto policy and has “shared its findings with relevant organizations” in Seoul, the media outlet reported. Major Japanese media outlets like Nihon Keizai Shimbun (aka Nikkei) has reported that the FSA is considering reclassifying crypto as an investment tool. Nihon Keizai Shimbun added that the FSA is also “considering” granting Bitcoin and altcoin ETF approvals. Mayor of Seoul is hinting at a presidential bid with the slogan ""KOGA"" https://t.co/VvKC5ogprt — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) March 4, 2025 FSA Moving Fast? The South Korean regulators think that the FSA’s silence on this matter lends credibility to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun report. The FSA wants to roll out a raft of crypto-related regulatory changes before the end of June. The Japanese government plan will then likely approve these measures before new legislation rolls out in the second half of 2025 or early 2026. Maeil Kyingjae wrote: “If Japan speeds up the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in this manner, it will be interesting to see how the South Korean government responds.” Lawmakers in the South Korean National Assembly. The FSC, some feel, is acting with caution due to the ongoing power vacuum in Seoul. President Yoon Seok-yeol remains at the center of a drawn-out impeachment case . Japanese stocks have been stuck for about eight months, languishing below its new high hit last July and failing to convincingly break the curse of the ’80s. https://t.co/JkUPonFHhN — The Japan Times (@japantimes) March 3, 2025 Lawmakers Not Focusing on Crypto For Time Being In response, members of the National Assembly have stated that they have paused all work on crypto legislation until the “impeachment crisis” is resolved. This has effectively left the FSC and the Financial Supervisory Service to fend for themselves on crypto-related policy. The Democratic Party – the largest party in the National Assembly – last year pledged to allow citizens the right to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Prior to his election in 2022, Yoon also made a number of crypto-related manifesto pledges. However, his government failed to deliver on many of these.

While Seoul is usually more predisposed to follow Washington’s lead on financial policy, some South Korean regulators were concerned that the US decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 may have been overly bullish. This approach has angered many South Korean financial chiefs , who claim that the FSC is allowing rival nations to steal a march on Seoul. Maeil Kyungjae pointed out that the FSC has recently announced that it would “not approve virtual asset ETFs in the near future, citing Japan’s stance as the main reason.” Kim So-young, the FSC Vice Chairman and the head of the advisory Virtual Asset Committee , said last month: “I have continued to say that I would carefully review [Bitcoin spot ETF approval]. Several countries have not yet approved them. Examples include the United Kingdom and Japan.” The FSA, meanwhile, is also thought to be working on further crypto reforms. These include possible changes to the disclosure laws governing the financial information of crypto firms, and a law requiring all crypto investment advisors to sign up to a national registry.

Two of the funds will enable lending. Canada-based Blockstream announced plans for the funds in January. One fund will underwrite Bitcoin-backed loans. Another will use U.S. dollars as collateral for purchases of cryptocurrency. The third will function like a hedge fund, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unidentified sources. Blockstream’s makes its asset management debut Blockstream confirmed the Bloomberg story on X shortly after it appeared. The funds will go live on April 1, and the firm will begin adding external capital on July 1. Blockstream announced the formation of two of the funds in January. They mark the debut of Blockstream’s asset management division. The company said the funds were made possible by a $210 million investment round led by Fulgur Ventures in October that was intended to accelerate the company’s layer-2 development. Funding from Fulgrum boosted Swiss crypto bank Sygnum into unicorn status. The Blockstream Income Fund will loan U.S. dollars against Bitcoin collateral and focus on loans ranging from $100,000 to $5 million, a sector the company says is underserved, according to the company. Blockstream has a network of Bitcoin-native startups and other businesses are beginning to establish Bitcoin treasuries that will create a pipeline of borrowers. The fund targets yields in the high single digits to low teens. The Blockstream Alpha Fund will combine uncorrelated strategies to provide “consistent, risk-adjusted outperformance within the Bitcoin ecosystem.” The Bitcoin Yield Fund is described on the Blockstream website as “coming soon.” Its post on X implied that all three funds would launch at the same time. The funds are intended for institutions and qualified investors. Blockstream loans will fill a wintry gap The crypto winter of 2022 diminished the liquidity available in the system with the closure of lenders BlockFi, Genesis Global Capital, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius, as well as numerous smaller lenders. The collapse of FTX also shook the entire industry. Today, some centralized and decentralized exchanges offer loans. Credit can be obtained from other decentralized finance apps as well. Blockstream also made a $75 million strategic investment in digital asset services and custody provider Komainu in January. The investment aimed to integrate Blockstream’s Liquid Network asset management platform into Komainu’s off-exchange margining & settlement solution to cut transaction times from hours to minutes. It will also integrate Blockstream’s HSM wallet, among other things. Blockstream was co-founded by its current CEO Adam Back in 2014. Back is a specialist in cryptography and one of the cypherpunks who originated Bitcoin and much-related technology, especially related to privacy and censorship resistance . Back has been identified as Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. He denies that he is Nakamoto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Meet BlockDAG’s Pioneers Chasing $600M—Is It PEPE’s Turn to Break Out?,https://thecoinrise.com/aaves-bearish-outlook-escalates-meet-blockdags-pioneers-chasing-600m-is-it-pepes-turn-to-break-out/,"What is the top crypto to buy in 2025? As traders ponder this crucial question, three distinct cryptocurrencies emerge as top contenders for the upcoming months. AAVE’s bearish outlook is deteriorating further, with its price falling back to $250 and an increasing volume of transactions ending in losses. Meanwhile, after a significant drop last month, Pepe has found stability at a crucial support level, showcasing strong PEPE breakout potential if it holds. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a top crypto presale, bolsters its team with the addition of five new leaders. Combined with impending exchange listings and rapid growth, BlockDAG’s future looks increasingly bright. Analysts are even projecting an impressive 30,000x return for BDAG holders in the forthcoming years as the presale quickly heads towards its $600 million target. AAVE’s Bearish Outlook: Mounting Losses Signal Troubles Over the past year, Aave (AAVE) climbed from $94 to $400 before slipping to $250. However, the short-term view for AAVE bearish outlook grows increasingly gloomy, as many transactions are now ending at a loss. For every dollar of AAVE traded, $0.88 is lost. This trend highlights the growing fear and uncertainty in the market, particularly as major holders start to offload their holdings. This AAVE’s bearish outlook is further exacerbated by dwindling profits for long-term holders, adding to the selling pressure and potentially driving prices lower. Pepe Breakout Potential: Essential Resistance Marks The Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential is gaining traction after a significant downturn. Having plummeted 40% last month and an additional 4% recently, PEPE is now steadying at a crucial support level. If this support remains intact, experts suggest PEPE could rebound, with the breakout aiming towards $0.000016. The next major resistance is at $0.11, and breaking past that could propel PEPE to $0.21, with a further potential rise to $0.41 if the upward trend continues. Whether the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential materializes will also depend on wider market dynamics, particularly the movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlockDAG: Meet the Team Driving 30,000X ROI Potential! BlockDAG has recently welcomed five new experts to its leadership team, each seasoned in their respective fields. Nicolaas David van den Bergh, the new Chief Marketing Officer, boasts over 20 years in media and digital industries, aiming to enhance the network’s global outreach. Marcus Xavier, now Head of Learning, will leverage his instructional design expertise to enhance educational resources. Robert Radek, the new Product Manager, brings over seven years of experience in blockchain and fintech to spearhead innovation across BlockDAG’s offerings. Joshua Sack, a mining and cybersecurity specialist, will enhance the network’s security protocols, while Liza van den Berg will oversee HR and operations with her 13 years of experience in IT recruitment and business development. Together, these new leaders, along with the existing visionary team, aim to scale BlockDAG’s blockchain solutions, driving the network towards its $600 million crypto presale goal. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting a massive 30,000X ROI in the coming years as the network’s ecosystem expands, with its presale already crossed $200.5 million and upcoming exchange listings on the horizon. Currently, with BDAG priced at just $0.0248 in batch 27, it represents the top crypto to buy in 2025. Early participants have already enjoyed a 2380% return, and with a 30,000X ROI forecast in place, this offers the most substantial crypto opportunity today. Identifying the Top Crypto To Buy in 2025! As AAVE’s bearish outlook worsens with rising trade losses and diminishing long-term holder profits, indicating further price declines, the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential remains robust, promising significant gains if current support levels endure. However, for those searching for the top crypto to buy in 2025 , look no further than BlockDAG. It stands out among other altcoins with its historic 30,000x ROI potential. Supported by a talented team and expertise across essential areas, the network is rapidly advancing towards a $600 million goal. Thus, the current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27 presents the best opportunity for maximum returns. However, with Batch 27 nearly sold out, swift action is essential to secure a spot before BlockDAG’s expected rise.

41166854,https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,1741132843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/41166854.jpeg,"Will Litecoin Hit the $500 Mark or Does Web3Bay’s 3,633% Growth Potential Offer More Value?",https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,"Litecoin has recently broken out from its stagnant price range, achieving a noteworthy 30% rise within a fortnight. This surge has ignited discussions among analysts about whether LTC could reach the $500 milestone. Despite its well-established status in the crypto sphere, Litecoin’s path to significant gains is clouded by a competitive landscape that includes newer, more agile blockchains. Concurrently, Web3Bay is drawing considerable interest for its potential to redefine e-commerce through decentralization. Still in its presale phase, Web3Bay has already secured over $1.6 million in funding, with projections pointing to possible gains of up to 3,633% for early investors. This begs the question: is it more pragmatic to bet on Litecoin’s steady climb or to invest in the explosive potential of Web3Bay? Let’s delve deeper to uncover which offers the most promising prospects for 2025. Will Litecoin Achieve a $500 Valuation? The recent rally in Litecoin’s price has rejuvenated investor confidence, propelling LTC past the significant $100 resistance level to a current price of $128. If LTC can breach the $135 mark, it might set its sights on reaching higher resistance levels at $175 and $240, which correspond to key Fibonacci retracement levels, hinting at the possibility of further gains. Another pivotal factor for Litecoin’s potential growth is the prospective approval of a Litecoin ETF in the U.S. The SEC’s acknowledgment of a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing and NASDAQ’s intent to list the ETF shares could usher in substantial institutional investment, driving up demand and prices. However, a surge to $500 would require an increase of nearly 290% from current levels—a feat Litecoin hasn’t managed since 2017. Given the rise of competitors like Solana and Avalanche, maintaining momentum to hit such a high target could prove challenging for Litecoin despite its optimistic short-term trajectory. Web3Bay’s Potential for a 3,633% Return While Litecoin offers a possibility for steady growth, Web3Bay’s promise of a high return on investment positions it as a potentially more lucrative endeavor. Web3Bay is innovating within the e-commerce sector by creating a decentralized platform where transactions bypass intermediaries, thereby reducing fees and enhancing user autonomy. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay aims to establish a more transparent, efficient, and community-focused shopping experience compared to traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay. The strong performance of the Web3Bay presale, which has already raised significant funds, underscores investor confidence. With the token priced at $0.005247 and a target launch price of $0.1959, early investors could achieve an ROI of 3,633% if the project reaches its expected valuation. Distinctive Factors Elevating Web3Bay’s Profile Tangible Benefits: Web3Bay is designed to solve genuine challenges in the e-commerce industry, suggesting a sustainable model for long-term growth. Advantageous Early Entry: The ongoing presale offers an opportunity for investors to acquire tokens at a minimal price before they are listed on major exchanges. Expansive Market Reach: The e-commerce industry, worth over $6 trillion, presents a vast field for Web3Bay to tap into with its decentralized solution, potentially removing costly fees and traditional barriers. Exceptional Growth Prospects: While Litecoin’s price might gradually increase, Web3Bay’s presale stage offers a unique chance for substantial returns in a shorter timeframe. Summing Up! Litecoin’s journey towards $500, though feasible, is fraught with uncertainties stemming from stiff market competition and the dependency on sustained institutional backing. In contrast, Web3Bay stands at a pioneering phase where the potential for extraordinary gains is markedly higher. As it carves a niche in decentralized e-commerce and continues to attract significant presale investments, Web3Bay represents an opportunity that is difficult to overlook. For investors who have previously missed out on early investments in major projects like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable chance to participate at the ground level for potentially transformative returns.

XRP was created to be used with RippleNet, a blockchain-based network designed for banks and financial institutions. With growing adoption and potential replacement of traditional systems like SWIFT, many are asking: Can the XRP price hit $1,000? Can XRP Price Skyrocket if Trump Endorses It as Swift’s Successor? RippleNet provides customers with payments that are both speedier and cost-slower than what SWIFT, the industry norm, has delivered for many years. XRP serves as a bridge currency to enable swift currency exchange without dependent pre-funded accounts, which grants it superior functionality over conventional payment systems. SWIFT and XRP continue to compete actively, which reveals the move towards innovative payment systems. SWIFT operates as an established payment system for over 10,000 banks worldwide through a correspondent bank network, yet it has served the market since its inception many decades ago. RippleNet resolves settlement transactions through blockchain technology while offering almost instant and inexpensive transactions to compete against SWIFT’s control. Ripple has recently introduced XRP as a major international payment solution after the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve endorsed the blockchain network. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch in March 2025 The latest price of XRP has seen notable fluctuations over recent days. As of March 4, 2025, the Ripple price is at $2.4, showing a surge of 1.83%. Most cryptocurrencies are struggling to recover after a day of massive liquidation. The top coin saw a strong rally earlier, reaching a peak of $2.83 before reversing its course, creating potential support and resistance levels that traders are currently eyeing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish trend. The MACD line shows bullish momentum, having recently crossed above the signal line, signaling possible upward price movement. The RSI is positioned at 58.46, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, but its price could experience volatility as it hovers in neutral territory. Looking ahead, the support levels for XRP are seen at $2.20 and $2.00, while resistance is currently set around $2.46 and $2.50. A breakout above the $2.50 level could push the Ripple price prediction towards its next target of $2.80, representing a potential 19% price increase. On the downside, if XRP fails to hold its support, the next level to watch would be $2.00. XRP Price Chart: TradingView To sum up the, XRP price hitting $1,000 is a big stretch given the current market dynamics. While the technology behind XRP offers significant advantages, replacing SWIFT remains a challenge. The endorsement of prominent figures like Trump could boost its profile, but substantial hurdles remain for Ripple to reach such a high price point.

These holdings are worth around $7.18 billion. Some of these wallets had been idle for six to seven years before unexpectedly reactivating in January 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Below Parallel Channel – Is ETH Collapsing To $1,250? Old Wallets Begin Moving Large Amounts The once-idle wallets did not remain quiet for long, crypto sleuth ZachXBT disclosed. More than $109 million in XRP transactions were registered, with cash going to prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Bybit. This unexpected activity has prompted doubts regarding the timing and purpose of the transfers. Some in the cryptocurrency world worry if Larsen lost access to the wallets and only recently regained control. Others suspect that the money changed hands a long time ago, possibly as early as 2013. ZachXBT remarked that it is unclear whether Larsen still has direct control over all of these wallets. XRP: Market Impact And Price Surge The timing of these wallet activations coincided with a key announcement by US President Donald Trump. He outlined ideas for a strategic cryptocurrency reserve that comprises XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. This revelation caused a sharp price uptick in XRP: from $2.23 to a peak of $2.93 and then to $2.60, translating to an 18% increase. Investors and traders paid attention, with some conjecturing that the value increase was connected to the wallet movements. Previous Transfers Add More Questions Larsen’s transactions have made headlines before. Back in September 2020, he transferred approximately 500 million XRP, worth $115 million at the time, to an unidentified address. He later explained that the move was to NYDIG for security purposes. Nonetheless, others in the cryptocurrency field suspected that there could have been other motivations, although there was no substantial proof to corroborate those assertions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Risk Factor Remains High, Crypto Analyst Notes What Comes Next? Discussions have resurfaced in response to recent developments. Is this just ordinary fund management, or is there something bigger going on? The answers are still unknown. As the XRP community monitors these wallets, speculation persists. Will there be other significant transfers? Could this have a further impact on the XRP market price? While no one can say for sure, one thing is certain: when billions of XRP start moving, people will know and start to make some noise.

Forty-nine crypto wallets belonging to Parsarad were sanctioned as well. Nemesis itself was shut down last year. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions on Parsrad and his wallets on allegations that Nemesis sold almost $30 million in illicit drugs between 2021 and 2024. The site had 30,000 active users and 1,000 vendors. OFAC sanctioned 49 crypto addresses along with Parsarad Nemesis also provided such services as professional hacking services and the sale of false identification documents. Parsarad used the site to launder cryptocurrency for its users. Parsarad, an Iranian citizen living in Teheran, collected fees from users that OFAC estimated amounted to millions of dollars during its operation from 2021 to 2024. He was the sole administrator of the site. “Parsarad sought to build — and continues to try to re-establish — a safe haven to facilitate the production, sale, and shipment of illegal narcotics like fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,” Acting Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said. Chainalysis said the 44 Bitcoin wallets designated by OFAC on March 4 received more than $850,000 between July 2022 and March 2024 and sent more than $1.6 million from them, apparently taking advantage of the recent Bitcoin price surge. Parsarad also had five Monero wallets. Nemesis was shut down in March 2024 when U.S., German and Lithuanian law enforcement seized its servers. Parsarad kept a low profile in Iran, since drug offenses there carry punishments up to the death penalty. According to OFAC, Parsarad was discussing the revival of Nemesis’ services with vendors who had been active on it. Other darknet marketplaces have been sanctioned OFAC said in its announcement that this was the latest of several actions to combat drug trafficking on the darknet. It sanctioned Hydra Market in April 2022 and Genesis Market in April 2023. Authorities also targeted Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato, which laundered $700 million in crypto for Hydra users. Genesis also used a third-party payment processor. Bitzlato founder and majority owner Anatoly Legkodymov pleaded guilty in the United States to operating a money transmitting business in December 2023. The first darknet marketplace was Silk Road, established in 2011 by Ross Ulbricht and closed down in 2013. The U.S. government seized 174,000 BTC in that case and still holds them. Ulbricht received two life sentences in prison in that case, but U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned him this year.

President Donald Trump is set to headline the event. The summit, which will run from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM, will be a roundtable discussion featuring key figures like CEOs, investors, and members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets (PWG). According to Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, the guest list will be smaller than initially expected, with approximately 20-25 attendees. Among the confirmed participants are industry leaders such as MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is also expected to attend. The group will engage in conversations with policymakers, including PWG members like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Attorney General Pam Bondi, SEC Chair, and CFTC Chair. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1897074177380901144 The Crypto Summit aims to foster collaboration between the government and the digital assets industry to discuss and shape future policies. This meeting will serve as the first of a series of events designed to replace the previously proposed “crypto advisory council.” Although official invitations were just sent out recently, the event is already generating significant interest. For those not included in the roundtable, a larger, invite-only reception will be held across the street from the White House, allowing the wider crypto community to participate in the discussions. The gathering has sparked intrigue, especially given the involvement of prominent figures in both the government and the crypto industry. While the exact details are still being finalized, it is clear that the White House is aiming to play a major role in shaping the future of digital assets in the United States.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 00:43:46

33767162,[object Object],1741136424,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Traders Hit By Extreme Fear Again As Price Crashes To $82,000",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-extreme-fear-again-as-price-crashes-82000/,"Data shows the Bitcoin trader sentiment has plunged back into the extreme fear zone as the asset’s price has erased its recent gains. Bitcoin Has Already Retraced The Crypto Reserve Hype Rally Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market kicked off this new week on a very positive note as prices across the sector marked a sharp improvement following the Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement from US President Donald Trump. It would appear that this optimism couldn’t last, however, as the various assets have already witnessed a retracement. Below is a chart showcasing the rollercoaster that Bitcoin has gone through recently. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin touched the $95,000 mark at the height of the surge, but it has since plunged all the way down to $82,600. This means that not only has the number one cryptocurrency erased all its gains from the Crypto Reserve rally, it has, in fact, gone even lower than where it started. Over the last 24 hours, BTC has printed losses of around 11%. The altcoins have performed even worse on average, with Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) sitting at 13% and 14% in the red, respectively. Given all this volatility, it’s to be expected that the investor sentiment would have observed a drastic shift. Indeed, the trend in the Fear & Greed Index would confirm this. Fear & Greed Index Has Returned To Extreme Fear The “ Fear & Greed Index ” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the sentiment that the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets is holding right now. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for representing the market mentality. Values higher than 53 correlate to a sentiment of greed, while those under 47 suggest the dominance of fear. The index being in between these thresholds implies a net-neutral mentality. There are also two special zones called extreme greed (occurring above 75) and extreme fear (below 25). The market appears to be in the latter of these regions right now, as the latest value of the Fear & Greed Index displays. The indicator is currently at a value of 15, but just yesterday, it was at a much higher level of 33. Here is a chart that shows how the index has changed recently: As is apparent from the graph, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index fell to a low of 10 at the end of February, but optimism among investors returned as the Trump announcement came. Now, the crash has once again wiped out hope among the traders. The return to extreme fear may not be so bad for BTC and the others, however, as this zone is where their prices have historically bottomed out. It only remains to be seen, though, how much worse sentiment would have to get before a low is hit this time around.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Crash|Bitcoin Extreme Fear|Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index|bitcoin price|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-05 01:00:24

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 129,500 followers on the social media platform X that crypto whales snapped up about $2.16 billion worth of the payments altcoin XRP in just one day. “Whales bought nearly one billion XRP in [24 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.41. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Cardano, the trader unveils that deep-pocketed investors accumulated over $345 million worth of ADA over the same time period. “The largest whales on the Cardano ADA network have bought 420 million ADA in [24 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X All in all, crypto whales pocketed $2.51 billion worth of XRP and ADA in just a day. At time of writing, ADA is trading for $0.86. Turning to the charts, Martinez warns that XRP appears to be flashing a head-and-shoulders pattern, a bearish reversal structure that may indicate the uptrend is over once the asset moves below the pattern’s neckline. “XRP could invalidate this head-and-shoulders pattern with a daily close above $3, potentially paving the way for a rally to $5!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will plummet to $1.20 if it breaches the pattern’s neckline at $2. As for Cardano, the crypto strategist says he sees ADA igniting rallies if it takes out a key resistance area. “Cardano ADA could be poised for a rally to $2.20! Watch for a 12-hour candlestick close above $1.19 to confirm the bullish breakout.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
