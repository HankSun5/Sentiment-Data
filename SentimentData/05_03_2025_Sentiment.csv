However, analysts see signs of a rebound, indicating a potential bullish trend. SHIB is testing a horizontal support level after a decline amid a massive Shibburn of 5000%. Market sentiment suggests a possible upward movement, with a $0.00047 target in focus if buying pressure increases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Holds Strong: Is a $0.00047 Rally Coming? Crypto analyst forecasts a potential rally for Shiba Inu price as technical indicators suggest an upward trend. The price targets are set at $0.000085171, $0.000183312, and $0.000472905, reflecting a bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s dominance declines, SHIB could gain momentum in the market. The analyst highlights a positive technical outlook, signaling strong resistance and support levels for SHIB. If buying pressure increases, the price could reach the projected targets. Shiba Burn Rate Surges Over 5,400%; Whats Next For SHIB? Shiba burn mechanism recorded a sharp rise, with the burn rate soaring 5,440% in the last 24 hours. Data shows that 26,355,678 SHIB tokens were sent to dead wallets, significantly reducing the circulating supply. The latest spike in token burning reflects increased community efforts to enhance scarcity. The process involves sending SHIB to an inaccessible address and permanently removing them from circulation. A higher burn rate often indicates growing network activity, which could impact future price trends. Source: SHIBBURN SHIB Technical Analysis As of the reporting time, the Shiba price hovered at $0.00001310, showing slight gains of 0.08% in the past 24-hours. The Shiba Inu price is consolidating near support, with key resistance levels limiting upward movement. The SHIB reveals strong support at $0.00001, preventing further declines. Resistance remains at $0.00001405, with higher barriers at $0.000016 and $0.000018. If Shiba Inu price prediction breaks past $0.000015, it could push toward $0.000012. A rejection at current levels could send the price back to $0.000012. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish crossover. The signal line remains below the MACD line, but positive momentum could emerge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42, slightly recovering from oversold conditions. Source: TradingView To sum up, the SHIB price shows signs of recovery, with a potential rally targeting $0.00047. Strong support and resistance levels, along with a rising burn rate, could propel SHIB’s value higher, depending on market dynamics and buying momentum.

Imagine doubling your coins and gains instantly with a single move in the current volatile market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) has just thrown down the ultimate power play—a limited 100% bonus offer in Stage 14, turning heads across the market. Meanwhile, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is battling legal challenges, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making waves with a potential 118% rally. With all this action, investors are hunting for the best cryptos for beginners to ride the next wave of profits. Let’s dive into the details. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Bulls Squad Throws a 100% Bonus and a P2E Revolution The Bulls Squad is making history. BTFD Coin has shattered presale records, raising over $6.25 million and selling 71 billion coins. Now, they’re skipping ahead straight to Stage 14, burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13 to tighten supply. To celebrate, they’ve launched the game-changing LAUNCH100 bonus code, doubling every purchase and setting up investors for a staggering 550% ROI. But the hype doesn’t stop there. BTFD’s P2E game, which went live on January 1, 2025, is attracting players eager to earn rewards while having fun. Staking is another game-changer, offering a massive 90% APY, allowing long-term holders to multiply their holdings effortlessly. The referral program is another cherry on top— earn 10% in BTFD tokens when your referral code is used, making every investor part of the expansion. With presale prices currently at $0.00016, and post-launch projections targeting $0.0006, the investment math is simple. A $1,850 buy-in now would turn into $6,937 at launch, excluding staking or referral earnings. And with the LAUNCH100 bonus? You’d be doubling your coins instantly, securing a position in what could be 2025’s top-performing meme coin. How To Get The LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Navigate to the BTFD Presale Connect Your Wallet: Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the Bonus Code: Type LAUNCH100 in all caps, click apply, and confirm the message in your wallet. Enter Purchase Details: Select how many BTFD tokens you want to buy. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. No more hesitations. No second-guessing. The Bulls Squad is rolling, and early investors are already stacking their bags. If you’re searching for the best cryptos for beginners, this is the moment to lock in before the BTFD presale ends. Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Legal Drama Clouds Its Future Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) became a viral sensation in late 2024, riding on TikTok’s meme wave. However, its recent legal troubles have thrown uncertainty into the mix. The original creator of the meme, Phillip Banks, has announced his intent to take legal action over the unauthorized commercial use of his artwork. This has caused market hesitation, leading to a steep drop from its peak of $0.6575 to just $0.03015. While the community still supports CHILLGUY, legal disputes, and volatility make it a risky choice compared to the structured and transparent approach of BTFD Coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Profitability Bounces Back, Eyeing a 118% Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had a rough few months, with a 23% drop in the last 30 days. But things are looking up—SHIB’s profitability has bounced back to 40%, up from a recent low of 18%. Analysts are now predicting a potential 118% surge, fueled by growing adoption and token burn initiatives. With a current price of $0.00001271 and a trading range between $0.00001427 and $0.00001230, SHIB remains a strong player in the meme coin sector. However, for those looking for a fresh opportunity with immediate ROI, BTFD Coin’s presale and bonus incentives offer a more compelling entry point. Final Thoughts: BTFD Coin Stands Out as One of the Best Cryptos For Beginners! Based on market trends and investment logic, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as a top choice for early investors. Unlike CHILLGUY, which faces legal uncertainties, or SHIB, which remains tied to market cycles, BTFD is delivering immediate value through its 100% bonus, high staking rewards, and play-to-earn incentives. The Bulls Squad isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement, and those who join now stand to reap the rewards. The choice is clear. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned investor, the best cryptos for beginners come with the best opportunities. BTFD Coin is offering one of the most exciting presale deals of 2025, and with Stage 14 closing fast, now is the time to make a move. Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best cryptos for beginners? BTFD Coin offers a 100% bonus, staking rewards of 90% APY, and a P2E game, making it a top choice for early investors looking for high returns. How can I claim the BTFD Coin 100% bonus? Use the code LAUNCH100 when buying in the presale to double your coins instantly. Is Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) a good investment? CHILLGUY is facing legal challenges from the creator of its meme, adding uncertainty to its long-term viability. What’s happening with Shiba Inu (SHIB)? SHIB has recovered in profitability and is expected to surge by 118%, but it still remains volatile compared to BTFD’s structured presale model. Why should I invest in a presale like BTFD Coin? Presales allow investors to buy at a lower price, avoid market volatility, and secure higher returns before tokens hit exchanges.

From highs that get your heart racing to unexpected dips that make you second-guess your next move, the market can be unpredictable. But if there’s one thing that has remained clear through it all, it’s the growing interest in digital currencies and blockchain technologies. In fact, analysts have been speculating that the next big breakout might just be on the horizon. A coin that could redefine the game and potentially leave others in the dust. And while some past opportunities, like XRP, might have slipped through the cracks, the good news is—there’s a new crypto star rising fast, and it’s called Qubetics. XRP may have once been hailed as the next big thing, but it’s safe to say that it’s lost a bit of its shine due to regulatory issues and market struggles. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost in the crypto space. Enter Qubetics ($TICS). It’s got everything you’d want in a crypto coin—innovation, a real-world use case, and a presale that’s getting massive attention. More importantly, Qubetics aims to fix problems that other cryptos haven’t been able to touch. With a real-world asset tokenization marketplace, this could become the go-to platform for businesses and professionals across the globe. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy and why you shouldn’t miss out on this golden opportunity. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: XRP Is a Missed Opportunity If you were keeping an eye on XRP a few years ago, you probably remember the hype around it. Back then, it was often touted as the “future of finance” with its lightning-fast transactions and ability to bridge the gap between traditional banking and crypto. However, as time passed, the road ahead for XRP got bumpier. The lawsuit filed by the SEC over whether XRP is a security has caused a huge amount of uncertainty, and even with a recent court victory, the damage to XRP’s reputation has been done. While XRP’s market price still fluctuates, it’s hard to ignore the fact that many of its initial supporters are beginning to look elsewhere for their next big crypto play. Analysts have been making bold predictions about XRP’s future, with many suggesting that its price might never fully recover to the highs it once saw. For those looking for a fresh opportunity in crypto, XRP may no longer be the golden ticket it was once believed to be. XRP’s market struggles have opened the door for other projects to step in and potentially become the next “big thing.” For instance, while the market is crowded with hundreds of altcoins, few stand out like Qubetics. With its real-world application and a presale that has already raised over $14.5 million, it’s not hard to see why analysts are bullish about its future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: Qubetics Is Still Available Okay, so now let’s talk about the hot new contender—Qubetics ($TICS). If you’re wondering what makes this crypto different from the rest, you’re not alone. The thing is, most cryptos today are pretty generic. They promise the moon but rarely deliver real-world value. But Qubetics? Well, it’s bringing something to the table that’s been sorely lacking: a real-world asset tokenization marketplace. The potential of Qubetics is huge, and here’s why. It aims to solve a problem that most other cryptocurrencies can’t touch. The real estate, art, and commodities markets have been held back by outdated systems, and Qubetics is here to change that. By tokenizing real-world assets, businesses and individuals can unlock liquidity and accessibility like never before. Imagine being able to buy fractional shares of real estate, luxury items, or even a piece of artwork—all thanks to blockchain technology. That’s the magic Qubetics is offering. The Presale Frenzy And the presale? It’s on fire. Right now, Qubetics is in its 24th presale stage, having sold over 495 million tokens to more than 22,100 holders, raising more than $14.5 million. Currently, the $TICS token is priced at just $0.0976, but analysts predict it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale. That’s a 155% ROI. Not bad, right? And after the crypto presale ends, some analysts are predicting $TICS could soar to $1, a 923% ROI. But that’s not even the craziest prediction—after the mainnet launch, some experts believe $TICS could hit $10 to $15 per token. That’s a potential 5018% ROI. You’d have to be crazy to pass up this opportunity. If you’re still on the fence, let’s break down a few real-life scenarios where Qubetics will be game-changing. Imagine being a small business owner who needs quick access to cash but doesn’t want to sell off assets. With Qubetics, you could tokenize valuable assets like equipment, real estate, or even intellectual property and sell fractions to raise funds. That’s liquidity in a way that’s never been available before. Another example—think about an art collector who owns rare pieces but doesn’t want to part with them. By tokenizing the artwork, they could sell fractional shares to participants, turning a static asset into something that generates income without losing ownership. The same concept applies to high-end luxury items, collectibles, and even agricultural commodities. The possibilities are endless, and Qubetics is ready to bring these ideas to life. Why Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025 When you look at Qubetics, it’s clear that this is a crypto project built with real-world applications in mind. The traditional crypto market often gets bogged down by speculative trading, but Qubetics is focusing on utility. With its ability to tokenize real-world assets, it could be a game-changer for businesses and individuals alike. Moreover, Qubetics is entering the market at a time when the demand for blockchain-based solutions is only growing. Real-world asset tokenization is one of the most promising trends in the blockchain space, and Qubetics is positioning itself to be a leader in this sector. If you’re looking for a crypto that offers more than just hype and empty promises, Qubetics is the coin you should be watching in 2025. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics XRP might have been a popular crypto coin to buy at one point, but its future remains uncertain. On the other hand, Qubetics is offering something fresh, innovative, and potentially lucrative. With its presale already attracting attention and its focus on real-world applications, Qubetics is a coin that could be poised for massive growth. If you’re ready to take advantage of this opportunity, don’t wait around. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, and the price of $TICS is likely to skyrocket once the mainnet launches. Analysts predict an astronomical ROI, so now’s the time to get in on the ground floor. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers.

Deutsche Bank Expert Analyst Reveals His Forecast,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-there-be-a-rate-cut-this-year-deutsche-bank-expert-analyst-reveals-his-forecast/,"Escalating trade tensions amid new tariffs are forcing financial institutions to reassess their forecasts for the Fed’s monetary policy, with even the most hawkish analysts now conceding a rate cut in 2024 is not out of the question. Deutsche Bank’s economics team, previously the most hawkish on Wall Street on the Fed’s 2024 policy outlook, is facing a challenge to its forecast. While their official position is that the Fed will hold interest rates steady this year, Chief U.S. Economist Matthew Luzzetti acknowledged that the impact of newly imposed tariffs could significantly change that outlook. “You’re definitely starting to see some negative impacts from trade uncertainty in economic data,” Luzzetti said. “If that impact expands and shows up in weak labor market data, the Fed could cut rates this year.” But Deutsche Bank is taking a cautious approach, preferring to monitor the duration and scope of the tariffs' impact before revising its official forecast. Related News: Inside Information Leaks About Friday's Big White House Cryptocurrency Summit - Here are the Latest Information The uncertainty surrounding the trade environment was echoed by New York Fed President John Williams, who said it was important to understand the complex details of tariffs. “There is still a lot of uncertainty about how tariffs will evolve,” Williams said. He also acknowledged that tariffs would inevitably put pressure on inflation, affect market sentiment and potentially hinder economic growth: “Customs duties will have a certain impact on inflation. Customs duties will also affect market sentiment and drag down economic growth.” Despite these concerns, Williams maintained a generally optimistic view of the U.S. economy, citing the strong labor market and a gradual slowdown in inflation. “The US economy is in good shape and the labor market has stabilized. Inflation has gradually slowed,” he said. Williams also expressed confidence in current monetary policy, arguing that it is well positioned to adapt to changing economic conditions. “Monetary policy is in good shape and can be adjusted as needed. I don’t see any need to change interest rate policy at this time,” he concluded. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will There Be A Rate Cut This Year?

Backed by the positive shift in network activities, Cardano is now one of the most promising altcoins in the top 10 with bullish momentum as of writing. Amid the ongoing rebound, Cardano’s price has pared off some of its losses picked up from the volatility this week. Cardano Network Activity Sees Uptick According to data from Santiment , an ADA whale entered the market when its price briefly jumped to $1.13. The crypto analytics platform said this whale activity has been the most significant for three months. These whales represent transactions valued at $100,000 in ADA. Per the accompanying chart, as of March 4, the Cardano network has recorded 1,132 whale transaction counts. The Mean Dollar Invested Age came in at 529.05. In all, the network recorded 2,671 unique $100,000 transactions as the price jumped above $1.13 Alongside this uptick, Santiment noted that the sudden uptick in transactions worth $100,000 sparked a drop in the average age of Cardano now in wallets. This trend has an upside. It implies a jump in the number of ADA tokens in regular circulation. Cardano Price and the $10 Prospect At the time of writing, the ADA price was $0.9369, up 9.82% in the past 24 hours. The coin has traded in a very close range, from a low of $0.7684 to a high of $0.9502. Compared to an earlier ADA price analysis , in which the coin jumped 80%, the market remains cautious. However, the coin has the right fundamentals that might push it to a high of $10. Beyond the retained 35% growth over the past 7 days, Cardano’s open interest has skyrocketed by over 6% in 24 hours. Per Coinglass data, the coin’s futures open interest is 905.62 million ADA, worth over $842.04 million. A sustained boost in this metric might support the quest to breach higher price levels. ADA Price and ETF Catalyst The onchain enhancements spearheaded by Charles Hoskinson, like the push for Cardano to track government spending and the prospect of a Cardano ETF product, also boost ADA price sentiment. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Grayscale’s application for an ADA ETF. This acknowledgment places the coin on the list of altcoins awaiting official feedback from the SEC for approval or disapproval.

The lawsuit, filed in December, alleged Zelle’s parent company and the big banks often left victims of fraud on the instant payments platform to “fend for themselves.” Today, The CFPB told the court that it’s dismissing the action with prejudice, and without an explanation. The move follows the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken the agency by halting most of its operations, including investigations and rule-making. The administration’s stance reflects a broader goal of cutting federal bureaucracy, with Trump labeling the agency as a source of “waste, fraud, and abuse” that has harmed financial institutions. The CFPB’s lawsuit followed an investigation by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who alleged Zelle and the banks routinely fail to adequately protect and reimburse consumers who use the popular network.

Per the South Korean newspaper Maeil Kyungjae , Seoul-based regulators are keeping a close eye on developments in Tokyo before making a decision on crypto spot exchange-traded funds. South Korean Bitcoin ETF Approval Drawing Closer? The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been discussing Bitcoin ETF approval since late last year . However, the body has repeatedly expressed a lukewarm attitude to crypto, and Bitcoin ETFs in particular. The headquarters of the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service. (Source: Financial Supervisory Service/YouTube/Screenshot) The newspaper wrote that Tokyo has also “previously taken a tepid stance on crypto,” but has recently “taken steps” to approve Bitcoin ETFs. As such, South Korean financial authorities have “also begun to respond.” The Financial Supervisory Service, another top South Korean regulator, has reviewed the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA)’s crypto policy and has “shared its findings with relevant organizations” in Seoul, the media outlet reported. Major Japanese media outlets like Nihon Keizai Shimbun (aka Nikkei) has reported that the FSA is considering reclassifying crypto as an investment tool. Nihon Keizai Shimbun added that the FSA is also “considering” granting Bitcoin and altcoin ETF approvals. Mayor of Seoul is hinting at a presidential bid with the slogan ""KOGA"" https://t.co/VvKC5ogprt — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) March 4, 2025 FSA Moving Fast? The South Korean regulators think that the FSA’s silence on this matter lends credibility to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun report. The FSA wants to roll out a raft of crypto-related regulatory changes before the end of June. The Japanese government plan will then likely approve these measures before new legislation rolls out in the second half of 2025 or early 2026. Maeil Kyingjae wrote: “If Japan speeds up the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in this manner, it will be interesting to see how the South Korean government responds.” Lawmakers in the South Korean National Assembly. The FSC, some feel, is acting with caution due to the ongoing power vacuum in Seoul. President Yoon Seok-yeol remains at the center of a drawn-out impeachment case . Japanese stocks have been stuck for about eight months, languishing below its new high hit last July and failing to convincingly break the curse of the ’80s. https://t.co/JkUPonFHhN — The Japan Times (@japantimes) March 3, 2025 Lawmakers Not Focusing on Crypto For Time Being In response, members of the National Assembly have stated that they have paused all work on crypto legislation until the “impeachment crisis” is resolved. This has effectively left the FSC and the Financial Supervisory Service to fend for themselves on crypto-related policy. The Democratic Party – the largest party in the National Assembly – last year pledged to allow citizens the right to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Prior to his election in 2022, Yoon also made a number of crypto-related manifesto pledges. However, his government failed to deliver on many of these.

While Seoul is usually more predisposed to follow Washington’s lead on financial policy, some South Korean regulators were concerned that the US decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 may have been overly bullish. This approach has angered many South Korean financial chiefs , who claim that the FSC is allowing rival nations to steal a march on Seoul. Maeil Kyungjae pointed out that the FSC has recently announced that it would “not approve virtual asset ETFs in the near future, citing Japan’s stance as the main reason.” Kim So-young, the FSC Vice Chairman and the head of the advisory Virtual Asset Committee , said last month: “I have continued to say that I would carefully review [Bitcoin spot ETF approval]. Several countries have not yet approved them. Examples include the United Kingdom and Japan.” The FSA, meanwhile, is also thought to be working on further crypto reforms. These include possible changes to the disclosure laws governing the financial information of crypto firms, and a law requiring all crypto investment advisors to sign up to a national registry.

Two of the funds will enable lending. Canada-based Blockstream announced plans for the funds in January. One fund will underwrite Bitcoin-backed loans. Another will use U.S. dollars as collateral for purchases of cryptocurrency. The third will function like a hedge fund, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unidentified sources. Blockstream’s makes its asset management debut Blockstream confirmed the Bloomberg story on X shortly after it appeared. The funds will go live on April 1, and the firm will begin adding external capital on July 1. Blockstream announced the formation of two of the funds in January. They mark the debut of Blockstream’s asset management division. The company said the funds were made possible by a $210 million investment round led by Fulgur Ventures in October that was intended to accelerate the company’s layer-2 development. Funding from Fulgrum boosted Swiss crypto bank Sygnum into unicorn status. The Blockstream Income Fund will loan U.S. dollars against Bitcoin collateral and focus on loans ranging from $100,000 to $5 million, a sector the company says is underserved, according to the company. Blockstream has a network of Bitcoin-native startups and other businesses are beginning to establish Bitcoin treasuries that will create a pipeline of borrowers. The fund targets yields in the high single digits to low teens. The Blockstream Alpha Fund will combine uncorrelated strategies to provide “consistent, risk-adjusted outperformance within the Bitcoin ecosystem.” The Bitcoin Yield Fund is described on the Blockstream website as “coming soon.” Its post on X implied that all three funds would launch at the same time. The funds are intended for institutions and qualified investors. Blockstream loans will fill a wintry gap The crypto winter of 2022 diminished the liquidity available in the system with the closure of lenders BlockFi, Genesis Global Capital, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius, as well as numerous smaller lenders. The collapse of FTX also shook the entire industry. Today, some centralized and decentralized exchanges offer loans. Credit can be obtained from other decentralized finance apps as well. Blockstream also made a $75 million strategic investment in digital asset services and custody provider Komainu in January. The investment aimed to integrate Blockstream’s Liquid Network asset management platform into Komainu’s off-exchange margining & settlement solution to cut transaction times from hours to minutes. It will also integrate Blockstream’s HSM wallet, among other things. Blockstream was co-founded by its current CEO Adam Back in 2014. Back is a specialist in cryptography and one of the cypherpunks who originated Bitcoin and much-related technology, especially related to privacy and censorship resistance . Back has been identified as Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. He denies that he is Nakamoto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Meet BlockDAG’s Pioneers Chasing $600M—Is It PEPE’s Turn to Break Out?,https://thecoinrise.com/aaves-bearish-outlook-escalates-meet-blockdags-pioneers-chasing-600m-is-it-pepes-turn-to-break-out/,"What is the top crypto to buy in 2025? As traders ponder this crucial question, three distinct cryptocurrencies emerge as top contenders for the upcoming months. AAVE’s bearish outlook is deteriorating further, with its price falling back to $250 and an increasing volume of transactions ending in losses. Meanwhile, after a significant drop last month, Pepe has found stability at a crucial support level, showcasing strong PEPE breakout potential if it holds. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a top crypto presale, bolsters its team with the addition of five new leaders. Combined with impending exchange listings and rapid growth, BlockDAG’s future looks increasingly bright. Analysts are even projecting an impressive 30,000x return for BDAG holders in the forthcoming years as the presale quickly heads towards its $600 million target. AAVE’s Bearish Outlook: Mounting Losses Signal Troubles Over the past year, Aave (AAVE) climbed from $94 to $400 before slipping to $250. However, the short-term view for AAVE bearish outlook grows increasingly gloomy, as many transactions are now ending at a loss. For every dollar of AAVE traded, $0.88 is lost. This trend highlights the growing fear and uncertainty in the market, particularly as major holders start to offload their holdings. This AAVE’s bearish outlook is further exacerbated by dwindling profits for long-term holders, adding to the selling pressure and potentially driving prices lower. Pepe Breakout Potential: Essential Resistance Marks The Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential is gaining traction after a significant downturn. Having plummeted 40% last month and an additional 4% recently, PEPE is now steadying at a crucial support level. If this support remains intact, experts suggest PEPE could rebound, with the breakout aiming towards $0.000016. The next major resistance is at $0.11, and breaking past that could propel PEPE to $0.21, with a further potential rise to $0.41 if the upward trend continues. Whether the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential materializes will also depend on wider market dynamics, particularly the movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlockDAG: Meet the Team Driving 30,000X ROI Potential! BlockDAG has recently welcomed five new experts to its leadership team, each seasoned in their respective fields. Nicolaas David van den Bergh, the new Chief Marketing Officer, boasts over 20 years in media and digital industries, aiming to enhance the network’s global outreach. Marcus Xavier, now Head of Learning, will leverage his instructional design expertise to enhance educational resources. Robert Radek, the new Product Manager, brings over seven years of experience in blockchain and fintech to spearhead innovation across BlockDAG’s offerings. Joshua Sack, a mining and cybersecurity specialist, will enhance the network’s security protocols, while Liza van den Berg will oversee HR and operations with her 13 years of experience in IT recruitment and business development. Together, these new leaders, along with the existing visionary team, aim to scale BlockDAG’s blockchain solutions, driving the network towards its $600 million crypto presale goal. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting a massive 30,000X ROI in the coming years as the network’s ecosystem expands, with its presale already crossed $200.5 million and upcoming exchange listings on the horizon. Currently, with BDAG priced at just $0.0248 in batch 27, it represents the top crypto to buy in 2025. Early participants have already enjoyed a 2380% return, and with a 30,000X ROI forecast in place, this offers the most substantial crypto opportunity today. Identifying the Top Crypto To Buy in 2025! As AAVE’s bearish outlook worsens with rising trade losses and diminishing long-term holder profits, indicating further price declines, the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential remains robust, promising significant gains if current support levels endure. However, for those searching for the top crypto to buy in 2025 , look no further than BlockDAG. It stands out among other altcoins with its historic 30,000x ROI potential. Supported by a talented team and expertise across essential areas, the network is rapidly advancing towards a $600 million goal. Thus, the current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27 presents the best opportunity for maximum returns. However, with Batch 27 nearly sold out, swift action is essential to secure a spot before BlockDAG’s expected rise.

41166854,https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,1741132843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/41166854.jpeg,"Will Litecoin Hit the $500 Mark or Does Web3Bay’s 3,633% Growth Potential Offer More Value?",https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,"Litecoin has recently broken out from its stagnant price range, achieving a noteworthy 30% rise within a fortnight. This surge has ignited discussions among analysts about whether LTC could reach the $500 milestone. Despite its well-established status in the crypto sphere, Litecoin’s path to significant gains is clouded by a competitive landscape that includes newer, more agile blockchains. Concurrently, Web3Bay is drawing considerable interest for its potential to redefine e-commerce through decentralization. Still in its presale phase, Web3Bay has already secured over $1.6 million in funding, with projections pointing to possible gains of up to 3,633% for early investors. This begs the question: is it more pragmatic to bet on Litecoin’s steady climb or to invest in the explosive potential of Web3Bay? Let’s delve deeper to uncover which offers the most promising prospects for 2025. Will Litecoin Achieve a $500 Valuation? The recent rally in Litecoin’s price has rejuvenated investor confidence, propelling LTC past the significant $100 resistance level to a current price of $128. If LTC can breach the $135 mark, it might set its sights on reaching higher resistance levels at $175 and $240, which correspond to key Fibonacci retracement levels, hinting at the possibility of further gains. Another pivotal factor for Litecoin’s potential growth is the prospective approval of a Litecoin ETF in the U.S. The SEC’s acknowledgment of a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing and NASDAQ’s intent to list the ETF shares could usher in substantial institutional investment, driving up demand and prices. However, a surge to $500 would require an increase of nearly 290% from current levels—a feat Litecoin hasn’t managed since 2017. Given the rise of competitors like Solana and Avalanche, maintaining momentum to hit such a high target could prove challenging for Litecoin despite its optimistic short-term trajectory. Web3Bay’s Potential for a 3,633% Return While Litecoin offers a possibility for steady growth, Web3Bay’s promise of a high return on investment positions it as a potentially more lucrative endeavor. Web3Bay is innovating within the e-commerce sector by creating a decentralized platform where transactions bypass intermediaries, thereby reducing fees and enhancing user autonomy. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay aims to establish a more transparent, efficient, and community-focused shopping experience compared to traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay. The strong performance of the Web3Bay presale, which has already raised significant funds, underscores investor confidence. With the token priced at $0.005247 and a target launch price of $0.1959, early investors could achieve an ROI of 3,633% if the project reaches its expected valuation. Distinctive Factors Elevating Web3Bay’s Profile Tangible Benefits: Web3Bay is designed to solve genuine challenges in the e-commerce industry, suggesting a sustainable model for long-term growth. Advantageous Early Entry: The ongoing presale offers an opportunity for investors to acquire tokens at a minimal price before they are listed on major exchanges. Expansive Market Reach: The e-commerce industry, worth over $6 trillion, presents a vast field for Web3Bay to tap into with its decentralized solution, potentially removing costly fees and traditional barriers. Exceptional Growth Prospects: While Litecoin’s price might gradually increase, Web3Bay’s presale stage offers a unique chance for substantial returns in a shorter timeframe. Summing Up! Litecoin’s journey towards $500, though feasible, is fraught with uncertainties stemming from stiff market competition and the dependency on sustained institutional backing. In contrast, Web3Bay stands at a pioneering phase where the potential for extraordinary gains is markedly higher. As it carves a niche in decentralized e-commerce and continues to attract significant presale investments, Web3Bay represents an opportunity that is difficult to overlook. For investors who have previously missed out on early investments in major projects like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable chance to participate at the ground level for potentially transformative returns.

XRP was created to be used with RippleNet, a blockchain-based network designed for banks and financial institutions. With growing adoption and potential replacement of traditional systems like SWIFT, many are asking: Can the XRP price hit $1,000? Can XRP Price Skyrocket if Trump Endorses It as Swift’s Successor? RippleNet provides customers with payments that are both speedier and cost-slower than what SWIFT, the industry norm, has delivered for many years. XRP serves as a bridge currency to enable swift currency exchange without dependent pre-funded accounts, which grants it superior functionality over conventional payment systems. SWIFT and XRP continue to compete actively, which reveals the move towards innovative payment systems. SWIFT operates as an established payment system for over 10,000 banks worldwide through a correspondent bank network, yet it has served the market since its inception many decades ago. RippleNet resolves settlement transactions through blockchain technology while offering almost instant and inexpensive transactions to compete against SWIFT’s control. Ripple has recently introduced XRP as a major international payment solution after the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve endorsed the blockchain network. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch in March 2025 The latest price of XRP has seen notable fluctuations over recent days. As of March 4, 2025, the Ripple price is at $2.4, showing a surge of 1.83%. Most cryptocurrencies are struggling to recover after a day of massive liquidation. The top coin saw a strong rally earlier, reaching a peak of $2.83 before reversing its course, creating potential support and resistance levels that traders are currently eyeing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish trend. The MACD line shows bullish momentum, having recently crossed above the signal line, signaling possible upward price movement. The RSI is positioned at 58.46, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, but its price could experience volatility as it hovers in neutral territory. Looking ahead, the support levels for XRP are seen at $2.20 and $2.00, while resistance is currently set around $2.46 and $2.50. A breakout above the $2.50 level could push the Ripple price prediction towards its next target of $2.80, representing a potential 19% price increase. On the downside, if XRP fails to hold its support, the next level to watch would be $2.00. XRP Price Chart: TradingView To sum up the, XRP price hitting $1,000 is a big stretch given the current market dynamics. While the technology behind XRP offers significant advantages, replacing SWIFT remains a challenge. The endorsement of prominent figures like Trump could boost its profile, but substantial hurdles remain for Ripple to reach such a high price point.

These holdings are worth around $7.18 billion. Some of these wallets had been idle for six to seven years before unexpectedly reactivating in January 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Below Parallel Channel – Is ETH Collapsing To $1,250? Old Wallets Begin Moving Large Amounts The once-idle wallets did not remain quiet for long, crypto sleuth ZachXBT disclosed. More than $109 million in XRP transactions were registered, with cash going to prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Bybit. This unexpected activity has prompted doubts regarding the timing and purpose of the transfers. Some in the cryptocurrency world worry if Larsen lost access to the wallets and only recently regained control. Others suspect that the money changed hands a long time ago, possibly as early as 2013. ZachXBT remarked that it is unclear whether Larsen still has direct control over all of these wallets. XRP: Market Impact And Price Surge The timing of these wallet activations coincided with a key announcement by US President Donald Trump. He outlined ideas for a strategic cryptocurrency reserve that comprises XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. This revelation caused a sharp price uptick in XRP: from $2.23 to a peak of $2.93 and then to $2.60, translating to an 18% increase. Investors and traders paid attention, with some conjecturing that the value increase was connected to the wallet movements. Previous Transfers Add More Questions Larsen’s transactions have made headlines before. Back in September 2020, he transferred approximately 500 million XRP, worth $115 million at the time, to an unidentified address. He later explained that the move was to NYDIG for security purposes. Nonetheless, others in the cryptocurrency field suspected that there could have been other motivations, although there was no substantial proof to corroborate those assertions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Risk Factor Remains High, Crypto Analyst Notes What Comes Next? Discussions have resurfaced in response to recent developments. Is this just ordinary fund management, or is there something bigger going on? The answers are still unknown. As the XRP community monitors these wallets, speculation persists. Will there be other significant transfers? Could this have a further impact on the XRP market price? While no one can say for sure, one thing is certain: when billions of XRP start moving, people will know and start to make some noise.

Forty-nine crypto wallets belonging to Parsarad were sanctioned as well. Nemesis itself was shut down last year. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions on Parsrad and his wallets on allegations that Nemesis sold almost $30 million in illicit drugs between 2021 and 2024. The site had 30,000 active users and 1,000 vendors. OFAC sanctioned 49 crypto addresses along with Parsarad Nemesis also provided such services as professional hacking services and the sale of false identification documents. Parsarad used the site to launder cryptocurrency for its users. Parsarad, an Iranian citizen living in Teheran, collected fees from users that OFAC estimated amounted to millions of dollars during its operation from 2021 to 2024. He was the sole administrator of the site. “Parsarad sought to build — and continues to try to re-establish — a safe haven to facilitate the production, sale, and shipment of illegal narcotics like fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,” Acting Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said. Chainalysis said the 44 Bitcoin wallets designated by OFAC on March 4 received more than $850,000 between July 2022 and March 2024 and sent more than $1.6 million from them, apparently taking advantage of the recent Bitcoin price surge. Parsarad also had five Monero wallets. Nemesis was shut down in March 2024 when U.S., German and Lithuanian law enforcement seized its servers. Parsarad kept a low profile in Iran, since drug offenses there carry punishments up to the death penalty. According to OFAC, Parsarad was discussing the revival of Nemesis’ services with vendors who had been active on it. Other darknet marketplaces have been sanctioned OFAC said in its announcement that this was the latest of several actions to combat drug trafficking on the darknet. It sanctioned Hydra Market in April 2022 and Genesis Market in April 2023. Authorities also targeted Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato, which laundered $700 million in crypto for Hydra users. Genesis also used a third-party payment processor. Bitzlato founder and majority owner Anatoly Legkodymov pleaded guilty in the United States to operating a money transmitting business in December 2023. The first darknet marketplace was Silk Road, established in 2011 by Ross Ulbricht and closed down in 2013. The U.S. government seized 174,000 BTC in that case and still holds them. Ulbricht received two life sentences in prison in that case, but U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned him this year.

President Donald Trump is set to headline the event. The summit, which will run from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM, will be a roundtable discussion featuring key figures like CEOs, investors, and members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets (PWG). According to Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, the guest list will be smaller than initially expected, with approximately 20-25 attendees. Among the confirmed participants are industry leaders such as MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is also expected to attend.

This meeting will serve as the first of a series of events designed to replace the previously proposed “crypto advisory council.” Although official invitations were just sent out recently, the event is already generating significant interest. For those not included in the roundtable, a larger, invite-only reception will be held across the street from the White House, allowing the wider crypto community to participate in the discussions. The gathering has sparked intrigue, especially given the involvement of prominent figures in both the government and the crypto industry.

Today, the spotlight turns to Web3Bay (3BAY) , a burgeoning project that promises to revolutionize blockchain-powered e-commerce, mirroring the early potential BNB once showed. For savvy investors aiming to capture significant gains from the next breakout token, Web3Bay emerges as a prime candidate for 2025. Already attracting over $1.6 million in its presale, this crypto gem is drawing in investors eager to participate before it catapults into mainstream recognition. BNB’s Rise to Stardom & Web3Bay’s Promising Path Initially, BNB was a modestly priced token designed for transaction fee reductions on the Binance platform. As Binance expanded and innovated, BNB’s value surged, peaking at over $600. Similarly, Web3Bay is carving its niche within the e-commerce sector. Rather than serving merely as a transactional token, 3BAY powers a decentralized marketplace facilitating direct interactions between buyers and sellers—free from intermediaries. Like BNB, which thrived by enhancing its utility across Binance’s growing ecosystem, 3BAY is poised to capitalize as Web3Bay’s platform attracts more users. For those who recognized BNB’s early potential and capitalized on it, Web3Bay offers a fresh opportunity to potentially replicate those successes in the burgeoning e-commerce blockchain space. Web3Bay’s Early Presale Success: A Prelude to Greater Achievements Web3Bay’s presale momentum is a testament to its burgeoning appeal, having swiftly exceeded $1.6 million in investments. This robust early support underscores the market’s recognition of its vast potential. Priced attractively at just $0.005247 during its presale, Web3Bay positions early investors for an exceptional potential return, forecasting a launch price of $0.1959—a prospective return of over 4200%. Adopting a structured 28-stage presale strategy, Web3Bay incentivizes early participation, similar to the successful launches of BNB, Solana, and Polygon. Web3Bay is not merely another digital token; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem poised to transform e-commerce. By eliminating traditional marketplace barriers like excessive fees and centralized data control, Web3Bay hands power back to the users, significantly reducing costs and enhancing transaction security. Why Web3Bay Stands Out Amidst a Sea of Cryptos In today’s saturated crypto market, Web3Bay distinguishes itself with its utility-driven approach within a legitimate business model. As the Web3Bay marketplace scales, the demand for 3BAY is expected to grow, fostering a self-perpetuating cycle of appreciation driven by actual utility and user adoption. While BNB took years to achieve widespread acclaim, Web3Bay is already making significant strides in its initial phase, promising rapid adoption and integration into the e-commerce industry. This not only positions it as a unique investment opportunity but also as a potential leader in the next wave of crypto innovations. Is Web3Bay Poised to Be the Next BNB? Reflecting on BNB’s ascension from a simple utility token to a multi-billion-dollar juggernaut, Web3Bay is charting a similar course in the lucrative e-commerce domain. As its presale approaches completion and early adopters secure their stakes, the window for entering at a ground-floor price is narrowing. Those who discern Web3Bay’s burgeoning potential now could witness substantial gains as it progresses into its next growth phase. The critical question remains: will you join as an early investor in what could be the next big crypto success, or will you sit back and watch another groundbreaking story unfold from the sidelines?

Turning to the layer-1 protocol Cardano, the trader unveils that deep-pocketed investors accumulated over $345 million worth of ADA over the same time period. “The largest whales on the Cardano ADA network have bought 420 million ADA in [24 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X All in all, crypto whales pocketed $2.51 billion worth of XRP and ADA in just a day. At time of writing, ADA is trading for $0.86. Turning to the charts, Martinez warns that XRP appears to be flashing a head-and-shoulders pattern, a bearish reversal structure that may indicate the uptrend is over once the asset moves below the pattern’s neckline. “XRP could invalidate this head-and-shoulders pattern with a daily close above $3, potentially paving the way for a rally to $5!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will plummet to $1.20 if it breaches the pattern’s neckline at $2. As for Cardano, the crypto strategist says he sees ADA igniting rallies if it takes out a key resistance area. “Cardano ADA could be poised for a rally to $2.20!

With countless options out there, finding a project with both excitement and potential is a rare gem. If you missed out on Binance Coin, now is the time to pivot towards Arctic Pablo Coin. A revolutionary meme coin with an adventurous story, Arctic Pablo Coin is rapidly gaining traction, and you don’t want to miss this thrilling ride to financial discovery.

Imagine an explorer named Arctic Pablo embarking on an adventure across icy terrains and uncharted ice-covered islands, uncovering hidden treasures along the way. This isn’t just about a coin—it’s about sharing the thrill of an expedition. Arctic Pablo Coin, or $APC, isn’t merely a digital asset but represents the promise of a magical journey into unknown territories, where every coin signifies both a treasure and an adventure. The presale for Arctic Pablo Coin is currently underway, and there’s a growing sense of urgency—prices are rising steadily, and the current phase could end at any moment. As Arctic Pablo continues his journey, the excitement is building, presenting investors with a unique opportunity to join before the next price increase. The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has already captured significant attention, raising over $1.74 million in its current phase, known as Chillville (Stage 13). The presale price is currently $0.00007 per coin, with the listing price expected to reach $0.008, offering investors a potential ROI of 11,285.71%. What makes this coin unique is its compelling narrative. Each presale phase is tied to different locations and stories, blending the worlds of myths and top crypto coins to create something entirely new. From Atlantis to Chillville, each stage unlocks a new chapter in Pablo’s journey, where the real magic unfolds.

As Pablo pushes further into unexplored realms, the presale prices will only rise, making this your final opportunity to get in at a low entry point. If you’re thinking about making an investment, this is it—the stakes are high, and the rewards even higher. Binance Coin: The Crypto Giant That Revolutionized DeFi Before diving deeper into Arctic Pablo Coin, let’s take a moment to reflect on the success of Binance Coin (BNB). Binance Coin has become a household name in the crypto world. Originally created as a utility token for the Binance exchange, BNB has evolved into much more than just a means of reducing trading fees on Binance. It is now a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem and a key player in the blockchain space. Binance Coin is powered by the Binance Smart Chain, just like Arctic Pablo Coin, but its focus is on scalability and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Binance Coin’s success story is a testament to the immense potential of the Binance Smart Chain, which has gained traction because of its lower fees and faster transaction times compared to Ethereum. As more developers and projects flock to the Binance Smart Chain, BNB continues to play a central role in powering the top crypto coins ecosystem. The performance of Binance Coin over the years has proven that getting in early can lead to significant rewards. However, as with all crypto, timing is everything. If you’re looking for an opportunity that could potentially offer even higher returns, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be your best bet. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as one of the top crypto coins with significant growth potential. The unique narrative-driven approach combined with a deflationary token burn mechanism and enticing staking rewards makes Arctic Pablo Coin an exciting opportunity for investors looking for the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Don’t let this chance slip away—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of an adventure that could lead to great financial rewards! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin, and what makes it unique? Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin with an adventurous narrative, centered around an explorer named Pablo who uncovers hidden treasures. What makes it unique is its presale structure, which is divided into different locations as Pablo’s journey progresses. This keeps the story fresh and exciting for investors. How is Arctic Pablo Coin different from Binance Coin? While both Arctic Pablo Coin and Binance Coin use the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin with a unique presale structure, staking rewards, and a narrative-driven approach, unlike Binance Coin, which primarily focuses on DeFi and reducing transaction fees within the Binance ecosystem. Why should I invest in Arctic Pablo Coin now? If you missed out on Binance Coin’s early success, now is your chance to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin. The current presale phase offers a low entry point, and prices are set to rise as the presale progresses. Additionally, the coin’s deflationary burn mechanism ensures increasing scarcity, which could enhance its value over time. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s staking program work? Arctic Pablo Coin offers an attractive 66% APY staking program. By staking your $APC tokens, you’ll earn rewards as the coin grows. The more you stake, the higher your earnings will be, and all staked coins will be vested for a two-month period from the launch date. What is the token burn mechanism, and how does it affect Arctic Pablo Coin? Arctic Pablo Coin uses a token burn mechanism where unsold coins are permanently removed from circulation during the presale. This deflationary strategy helps increase the coin’s scarcity, which could drive its value higher as the supply decreases. The post Didn’t Get in on Binance Coin?

One day, you’re riding a rocket to the moon; the next, you’re left staring at a chart that looks like a ski slope. Case in point: Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), a meme coin that made a splash when it launched on December 17, 2024, at $0.06 per token. The hype was real, but today? PENGU is trading at just $0.0066—a crushing 89% drop from its debut. Ouch. Now, imagine being one of the early buyers who held on too long, watching their six-cent dream melt like an ice cube in July. That’s the reality of meme coins: timing is everything. And if you’re looking for the next big thing, you might want to shift your focus to a fresh contender— BTFD Coin , which is possibly one of the best new meme coins to join this week. The Pudgy Penguins Price Rollercoaster: A Reality Check Pudgy Penguins wasn’t just another meme coin; it rode the NFT hype train straight into the crypto market. At its all-time high of $0.0692 on launch day, early buyers thought they’d struck gold. But the excitement fizzled fast, especially for those who hesitated to buy the dip before the coin reached its ATH. The token’s market cap sits around $418 million today, with a circulating supply of roughly 62.86 billion tokens. The takeaway? Dips can be awesome opportunities to cash in big, but only if you spot the signs of a meteoric rise early. Luckily, you might still catch BTFD Coin before it surges to insane heights! Why BTFD Coin Is Making Noise (and Raising Millions) BTFD Coin is part of a bigger movement, backed by a growing community and a killer Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.00016, attracting over 11,200 investors and raking in $6.25 million so far. More than 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold, and the numbers keep climbing. But here’s the real kicker: BTFD Coin has an actual ecosystem. With a high-reward staking system and a fully integrated gaming experience, it offers real reasons to hold beyond the memes. What Makes BTFD Coin Stand Out? P2E Gaming Revolution – BTFD Coin’s game isn’t just another pixelated cash grab; it’s designed to be engaging, rewarding, and fully integrated into the token’s ecosystem. Community-Powered Growth – The Bulls Squad, BTFD’s core community, is made up of diamond-hand believers who see the long-term vision. Massive Staking Rewards – With an average APY of 90%, early adopters can compound their holdings while waiting for price appreciation. Deflationary Tokenomics – Strategic burns and a limited supply mean that as demand increases, scarcity kicks in, potentially boosting long-term value. The Numbers: What If You Buy BTFD Coin Now? If you invest $3,000 in BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll secure 18,750,000 tokens. If BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006 upon listing, your holdings would be worth $11,250—a 275% gain. But if it climbs to $0.006 (which isn’t far-fetched given the buzz), you’d be looking at $112,500. That’s a potential 3,650% return on investment. With Stage 14 of the presale wrapping up soon, the price is set to increase in the next phase. Translation? If you wait too long, you’ll be paying more for the same bag. The Verdict: Will You Catch the Next Wave or Watch From the Sidelines? Crypto history is littered with stories of people who hesitated and missed out. Pudgy Penguins had its moment, and while some early investors made money, many were left holding the bag. BTFD Coin, on the other hand, is still in its infancy—with massive upside potential. The window to get in early on one of the best new meme coins to join this week is closing.

Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week? BTFD Coin is gaining momentum due to its high-energy community, successful presale ($6.25M+ raised), and its P2E game that rewards players with BTFD tokens. Analysts predict a potential surge to $0.006, offering a 3650% ROI for early investors. How did Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU coin rise in value after its ICO? Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU started as a niche meme coin but skyrocketed in value due to strong community backing, NFT success, and its rapid expansion into Web3 projects. It saw a multi-fold increase post-ICO, making early investors significant profits. How much could a $3,000 investment in BTFD Coin be worth if it reaches its predicted highs? At the current presale price of $0.00016, $3,000 would buy 18.75 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 at launch, that investment would be worth $11,250. If it moons to $0.006, it could skyrocket to $112,500!

PI Network Posts Profits as CoinMarketCap Listing Nullifies Bearish Headwinds Pi Network, a mobile-minable cryptocurrency, has long faced challenges due to anti-money laundering (AML) concerns and regulatory roadblocks. Trading was largely confined to P2P and OTC markets, limiting its mainstream adoption. However, shifting U.S. regulatory policies under the Trump administration have sparked renewed interest in Pi Network, paving the way for listings on top exchanges like Bitget. PI Network (PI) Listed on CoinMarketCap | March 4 Pi Coin secured a crucial listing on CoinMarketCap on Tuesday, marking a significant milestone for the project. This development has amplified demand and enhanced visibility, attracting new investors to the network. At press time, Pi Coin trades above $1.74 with a $12.1 billion market cap, posting a 3% gain. Notably, PI is the only cryptocurrency among the top 20 to remain in profit amid market-wide liquidations triggered by Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Increased Trader Activity, Nullifies Impact of Market Liquidations Ahead of March 17 Migration Deadline PI Network is currently undergoing a crucial migration process. Last week, the team confirmed in a blog post that March 17 is the final deadline for users to migrate their holdings. Those who fail to comply risk losing access to a significant portion of their PI assets. Crypto Market Liquidations Cross $1 billion on March 4, 2025 | Coinglass With less than two weeks remaining, network activity has surged. Previously inactive traders are now migrating their coins, driving heightened transaction volumes. Supporting this trend, PI’s hourly chart shows consistently elevated trading volumes, even as the broader crypto market experienced over $1 billion derivatives positions liquidated following Trump’s tariff confirmation on Monday, according to Coinglass data. As PI Network navigates this critical transition period, market participants remain watchful of its next major move, particularly with speculation surrounding a Binance listing. PI Coin Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $10 as Market Momentum Shifts PI Coin price is consolidating near $1.78, with early signs of a potential breakout as volatility contracts. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, signaling an impending move, while price action hovers near the mid-band at $1.74. A decisive push above the upper Bollinger Band resistance at $1.90 could fuel a strong rally toward the psychological $2 level, with extended targets aligning with a bullish breakout scenario toward $10 in the long term. The Parabolic SAR indicator has flattened, suggesting a shift in trend dynamics. A confirmed breakout above $1.90 with rising volume could validate bullish momentum, targeting previous swing highs. Meanwhile, the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator shows a battle between buyers and sellers. The green zone signals emerging bullish strength, but the broader downtrend remains unbroken unless bulls maintain support above $1.74. PI Coin Price Forecast On the bearish side, failure to reclaim $1.90 could trigger renewed selling pressure, with downside risks toward $1.58 and $1.54. A drop below these levels would expose PI Coin to further weakness, potentially revisiting lower liquidity zones. However, as long as price stabilizes above key supports and buying pressure builds, bulls may reclaim control and set their sights on higher targets, with $10 remaining a long-term bullish objective.

During the previous week Shibas Inu lost more than 10% of its value as its February market crash exceeded 30%. The cryptocurrency faces imminent danger as two vital support zones exist at $0.000012 and $0.0000094. The experts predict that breaking below $0.000012 in value will send SHIB plummeting 23% to $0.0000094. The current struggles of SHIB cause investors to shift their focus toward projects that merge innovative concepts with practical utility which leads them to inquire about alternative options like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Shiba Inu’s Market Position The recent performance of Shiba Inu directly follows changing conditions across the crypto market. During early February SHIB reached its all-time high of $0.00001964 before dropping to $0.0000123 thus eliminating months of market growth. The Relative Strength Index stands at 45.68 which suggests that the market currently falls outside the ranges of both overbought and oversold. The indicator analysis of Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) maintains a position beneath its signal line which suggests that bearish forces are active in the market. SHIB faces recovery barriers at $0.00001405 because Bitcoin maintains a low correlation of 0.79 with other cryptocurrencies which leaves SHIB without support from market trends. The prospects of achieving a 1000% price increase become elusive because of a lack of catalysts to boost market demand. SHIB’s re-entry into the top-10 market cap requires strong resistance to technical impediments while generating renewed market enthusiasm which seems unlikely due to present risk awareness patterns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gains Momentum During Shiba Inu’s market instability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) charges ahead with its second presale stage which gathers $2 million from new holders that exceed 3,800 users. MUTM is launching its price increase from $0.015 to $0.02 in the following stage while maintaining a current cost of $0.015 which gives all investors a 33% boost. Structured tokenomics outline a $0.06 listing price, locking in a 300% return for current participants. Beyond presale gains, projections suggest MUTM could reach $3.50 post-launch—a 233x surge from today’s price. Presale Demand Intensifies The presale performance of Mutuum Finance derives from its dual-lending mechanism together with built-in purchase motive applications. Users receive interest-bearing mtTokens (for instance mtETH) by depositing their assets including ETH or DAI through Mutuum Finance. These tokens gain value during the time period. Through these tokens the platform supports decentralized borrowing function while suppliers can earn dynamic yields from liquidity pools. The built-in peer-to-peer lending mechanism expands utility by allowing users to trade non-standard assets which include meme coins. The income generated from loan activities allows MUTM to conduct continuous buybacks which distribute the tokens back to staking participants. The continuous demand creation together with anti-abuse features becomes a self-strengthening system. The strategy augments its goal of creating urgency because the presale slots decrease simultaneously with the implementation of a $100,000 giveaway for initial participants. Mutuum Finance gives priority to systemic financial stability instead of hyperactivity which characterizes meme coins. The lending mechanism in Mutuum Finance operates under a loan requirements design that incorporates excess collateral as a safety measure for lenders. Variable interest rates modify according to market assessments to create balance between risks and gains. Security concerns related to newer projects are resolved by conducting third-party audits on smart contracts used by Mutuum Finance. Long-term planning reaches its peak through token allocation methods. Scarcely thirty-five percent (35%) receives diverted funds from supply to offer trading post-launch liquidity benefits. MUTM operates under protection from sudden market fluctuations since funds for partnerships and development and reserves occupy distinct sections of its supply. Shiba Inu faces technical challenges alongside declining momentum in its journey toward achieving higher price appreciation of 1000%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates DeFi technology with strategic project growth to establish itself as an excellent investment option. Early investors who purchase in presale periods achieve immediate profits as well as joining long-term successful ventures featuring robust demand. The upcoming price hike will decrease the available opportunity time. Mutuum Finance’s presale phase 2 offers one of the lowest prices before exchange listings. At $0.015, the token bridges accessibility with exponential potential. Join 3,800 holders and position for gains up to 300% at launch—or beyond.

Solana Realized Profit Registered A Sharp Spike Yesterday According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Realized Profit observed a huge spike for Solana recently. The “Realized Profit” here refers to an indicator that, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total amount of profit that the investors are ‘realizing’ through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold on the blockchain to see what price it was transacted at prior to this. If this previous selling price for any coin was more than the current spot price, then that particular token’s sale is leading to profit realization. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Range The Next Key Resistance, Analytics Firm Says The Realized Profit takes the difference between the two prices to calculate the exact amount of profit involved in the transaction and sums it up for sales across the network. In the context of the current topic, the usual Realized Profit isn’t the metric of interest, but rather a derivative form known as the Realized Profit by Age. This indicator basically tells us about how the SOL profit-taking is distributed among the various coin age bands. An “age band” is a time-range within which coins part of the band were last moved. The 1-week to 1-month age band, for instance, refers to the part of the supply that was last involved in a transfer between one week and one month ago. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Solana Realized Profit by Age over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the aggregated Solana Realized Profit observed a huge spike on Monday following the recovery in the cryptocurrency’s price toward the $180 mark. The sharp rally in the coin came after United States President Donald Trump announced a Crypto Strategic Reserve that is going to include five digital assets, one of which is SOL. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As Bitcoin & Altcoins Bounce Back It would appear the investors were keen to cash in on this opportunity, as the SOL Realized Profit shot up to an hourly value of over $257 million, making the profit-taking event one of the largest in the last couple of months. Interestingly, as the chart displays, 99% of the aggregated profit realization (around $255 million) came from the 1-day to 1-week age band alone. This would suggest that the profit-taking spree was almost entirely due to investors who bought during last week’s dip, capitalizing on their quick gains. SOL Price Solana has crashed following the profit-taking selloff as its price has returned back to $136.

Despite a recent drop from $98,000 to $96,000, many experts maintain that BTC is on course for its next upward move. Last month’s record high of $109,114.88 has fueled speculation that the next milestone will be $116,652, with long-term projections ranging between $150,000 and $200,000. While Bitcoin remains the leading force in the crypto market, those seeking higher returns are turning their attention to budget-friendly altcoins that offer substantial growth potential. Two stand out as top contenders before Bitcoin’s anticipated rally: Web3Bay (3BAY) and Sonic (SONIC). Both remain priced under $1, making them accessible options for investors aiming to optimize their portfolios before the next major market upswing. Bitcoin’s Projected Move: Will It Break Past Six Figures? The recent decline to $96,000 may have unsettled some traders, yet market analysts see this as a routine correction before Bitcoin continues its upward trend. With a previous all-time high of $109,114.88 confirming its bullish outlook, the focus now shifts to whether BTC can surpass $113,000 to $116,000. This expectation is driven by historical market behavior, increased institutional involvement, and the rising demand for Bitcoin ETFs. On-chain data suggests significant whale accumulation, reinforcing the belief that another upward movement is approaching. Some experts anticipate Bitcoin reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 in the coming months, cementing its status as the dominant digital asset. Despite Bitcoin’s potential, its high price limits the ability of smaller investors to capitalize on its growth. As a result, the strongest opportunities lie in lower-market-cap altcoins with significant room for appreciation—making Web3Bay and Sonic particularly compelling options. Web3Bay (3BAY): Positioned for a 3,633% Surge Web3Bay is rapidly gaining traction in the crypto sector due to its decentralized approach to e-commerce. Unlike centralized platforms such as Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay operates on blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries, reducing transaction fees, and granting users greater control over their purchases. This model has driven high demand for its native token, 3BAY, which has already surpassed $1.5 million in presale funding. Investors are drawn to its real-world application within the $6 trillion global e-commerce market, offering an alternative to centralized platforms known for high fees and restrictive policies. Currently, 3BAY is priced at $0.005247, yet its anticipated launch valuation of $0.1959 suggests a potential return of 3,633% for early participants. The presale follows a structured 28-stage system, where each stage raises the token price, meaning that early investors have the most significant opportunity to benefit before 3BAY enters mainstream trading. Web3Bay stands apart due to its combination of practical use and high growth potential. Many altcoins struggle to retain value due to a lack of adoption, but Web3Bay directly addresses a major inefficiency in online commerce, positioning it as a strong candidate for sustained success. Sonic (SONIC): A Low-Cap Altcoin Gaining Market Momentum Sonic is another budget-friendly altcoin drawing increased interest. Built with an emphasis on speed, efficiency, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Sonic offers an alternative to conventional financial systems while delivering rapid transaction speeds. SONIC’s recent 12% price increase has captured investor attention, signaling growing momentum. With a relatively low market capitalization and early-stage adoption, it has ample room for further price appreciation, making it an appealing choice for investors aiming to capitalize on an upcoming altcoin rally. What sets Sonic apart is its extensive utility within the DeFi ecosystem. Its integration into various blockchain projects—including cross-border transactions, yield farming, and decentralized applications—indicates rising demand for SONIC tokens. This increasing adoption is expected to drive further price growth in the months ahead. Why Web3Bay & Sonic Are Worth Considering Before Bitcoin’s Next Move While Bitcoin is likely to achieve new price milestones, altcoins with high growth potential remain the most viable options for maximizing returns. Web3Bay and Sonic offer strong investment potential at low entry points, making them attractive ahead of Bitcoin’s next move toward six figures. Web3Bay’s projected 3,633% return, supported by its expanding presale and blockchain-based e-commerce model, highlights its position as one of the most promising projects of 2025. Meanwhile, Sonic’s role in the growing DeFi market and its increasing adoption provide additional expansion opportunities. By securing positions in these altcoins before Bitcoin’s next rally, investors can position their portfolios for significant gains. With Bitcoin expected to break past $116,000 and potentially reach new highs, now presents an opportunity to consider altcoins poised for substantial price movement.

The summit, led by AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, replaces the now-terminated “crypto council” that Former President Donald Trump once promised. Formal invites started going out Tuesday, with confirmed attendees such as Strategy’s Michael Saylor, Multicoin Capital’s Kyle Samani, and Paradigm’s Matt Huang. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev even teased that he would be there, along with Coinbase and Kraken, who said their CEOs, Brian Armstrong and Arjun Sethi, would attend. The White House summit is expected to serve as a key forum for shaping future crypto regulations. Exclusive Summit limits attendance as White House shifts crypto strategy According to reports , the White House Crypto Summit will have a smaller-than-expected guest list featuring government officials from the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. A larger reception is planned nearby for those not invited to the roundtable. Amid increasing infighting within the industry and overwhelming demand for seats, the Trump administration pivoted to a more permanent crypto council. Instead, the White House will convene crypto summits periodically to meet with leaders. With critical regulatory decisions on the horizon, the event is seen as a sign of things to come for the administration’s approach to digital assets. Saylor pushes Bitcoin strategy as institutions and states boost investments Michael Saylor recently called for the U.S. to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, describing it as the “greatest economic program of the 21st century.” Saylor also said that the U.S.’s ownership of 10–20% of the Bitcoin network could be used to lower the national debt. Despite concerns about the sustainability of the Bitcoin acquisition plan, large financial institutions continue to invest in the company through buying shares or fixed-income securities. According to a Feb. 6 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.6 trillion in management assets, increased its Strategy stake to 5%. BlackRock’s filing came one day after MicroStrategy rebranded to Strategy and adopted a Bitcoin-themed marketing scheme to reflect its core focus. A dozen US states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin, currently hold Strategy stock as part of their pension programs or treasury funds. California’s State Teachers’ Retirement Fund had the largest exposure among the 12 state funds, holding nearly $83 million in Strategy stock. The California Public Employees Retirement System was close behind, which manages state employee pensions and holds approximately $76.7 million in Strategy shares. On Feb. 20, Strategy announced a $2 billion convertible note offering, its latest corporate securities move to fund additional Bitcoin purchases.

Qubetics, Cardano, and Ethereum are in the spotlight, each offering unique value. Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain interoperability, Cardano has staged a remarkable rally, and Ethereum is facing a crucial support test after a steep decline. With crypto presales gaining traction and altcoin season approaching, which projects holds the strongest potential for long-term gains? Qubetics: Solving Blockchain’s Biggest Problem—Interoperability Most blockchain networks today operate in isolation, making cross-chain transactions and seamless data exchange difficult. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralized applications (dApps), financial services, and enterprise blockchain adoption. Qubetics aims to eliminate these barriers by building a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple blockchain ecosystems. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and interoperability, Qubetics aims to become a critical bridge for developers, enterprises, and users navigating the decentralized world. The Qubetics presale is seeing rapid investor demand, surpassing $14.5 million as $TICS trades at $0.0976 in Stage 24. With 495 million tokens already distributed to 22,100+ investors, the project is moving toward its final presale stages. Analysts anticipate $TICS hitting $0.25 before exchange listings, offering a 155.93% ROI for early investors. Those investing $100 at today’s price would receive 1,023.72 tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 post-mainnet launch, that investment would yield an ROI of 10,136.92%, positioning Qubetics as one of the top crypto presales with long-term profit potential. Ethereum: Will ETH Hold the $2,400 Support Level? Ethereum has sharply declined, falling 12.22% over the past week to $2,438.47. Despite its $294.04 billion market cap, the second-largest cryptocurrency has broken key support levels, signaling potential downside risks. With trading volume surging 160.73% to $37.49 billion, sellers have taken control of the market. Ethereum’s downtrend began on February 24, and the price is now hovering just above a crucial $2,400 support zone. If Ethereum fails to hold this level, analysts warn that it could drop to $2,200, creating uncertainty for investors. However, if ETH rebounds from support, it could offer a strong recovery play for those eyeing long-term growth. Cardano: Defying the Market with a Massive 39.93% Rally Cardano (ADA) has outperformed the broader market, surging 39.93% in the past seven days to $1.06. This impressive rally has reignited investor interest, pushing Cardano’s market cap to $37.43 billion and solidifying its position in the top 10 cryptos. ADA’s trading volume exploded by 1,396.90% to $8.79 billion, with technical indicators confirming a strong breakout on March 1. Cardano successfully broke multiple resistance levels, demonstrating bullish momentum with minimal retracement. However, some analysts caution that momentum indicators show overbought conditions, meaning a short-term cooldown could occur before another push higher. If ADA sustains its breakout trend, it could continue rallying toward higher price targets, making it one of the best crypto investments for 2025. Which is the Best crypto investment? Qubetics, Ethereum, and Cardano each present strong investment opportunities, but their appeal depends on an investor’s risk appetite and time horizon. Qubetics stands out as the most explosive opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential, with its crypto presale nearing completion and a possible 10x–15x price surge post-mainnet launch. It is a key player in blockchain interoperability, solving a major industry problem that could drive mass adoption. Cardano’s bullish price action has solidified it as a top-performing altcoin, proving that investor confidence remains strong. Despite its recent pullback, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency, with institutional backing and massive network utility. With 2025 shaping up to be a pivotal year for crypto, these three projects are proving that the biggest opportunities often emerge in times of transformation. Whether investors seek massive gains in Qubetics, stability in Ethereum, or momentum-driven growth in Cardano, each of these cryptos offers a compelling case for being among the best crypto investments of the year. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs How does Qubetics improve blockchain interoperability? Qubetics acts as a Web3-aggregated chain, allowing seamless cross-chain transactions, asset transfers, and data sharing. This eliminates barriers between blockchain networks, making it easier for developers and users to interact across ecosystems. Will Ethereum recover after its recent drop? Ethereum is currently testing the $2,400 support level. If buyers step in, ETH could stage a recovery. However, if sellers maintain control, ETH could decline further to $2,200 before finding stability. Can Cardano’s rally continue? Cardano has broken multiple resistance levels, and if trading volume remains strong, ADA could extend its gains. However, momentum indicators show overbought conditions, meaning a short-term pullback before further upside is possible.

As reported by Business Insider, the motion presented by Senator Ted Cruz, was approved under the Congressional Review Act on Mar. 4, indicating that both parties were against the Biden-era rule. Introduced in December, the IRS DeFi broker rule required DeFi platforms to report user data for tax compliance, thereby broadening the definition of “brokers” to include them. Since decentralized platforms do not hold funds or keep customer data in the same manner as traditional financial institutions, critics claimed the law was impractical. The digital asset think tank Coin Center referred to the proposal as “technologically unfeasible.” “The Biden administration did everything it could to stifle financial innovation in the United States,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said in a statement. “The Senate is working to undo these burdensome regulations one at a time to restore financial freedom for the American people.” The resolution must still pass the House of Representatives in order to be delivered to President Donald Trump for final approval, even after the Senate has approved it. In addition to being prohibited from enforcing the rule, the IRS would also be prohibited from enacting similar policies in the future if the rule were to become law. You might also like: SEC’s crypto task force to hold roundtables on crypto regulations and security status Supporting the repeal, the Blockchain Association, which represents popular cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap Labs, said it will avoid needless limitations on DeFi innovation. According to the DeFi Education Fund, the Senate vote was the “first of many historic milestones in the regulation of digital assets in the United States.” This vote echoes previous attempts to remove Securities and Exchange Commission accounting standards for digital assets and continues a trend of bipartisan crypto-related legislation. The Senate’s ruling might lay the stage for more extensive regulatory reforms, since stablecoin and cryptocurrency market structure legislation is anticipated to be on the legislative agenda. A matching resolution has already been approved by the House Financial Services Committee, and a final floor vote is still pending. According to the White House, President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law as soon as possible.

Vital BTC trading indicators suggest BTC could struggle to hold the recent gains. Bitcoin (BTC) Retakes $87,000 as Market Sell-Off Subsides Bitcoin rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a turbulent 48-hour sell-off triggered by market fears as Trump announced commencement of 25% tariffs on US imports from Canada and Mexico. Investors had withdrawn capital from risk assets following the former president’s announcement on Monday, leading BTC to slump to $82,000, its lowest level in over two weeks. However, as broader market sentiment stabilized, Bitcoin swiftly reclaimed lost ground, surging 9% in the last eight hours to trade at $87,300 at press time. Bitcoin Price Action | BTCUSD 4-hourly Chart, March 5. The BTC/USD 4-hour chart reveals a strong relief rally, with price action bouncing off key support at $82,000 and reclaiming the critical $87,000 resistance level. The rapid move suggests aggressive short covering, as traders who had bet against Bitcoin were forced to unwind positions. However, spot market volumes remain moderate, indicating that fresh bullish momentum has yet to fully materialize. Despite the recovery, BTC price remains vulnerable to renewed selling pressure if macroeconomic fears persist. Failure to hold above $87,000 could see BTC retest support at $83,500, while a decisive breakout above $88,500 would position the market for a potential retest of the psychological $90,000 barrier. The next few sessions will be crucial in determining whether this rebound holds or fades into further volatility. Bitcoin Long positions holders booked 74% of total market liquidations While Bitcoin’s price rebounded 9% to reclaim the $87,000 level, liquidation data suggests that bullish momentum remains fragile. According to Coinglass , Bitcoin long position holders absorbed $370 million in liquidations over the last 24 hours, accounting for 74% of the total $505 million liquidated across the crypto derivatives market. This disproportionate loss among bullish traders signals that the rally may lack strong conviction, increasing the risk of a pullback. Crypto Market Liquidations, March 5 | Source: Coinglass Typically, when long liquidations dominate the market, it indicates that bullish traders were overly leveraged, leading to forced sell-offs that pressure prices lower. The BTCUSD 4-hour chart further supports this, showing a relief rally following a deep sell-off, but with no confirmation of strong buy-side continuation. This suggests that the recent price surge may be driven more by short-covering rather than fresh capital inflows. If Bitcoin fails to consolidate above $87,000, bearish pressure could send prices back toward $83,500 in the coming sessions, with $82,000 as the next major support. However, if bulls can regain control and push BTC above $88,500, the next critical resistance lies at $90,000, a level that could determine Bitcoin’s mid-term trajectory. BTC Price Forecast: Analyst Cole Garner identifies Bitcoin Order Book Depth Pattern Signaling Next Big Move Analyst Cole Garner identified another key Bitcoin price forecast signal alluding to long-term recovery timeline. As seen in the chart he posted on X on Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price action exhibits a strong correlation between deep bid-side liquidity and explosive rallies, as highlighted in previous accumulation phases. The lower panel, tracking order book depth cumulative sum delta, shows a fresh surge in green bid-side liquidity, historically signaling smart money accumulation before breakouts. BTC Price Forecast This pattern has preceded major bullish runs, and if history repeats, Bitcoin could be on the verge of another expansion phase. A sustained bid above $85,000 could trigger a breakout toward $92,000, with an extended rally toward the psychological $100,000 mark if liquidity absorption remains consistent. However, despite the bullish setup, the chart also reveals a historical cyclical reversion. Each liquidity spike was followed by a sharp contraction, marked by red sell-side dominance, triggering corrective retracements. If Bitcoin fails to hold support at $81,500, order book imbalances could shift bearish, opening the door for a pullback to $76,800. A deeper rejection below this level could expose liquidity gaps down to $72,500, risking further capitulation. With Bitcoin hovering at a crucial inflection point, the market’s next move will be dictated by whether bid-side liquidity converts into price expansion or dries up, triggering a reversal. Traders are watching order book dynamics closely, as smart money positioning suggests a major move is imminent. The post Bitcoin Price to $100k or $70K?

Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing bullish momentum, fueled by whale accumulation, but its success still depends on market hype. Avalanche (AVAX) is struggling near key support, with uncertainty looming over its next move. Then there’s Web3Bay (3BAY), a project revolutionizing e-commerce with blockchain—and it’s already proving its worth. Unlike DOGE and AVAX, 3BAY isn’t just another tradable asset—it’s a real solution to online commerce barriers. With a presale raising over $1.6M, 390 million+ tokens sold, and a projected 6,430% ROI at launch, Web3Bay is attracting early investors looking for substantial gains and long-term adoption. Avalanche (AVAX) Struggles at $25 – Will Bulls Defend Key Support? Avalanche (AVAX) is facing renewed selling pressure, slipping 3% to $25 after failing to hold its recent $27 resistance. The token previously rebounded from a five-month low but is now at risk of further declines. If $24 support fails, AVAX could drop to $21.2 or even $17.3, mirroring its August 2024 lows. Despite the current bearish trend, a strong bounce from support could trigger a reversal, with resistance at $27.2, $31.5, and $38 as key targets. However, low trading volume suggests market indecision, and a surge in volume could determine the next major move. Investors are watching closely—a breakout could mean big gains, but another dip could offer a strategic buying opportunity. If bulls regain control, AVAX could be gearing up for a strong recovery in the coming weeks. Dogecoin (DOGE) Gearing Up for a Major Breakout? Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a potential breakout, with large holders aggressively accumulating despite recent market fluctuations. Transaction volume has surged 40%, indicating rising investor interest. Analysts believe this accumulation phase could trigger a strong upward move in the coming weeks. Whales holding 10M–100M DOGE have amassed over $6 billion since November, signaling growing confidence in DOGE’s long-term potential. Currently, DOGE is holding strong support at $0.23, with key resistance at $0.35. A breakout above this level could attract both retail and institutional buyers, pushing prices toward previous highs of $0.48. With a growing holder base and rising community engagement, Dogecoin is positioning itself for a potential rally. As crypto sentiment improves, investors looking for high-upside opportunities may find DOGE an attractive bet before momentum fully kicks in. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Innovation Most online marketplaces are controlled by centralized entities that make decisions without user input. Web3Bay is changing that by giving power to its community. The 3BAY token lets holders vote on platform updates, ensuring a decentralized governance system. Web3Bay is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales of 2025, offering a groundbreaking decentralized e-commerce platform that aims to disrupt traditional online marketplaces. By eliminating intermediaries, Web3Bay allows users to buy and sell goods with full control over their transactions, avoiding the high fees and restrictions imposed by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay. Its multi-chain payment system supports various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and even PayPal integration, bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 commerce. With over $1.6 million raised and more than 390 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s presale is gaining momentum at an unprecedented rate. Currently priced at $0.00524 in Stage 5, the token is expected to hit $0.1959 at launch, presenting a massive 3,639% potential ROI for early investors. Whales have already poured over $200,000 into Web3Bay within 24 hours, signaling growing institutional confidence in the project. Security is another key advantage, with Web3Bay leveraging IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for tamper-proof data storage, ensuring transactions remain decentralized and censorship-resistant. As e-commerce giants face increasing criticism for high fees and centralized control, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the future of online shopping, making it one of the top crypto investments of 2025. Final Outlook While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to attract attention, their success largely depends on market sentiment and short-term price movements. DOGE’s whale accumulation signals potential for a breakout, but its long-term value remains speculative. AVAX faces resistance at $27, with a risk of further decline if support fails. These assets offer trading opportunities, but neither presents the fundamental transformation that Web3Bay (3BAY) brings to the market. Web3Bay is not just another token—it’s a real-world solution to global e-commerce challenges. By removing high fees, banking restrictions, and centralized control, 3BAY creates a seamless, decentralized marketplace. Its hybrid payment system, NFT expansion, and decentralized governance model set it apart from typical crypto projects.

This follows a day of intense negotiations with both nations, suggesting a potential compromise in U.S. trade policy. The move could scale back some of the recently imposed 25% tariffs. Right away, the largest tech stock ETF rose nearly 1% in late trading, and index futures bounced back from their lows. These remarks came right after the U.S. stock market faced sharp declines for the second day, driven by fears that Trump’s tough trade policies could spark a full-blown trade war. Specifics Not Revealed! The Cabinet secretary didn’t reveal the specifics of Trump’s plans but hinted that the president would be open to meeting Canada and Mexico “in the middle.” He also suggested that Trump would not completely remove the tariffs. “Both the Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they’ll do better,” Lutnick said Tuesday afternoon. Lutnick hinted that any deal would need Canada and Mexico to address on issues Trump has criticised. He noted, “The President is fair and reasonable,” but added that Mexico and Canada must “do more” before any relief happens. The comments came just hours before Trump was scheduled to give a primetime speech to Congress. Trump Threatens For EU Tariffs Trump has always defended tariffs as a negotiation tool, claiming that Canada and Mexico haven’t done enough to stop drugs and crime from entering the U.S. Now, with the economic impact being felt, the administration seems ready to adjust its approach, but not entirely. Tariffs on China began in February, and China retaliated. Trump then raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%, and China will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. farm goods starting Monday. Trump also threatened new tariffs on the EU, possibly extending the trade war to Europe. Impact On The Crypto Market The tariff announcement yesterday had caused havoc in the crypto markets as well with Bitcoin dropping over 9% to $83K levels, while Ethereum plunged 15% and altcoin saw a steep decline as well. Bitcoin is now trading at $87,723, up over 4% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin like Ethererum, XRP, SOL and Cardano have also experienced slight increase as they are up over 5%, 9%, 5%, and 22% respectively over the past day. The crypto market cap is close to $4 trillion today, with an increase of 4% in the past day. Crypto-related stocks also have seen gains: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is up 9.55%, Coinbase (COIN) is up 3.22%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) has gained 1.34%.

The first major resistance is near the $2,275 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,275 resistance might send the price toward the $2,350 resistance. An upside break above the $2,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions.

THE NEXT 1000X CRYPTO – CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW! OFFICIALMAGACOIN: A New Entrant with Explosive Potential Launched recently, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has made a remarkable entrance by raising over $3.8 million within minutes during its presale phase. This rapid capital influx underscores strong investor confidence and suggests a robust demand for the token. The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability. While it holds promise, these issues may impact its ability to sustain the momentum required for a 1000x surge.

In his latest post on X, the analyst references historical price behavior, a potential channel formation, and precise technical indicators to suggest that XRP may be on the verge of a swift move toward the $27-$33 price range. The timeframe for this potential surge, according to his analysis, could be as short as 28 days if conditions mirror XRP’s 2017 bull run. XRP Price To Hit $33? Egrag opens his post by acknowledging the risk and difficulty of making time-based forecasts. “Sometimes, I throw myself under the bus with time predictions, but honestly, it’s worth sharing with the community! Even though I know it might backfire, I still give it a shot,” he writes. He also reiterates his broader philosophy: “Now, let me be clear—I never try to time the market because it’s nearly impossible. Instead, I follow the golden rule: ‘Time in the market is more important than timing the market!’” This balance between caution and optimism underscores the delicate nature of technical analyses in unpredictable cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: XRP Price Can Fall Further To $1.5 If This Level Fails To Hold The centerpiece of Egrag’s analysis is a potential weekly channel that he believes strongly resembles the price structure XRP exhibited in 2017. He points out that, during that period, the cycle leading from the channel’s inception to the final breakout lasted approximately 175 days. Within that timespan, the token recorded a rise of about 2,500% from the lower boundary of the channel. That surge culminated in a cycle “blow-off top,” a term used by traders to describe a rapid price climb followed by an even quicker reversal. According to Egrag, these chart features appear to be resurfacing now, with XRP showing signs of maintaining support above the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). “We’re seeing similar XRP price action today, with the 21 EMA closing above and only a minor wick,” he notes, suggesting that the token’s price is finding strength near a well-watched moving average. Such support, if sustained, can be an early indicator that bullish momentum is building. One of the most eye-catching points in Egrag’s chart is his projection that XRP could climb toward the Fib 1.618 extension level, where he places a tentative target between $27 and $33. He explains that, if 2017’s channel pattern truly echoes today’s structure, XRP may replicate a similar percentage gain and time duration before hitting that upper range. “If we apply this same pattern to the current market, XRP could surge to the Fib 1.618 level, targeting $27-$33!” he writes. He further suggests that this parabolic move “could happen within just 28 days,” based on his historical observations. Before reaching this high, XRP could first target the Fib 1.272 level at $8.38, followed by the Fib 1.414 level at $13.67. These are historically relevant Fibonacci extension points that traders often monitor as price advances in an uptrend. Related Reading: XRP Price Bubble Burst? This Pattern Suggests Imminent Drop To $1.1 In the immediate short term, XRP is currently positioned at the 0.888 Fibonacci retracement level ($2.23), with additional support at the 0.786 level ($1.57) and 0.702 level ($1.78). These levels suggest that XRP is consolidating within a structured Fibonacci-based pattern before an anticipated breakout. This 28-day forecast is arguably the most striking part of his analysis, reflecting a break from his usual reluctance to pin down short-term timelines. Egrag concedes that timing market moves is notoriously challenging but remains confident that reviewing past cycles can still offer valuable insights. “Even though I know it might backfire, I still give it a shot,” he remarks, acknowledging the inherent volatility and unpredictability of crypto assets. At press time, XRP traded at $2.32.

Sigel outlined three major proposals — SIMD 096, SIMD 0123, and SIMD 0228 — in a post on X on Mar. 4. These proposals seek to improve Solana’s ( SOL ) economic framework but have the potential to reduce validator revenue by up to 95%. Solana has several upcoming protocol upgrades, known as SIMDs, aimed at enhancing its technical capabilities and economic framework. These changes could help stabilize and strengthen Solana's position in the crypto ecosystem moving forward. Solana recently implemented SIMD 096… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) March 4, 2025 Solana’s SIMD 096, implemented on Feb. 12, redirected 100% of priority fees to validators, eliminating the previous system that burned half of these fees. Staking payouts increased as a result, but off-chain trading agreements between validators and traders were deterred. SimD 0123, which is currently up for vote, would further divert revenue away from node operators by requiring validators to pay priority fees to stakers. SIMD 0228, the most contentious proposal scheduled for a vote on Mar. 6, would modify Solana’s inflation rate based on stake participation. The network’s yearly inflation rate would decrease from 4.7% to 0.93% if staking levels stayed at 63%. This would lower token dilution but also reduce staking rewards, much to the disadvantage of validators. You might also like: Hamster Network hits 34,028 TPS, surpassing Solana and Aptos Validators are mainly concermed about the high operating costs required to run nodes. These include mandatory voting fees of 1.1 SOL each day (about $58,000 yearly) and hardware expenditures of approximately $6,000 annually. Since only 458 of Solana’s 1,323 validators own a sufficient amount of stake to turn a profit , smaller operators risk being forced out. Lowering voting fees has been proposed by several community members as a way to alleviate financial strain. Despite the controversy, Sigel maintained that reducing inflation would benefit SOL in the long run by lowering sell pressure and supporting the token’s value. Solana’s network activity remains strong. With $109 billion in February, the blockchain has surpassed Ethereum for the fifth consecutive month, demonstrating its dominance in decentralized exchange volume, according to DeFiLlama data . The current plans, however, might render operating a node unfeasible for small validators, which could result in even more centralization. Read more: What is Physical Bitcoin?

It is now eyeing to break the $2 mark. Pi Network has seen a major drop from its all-time high of $3, now trading around the range of $1.60-$1.70. Despite the broader market downturn, investor sentiment remains hopeful, with signs that a reversal could be on the horizon. The MACD indicator shows potential bullish momentum, but with the RSI still below 50, recovery may be slow until market conditions improve Adding to the bullish theory, the X account ‘Binance Intern’ tweeted some intriguing messages. The first tweet read, “If you’re reading this, you’re a real one,” followed by the Pi symbol. This is the first time Binance has directly referenced Pi Coin in this way. Could it be a joke? Maybe. But it sure looks like they’re giving Pi some attention. In another tweet, they asked, “If your favorite project was a dessert, what would it be?” and posted a slice of pie emoji. These tweets have been getting massive attention and this could be a way for Binance to gauge the Pi community’s interest. What’s next for Pi Coin? The big news is that Pi Day (March 14th) is approaching, and experts believe that’s when Pi Coin could be listed on Binance. If Binance lists Pi, it will put pressure on other exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com, and Gemini to list it too. Pi’s trading volume is huge right now and other exchanges will want a piece of that action. Pi Coin’s community is one of the strongest out there. People have been mining Pi since 2019, and many are holding onto their coins for the long term, even locking them up until 2027.

The asset’s latest price action shows signs of upward momentum, with analysts debating whether this breakout is sustainable. Meanwhile, on-chain data reveal a SOL whale transferred 494,153 SOL, valued at $71.95 million, to Coinbase Institutional, adding further speculation about market movements. Solana Price Attempts Breakout From Descending Channel In recent Solana price analysis, technical indicators suggest the asset is challenging key resistance after weeks of downward movement. A descending parallel channel has been restricting its price, but the latest attempt to break above this trendline has drawn attention from traders. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart showing Solana price moving past its downtrend resistance, targeting a potential rally toward $213. If confirmed, this move could indicate a shift from a bearish trend to a more sustained uptrend. However, analyst Seth maintains a cautious outlook, suggesting that Solana price remains within the broader channel, facing resistance at crucial levels. Source: X Whale Transfers 494,153 SOL to Coinbase Institutional Additionally, blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported a SOL whale moving 494,153 SOL, worth approximately $71.95 million, to Coinbase Institutional. Large-scale transfers of this magnitude often attract market attention, as they may indicate either selling pressure or institutional accumulation. If the transferred SOL is intended for liquidation, it could introduce selling pressure, potentially affecting the ongoing breakout attempt. However, if the transaction is related to over-the-counter (OTC) trading or institutional accumulation, it may signal increased demand, which could support further upward movement. According to recent Solana whale activities, SOL price might be headed for a breakout to $180. A whale’s $14 million accumulation eased selling pressure, supporting the recent rebound to $145. If momentum sustains, breaking the $170 resistance could pave the way for a SOL rally toward $180. Buyers Return as SAR and MACD Suggest a Breakout Meanwhile, Solana price technical indicators have also turned bullish, supporting the potential breakout. The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator, represented by the dotted blue lines, has shifted below the price candles, signaling a possible trend reversal to the upside. This suggests that selling pressure is weakening and buyers are regaining control, increasing the likelihood of a sustained price recovery. Source: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Histogram further reinforce this bullish sentiment. The MACD line has started converging toward the signal line, reducing the bearish momentum. Additionally, the histogram bars have begun turning green, indicating a potential crossover into positive territory. This shift suggests that buying pressure is building up, which could support an upward move toward $170 and possibly $180 if resistance levels are breached. However, historical resistance between $175 and $185 remains a significant test for the asset. To confirm a true breakout, Solana price needs to maintain high-volume closes above these levels. Failure to do so may result in a rejection, pushing the asset back into the descending channel. More so, the Solana network has outpaced Ethereum in terms of active users and transaction efficiency. This has lead to speculations that SOL price could hit $500 before ETH price reaches $5,000. With 73.4 million monthly active addresses compared to Ethereum’s 7.4 million, Solana’s adoption rate suggests strong upside potential. If this growth trend continues, analysts believe SOL could outperform ETH in the near term.

The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2.40 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Ripple Lawsuit Continues: The crypto community is now eagerly awaiting the outcome of the ongoing Ripple case. Despite the SEC’s recent dismissal of cases against several cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap and Gemini among others, the lawsuit against Ripple Labs remains unresolved. Additionally, President Donald Trump’s recent announcement designating XRP, Ripple’s native token, as part of the U.S. government’s strategic cryptocurrency reserve has raised expectations for a favorable resolution. Ripple’s legal team has asked for a deadline of April 16, 2025, to submit their cross-appeal. This date is important because it could affect how the case moves forward. Experts believe the case could be resolved before this date, but no official updates have been given yet.

Scott Bessent Hints at Rate Cuts,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-interest-rates-go-down-today-scott-bessent-hints-at-rate-cuts/,"The post Did Interest Rates Go Down Today? Scott Bessent Hints at Rate Cuts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent brushed off concerns about a Wall Street selloff following the White House’s trade war with Canada, China, and Mexico. Speaking on Fox & Friends , Bessent emphasized that President Trump’s main focus is improving the living standards of everyday Americans, despite market worries over the 20-25% tariffs on key trading partners. Rebalancing The Economy Bessent stated that, although Wall Street has been successful, the primary focus is on supporting small businesses and consumers. He highlighted that the goal is to rebalance the economy to benefit everyday Americans in the long run. Bessent’s comments came shortly after the tariffs took effect, causing the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to drop nearly 2% in the morning, now 10% lower than its peak on December 16. “One of the biggest wins for the American people, since election day and since inauguration, mortgage rates have come down dramatically,” he said. “The bottom 50% of Americans over the past two years have gotten crushed by these high interest rates.” Mortage Rates See Massive Drop Bessent said that mortgage rates have dropped significantly since Election Day and the inauguration. He believes this decline is partly due to expected bank deregulation, which could have a positive impact on the economy and mortgage rates. 30-year mortgage rates dropped to 6.76% on Thursday, the lowest in two months, down from 6.85% last week. They had peaked at a 10-year high of 7.79% on October 26, 2023, during Biden administration. Bessent Dismises Inflation Concerns Over Tariffs Some economists worry that the tariffs could drive inflation up and keep interest rates high through 2026. Bessent dismissed concerns that tariffs would increase inflation, pointing to Honda moving production from Mexico to Indiana to avoid them. He’s confident that manufacturers will absorb the tariffs, keeping prices steady, and believes the U.S. is in a middle of “transition” with Canada and Mexico. Bessent explained that lower interest rates would not only help homeowners but also reduce the costs of credit cards and auto loans, which have hurt low-income Americans. “Bringing interest rates down is one of our greatest achievements so far,” he said. He noted that while inflation is easing, it is still not back to the Fed’s target. However, Bessent remarked that affordability has been hit hard over the past few years, when asked about the impact of affordability on inflation. Since Trump took office, investors now expect the Fed to cut rates three times by the end of 2025, lowering the federal funds rate from 4.25%-4.5% to 3.5%-3.75%. This is a shift from just one expected rate cut when Trump first took office.",News|Crypto news|Fed,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 04:40:47

With meme coins surging in popularity, the search for the next big winner is on. While Floki Inu and Non-Playable Coin have been making headlines, all eyes are now on Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), a rising star in the meme coin space. Floki Inu recently announced a major marketing push, while Non-Playable Coin has been expanding its metaverse integration. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is the real game-changer, with an innovative token burn mechanism and a presale structure unlike anything seen before. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin , Non-Playable Coin, and Floki Inu. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: How Token Burns Drive Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) introduces a powerful deflationary model through its token burn mechanism. By permanently removing unsold tokens from circulation every week during the presale, APC ensures increasing scarcity, which can drive value upward. Not only that, but any tokens left unsold after the presale will also be burned, further reducing supply and fostering a deflationary environment. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), all burn transactions are recorded transparently, adding an extra layer of trust. This strategy is designed to enhance investor confidence and create a long-term growth trajectory for the token. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Enter ChillVille Before Prices Rise! Arctic Pablo Coin has now reached ChillVille, the 13th stage of its unique meme coin presale journey, where APC is available at just $0.000070. With an ROI potential of over 11,285.71% from this stage to its launch price of $0.008, the opportunity to secure massive gains is closing fast. Over $1.74 million has already been raised, proving the overwhelming demand for this project. Unlike traditional presales, Arctic Pablo Coin’s sale isn’t divided into rounds but by locations as it “travels,” adding an exciting narrative to its journey. As each new location is reached, prices increase, making ChillVille one of the last stops before a major price jump. Those who get in now at the lowest entry point stand to benefit the most. With its next location on the horizon, the chance to buy at $0.000070 is fading quickly. Non-Playable Coin: Expanding the Metaverse Frontier Non-Playable Coin is making waves with its latest push into the metaverse, introducing new partnerships that enhance its virtual ecosystem. This strategic move positions it as a key player in the NFT gaming space, attracting a broader audience. With metaverse adoption growing rapidly, Non-Playable Coin’s innovations could set the stage for long-term success. As Arctic Pablo Coin gains traction, Non-Playable Coin’s latest developments add to the excitement in the meme coin space. Floki Inu: Marketing Blitz Boosts Community Growth Floki Inu has ramped up its global marketing campaigns, securing high-profile sponsorships and expanding its reach. With a strong community and increasing adoption, this strategic expansion could drive further price appreciation. As the meme coin market heats up, Floki Inu’s aggressive branding efforts keep it at the forefront of investor interest alongside Arctic Pablo Coin and Non-Playable Coin. Analysts Predict $0.10 for APC—A Million-Dollar Opportunity? Crypto analysts are bullish on Arctic Pablo Coin, forecasting a massive price surge to $0.10 post-listing. With its listing price set at $0.008, early investors at the current $0.000070 price point could see life-changing returns. A $1,000 investment today would secure 14,285,714 APC tokens, translating to $114,285 at listing and an astonishing $1,428,571 when the price hits $0.10. The potential for such gains has made Arctic Pablo Coin one of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now . As the project continues its journey through new locations, the window for early investment is closing fast. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge Meme coins continue to capture investor attention, with Non-Playable Coin diving deeper into the metaverse and Floki Inu leveraging aggressive marketing strategies. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique presale structure and deflationary model set it apart. With its token burn mechanism, strategic price hikes, and massive ROI potential, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as a top pick among meme coin investors. As ChillVille nears its end, those looking to enter at the lowest price point must act fast before APC’s next price jump.

ADA has gained a whopping 16% in the last 24 hours. Ripple’s XRP has also bounced back in the last 24 hours and is up by more than 6%. The price is now trading at $2.44, eyeing to break levels above $2.50. Bearish Divergence on the 3-Day Chart According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , XRP has been showing signs of a bearish divergence on the 3-day time frame. This means that while the price has been making higher highs, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been making lower highs. This divergence has been present for some time, and despite short-term bounces, it suggests that we might not see a strong bullish trend anytime soon. Until XRP sees a confirmation of an invalidation signal, the bearish trend could still continue. Short-Term Price Action: Support and Resistance Levels The price is currently bouncing from a significant support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. If XRP breaks below this level, it could drop to the next major support zone around $2. Currently, there’s a lack of strong momentum in either direction, so we may see sideways movement in the short term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Lawsuit News: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Says ‘Trump Has To Drop’ The Case , The RSI has recently reset to neutral levels, which could lead to more stable, less volatile price action. In the past, when the RSI reset from overbought conditions, XRP experienced relatively flat price movement for a few days. Resistance Levels to Watch If XRP continues its short-term bounce, key resistance levels to watch are between $2.65 and $2.80. Additional resistance could be found around $3.00, with a possible short-term resistance at $2.50 based on previous support turning into resistance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On February 26, Story (IP) surged beyond $7, following a massive 115% rally. However, within hours, the token dropped by 15%, indicating the volatility of the market despite initial bullish sentiment. The A.I. market, including Story (IP)holders, now eyes Coldware (COLD) as the next potential standout, with growing interest in its decentralized gaming platform and blockchain-based infrastructure. Coldware (COLD), already making waves in the GameFi sector, offers a refreshing twist for Story (IP) holders who are witnessing this retracement. As Story (IP) prices fluctuate, Coldware’s focus on blockchain technology that powers game economies provides Story (IP) holders an interesting investment alternative, promising both short-term rewards and long-term growth. Story (IP)’s Price Retracement and Coldware’s Potential After Story (IP) hit its peak, the retracement became a talking point for investors watching Coldware (COLD). With Story (IP) facing pressure, Coldware is seen as an ideal move for those looking to diversify their holdings in the blockchain gaming space. Coldware (COLD) offers a solid investment case, especially as it integrates seamlessly into GameFi ecosystems, a sector that has proven to be a high-growth area within the cryptocurrency world. As Story (IP) faces challenges in regaining its upward momentum, Coldware (COLD) continues to attract a strong following among traders. Despite Story (IP)’s bullish run, the new Coldware (COLD) layer offers multiple use cases within the gaming industry, and its continued development is expected to boost its value in the coming months. Coldware’s (COLD) position within blockchain gaming represents an exciting entry point for investors, including Story (IP)holders who may be seeking a new and innovative way to capitalize on the booming sector. With Story (IP) retracing after its rally, Coldware’s rise within GameFi continues to hold significant potential. Could Coldware (COLD) Surpass Story (IP)? As Story (IP) faces retracement, it is important to consider the broader picture of the A.I. market, where Coldware (COLD) could potentially take the lead. If Coldware (COLD) continues to develop its offerings in blockchain gaming, it could surpass Story (IP) in terms of adoption and usage. Coldware is quickly becoming a dominant player in GameFi, and as the market shows signs of retracement for Story (IP), Coldware (COLD)’s value proposition in decentralized gaming continues to resonate with A.I. investors.

This decline has led to a wave of liquidations totaling $1 billion over the past 24 hours, as leveraged traders faced significant losses amid the market correction. According to Coinglass, a total of 305,170 traders were liquidated during this period, reflecting the impact of Bitcoin’s latest decline in price on investor positions. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Range The Next Key Resistance, Analytics Firm Says Detailing The Total Liquidations The majority of liquidations came from long positions, where traders had bet on Bitcoin’s price increasing. As the market moved against them, forced sell-offs occurred, accelerating the downward momentum. Data from Coinglass shows that long liquidations accounted for over 80% of the total, reaching $833.24 million, while short liquidations were significantly lower at $170.08 million. Among the affected crypto exchanges, Bybit and Binance recorded the highest liquidation volumes, with $411.54 million and $242.25 million, respectively. Bitcoin itself accounted for the largest share of the total liquidations, contributing $371.66 million. Ethereum (ETH) was the second most impacted cryptocurrency, with $200.94 million in liquidations, while other crypto assets collectively accounted for over $100 million. The single largest liquidation order took place on Bitfinex, with a $13.40 million BTC position being forcefully closed. The high liquidation volume suggests that many traders were caught off guard by Bitcoin’s price drop. With long positions dominating liquidations, it indicates that market sentiment was largely bullish before the downturn. Market Outlook: Can Bitcoin Recover Soon? Despite the sharp downturn, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Crypto analyst Javon Marks noted that despite the recent decline, indicators still suggest Bitcoin could be gearing up for a larger bullish rally. Signs are still pointing towards a monumental bullish rally for Bitcoin.$BTC — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) March 4, 2025 Meanwhile, RektCapital pointed out that Bitcoin’s decline has resulted in a fully filled CME gap between $84,650 and $93,300, which could potentially lead to a price reversal in the near term.

Qubetics Presale—A Limited-Time Window for Early Buyers If you’re looking for the best crypto presale to join right now, Qubetics is the one to watch. The project is currently in Stage 24, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0976. Over 495 million tokens have been sold, raising a staggering $14.5 million and bringing in over 22,100 token holders. But here’s the kicker—presale prices increase every 7 days, with a 10% price jump every Sunday at midnight. And the potential gains? Mind-blowing. $TICS at $0.25 (presale end) = 155.93% ROI $TICS at $1 (post-presale) = 923.72% ROI $TICS at $5 (long-term) = 5,018.58% ROI $TICS at $10 (mainnet launch) = 10,137.16% ROI $TICS at $15 (mainnet success) = 15,255.75% ROI For example, a $1,000 investment today at $0.0976 per token would give you 10,246 tokens. If $TICS hits $10 post-mainnet launch, that’s a $102,460 return. With the mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, early buyers are locking in their spots before prices explode. 2. Filecoin (FIL) — Decentralizing Data Storage for the Web3 Era The internet is built on data storage, and today, tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft control the industry. But Filecoin is changing the game, offering a decentralized storage network (DSN) where anyone can rent out extra storage space, creating a Web3-powered alternative to centralized cloud providers. Why does this matter? Because businesses, developers, and individuals need secure, censorship-resistant, and cost-effective storage solutions. With the rise of AI, NFTs, and DeFi, demand for decentralized storage is surging—and Filecoin is at the forefront. Currently, FIL trades at a fraction of its all-time high, making it an attractive long-term play. As Web3 adoption accelerates, Filecoin’s network effect and demand for decentralized data storage could send FIL skyrocketing. 3. Cosmos (ATOM) — The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is solving one of crypto’s biggest challenges: blockchain fragmentation. Right now, most blockchains operate in isolation, unable to interact with each other efficiently. Cosmos fixes this with its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, creating an internet of blockchains where assets and data flow seamlessly. Think of it as the highway system for blockchain networks—instead of each blockchain being a standalone island, Cosmos builds bridges between them, making transactions and smart contract execution much faster and more efficient. With the rapid expansion of DeFi, gaming, and enterprise adoption, Cosmos’ role as an interoperability powerhouse could push ATOM into massive growth territory in the coming years. 4. Polygon (MATIC) — Ethereum’s Scaling Powerhouse Ethereum is the most-used blockchain in the world, but it’s notorious for high fees and slow transaction speeds. Polygon is solving this by building Layer 2 solutions that make Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more scalable. With top-tier partnerships (including Starbucks, Nike, and Disney) and increasing adoption in DeFi and gaming, Polygon is cementing itself as Ethereum’s go-to scaling solution. As the Ethereum ecosystem expands, Polygon’s demand will only continue to rise, making it one of the best cryptos with 1000X potential to invest in right now . Conclusion: The Crypto Projects Set to Explode The days of betting on meme coins and hype-driven projects are over—real utility is what drives long-term growth. Qubetics is leading the charge by fixing blockchain interoperability and revolutionizing cross-border payments. Filecoin, Cosmos, and Polygon each bring massive real-world use cases to the table, making them top contenders for explosive gains in 2025. For those looking for serious upside potential, Qubetics’ crypto presale is currently the hottest opportunity. With its mainnet launching in Q2 2025 and potential for 10,000%+ ROI, early buyers are locking in before the next price jump. Don’t miss out on one of the best crypto presales in 2025!

DOGE tested $0.1820 and is now consolidating below the $0.2150 resistance. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.2150 and $0.2100 levels. The price is trading below the $0.2100 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1900 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a recovery if it clears the $0.2050 and $0.2120 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Recovery Dogecoin price started a fresh decline below the $0.2150 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.2050 and $0.200 support levels. It even spiked below $0.1880. A low was formed at $0.1826 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the $0.1950 level. The bulls pushed the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2421 swing high to the $0.1826 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1900 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2050 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2120 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2421 swing high to the $0.1826 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.2195 level. A close above the $0.2195 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2220 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2350 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2050 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1950 level. The next major support is near the $0.1920 level. The main support sits at $0.1820. If there is a downside break below the $0.1820 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1740 level or even $0.1650 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

With BTFD Coin’s presale surging past $6.25 million, Moo Deng seeing a notable trading volume increase, and Turbo facing a market shift, meme coin enthusiasts are watching closely. Right now, BTFD Coin is making waves in the staking world, offering a massive 90% APY and a limited-time referral bonus that has investors stacking up tokens before the final presale stages. Meanwhile, Moo Deng’s rising market activity is catching attention, and Turbo is experiencing a cooldown after recent volatility. The real question is—which of these three projects offers the best potential for significant returns? BTFD Coin’s Presale Momentum and Analysts’ Predictions FOMO is kicking in as BTFD Coin’s presale continues to gain traction, drawing in over 11,200 bulls and selling more than 71 billion tokens at $0.00016 per coin. With only two presale stages left, investors are jumping in before prices rise again. But what’s really driving this surge? BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a staking powerhouse. Investors who lock in now secure a 90% APY, making it one of the best cryptos to stake for passive income. On top of that, BTFD’s referral program is adding fuel to the fire, giving users a 10% bonus on all referred purchases and extra rewards for top referrers. But here’s where it gets even more exciting—BTFD Coin’s $0.006 moon target. Analysts predict that once it lists, it could see massive price surges, and early investors are eyeing a potential 3650% ROI. A $15,000 investment at $0.00016 right now would secure 93,750,000 BTFD tokens. At $0.0006 listing price, that turns into $56,250, and if it hits the projected moon price of $0.006, that same investment would explode to $562,500. Getting in on BTFD’s presale is easy. Investors simply need to: Set up a wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Connect to the BTFD presale page and select the purchase amount. Enter the 100% BONUS CODE “LAUNCH100” and double their tokens instantly. Confirm the transaction and secure their BTFD tokens. With the presale stages closing fast, this is one of the last chances to own the dip before prices shoot up. Moo Deng Gains Interest as Trading Volume Climbs Moo Deng is not your average meme coin. Inspired by a viral pygmy hippo, this Solana-based project is building traction in the meme coin market. Despite an 18.77% price drop in the last 24 hours, its trading volume has risen by 22.59%, signaling renewed interest. With its unique branding and growing niche appeal, Moo Deng has the potential to ride the next meme coin wave. Investors are watching for signs of a market reversal, as increased trading volume often precedes price movement. While Moo Deng’s current trend is uncertain, it remains one of the more talked-about meme coins on Solana. Its ability to capture attention through viral branding has positioned it as a potential breakout player in the meme coin space. Turbo Faces Market Shifts After Recent Drops Turbo made history as the first-ever AI-generated meme coin, created through GPT-4’s direction. But after seeing explosive early success, it’s now experiencing a market cooldown, with its price dropping 15.34% in the last 24 hours and trading volume down by 16.75%. Despite these dips, Turbo’s community remains strong, and its unique AI-driven narrative keeps it relevant in the evolving crypto landscape. Many investors see Turbo’s pullback as a potential buying opportunity, while others wait for the next major push in market sentiment. The real challenge for Turbo will be regaining momentum in a competitive meme coin sector. With projects like BTFD Coin offering staking rewards and referral incentives, investors seeking immediate gains may find better opportunities elsewhere. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is emerging as the top contender among meme coins right now. With its 90% APY staking, referral rewards, and explosive presale growth, it’s easily one of the best cryptos to stake for significant gains. Meanwhile, Moo Deng is gaining traction with increased trading volume, indicating stronger market interest, while Turbo navigates its latest price fluctuations. Both projects have potential, but BTFD Coin’s combination of staking, presale momentum, and analyst predictions is setting it apart as the best pick. With BTFD’s presale nearing its final stages, this is the last chance to get in before the price jumps. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and own the dip before it’s too late. FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the best cryptos to stake? BTFD Coin offers a 90% APY staking program, a high-paying referral system, and strong presale momentum, making it a top choice for passive income seekers. Is Moo Deng’s volume increase a sign of a market recovery? Moo Deng’s 22.59% trading volume increase suggests growing interest, but its price action remains uncertain. Many investors are watching for further movement before making a decision. Can Turbo regain its momentum after its price dip? Turbo’s AI-driven meme coin status keeps it in the conversation, but its recent price decline and lower trading volume suggest a period of consolidation before its next potential move.

This company created the cryptocurrencies Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST). Kwon's career is notable. He co-founded Terraform Labs in January 2018 with Daniel Shin. Their goal is to enhance payment systems using blockchain technology. This effort led to the creation of the Terra blockchain and its tokens, LUNA and UST.Details:Organization: Terra MoneyLocation: South KoreaEducation: BS in Computer Science from Stanford University Experience:Founder & CEO at Terraform Labs logo from Jan 2018 - Present Founder & CEO at Anyfi Inc. from Jan 2016 - Oct 2017 FAQ's1.

What is the net worth of Do Kwon?Do Kwon's net worth is $10 Billion Entrepreneur Crypto and Blockchain Expert Chief Executive Officer fate is set in stone! Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon’s U.S. court hearing has been postponed after prosecutors uncovered a massive trail of new evidence. Originally set for March 6, the hearing will now occur on April 10, giving both sides more time to review the findings. For those asking, I can confirm Do Kwon's status conference has been pushed back from March to April to account for additional evidence discovery The government is adding 4 cellphones belonging to Kwon to the stack of evidence Trial still set to begin in January 2026 pic.twitter.com/OALr78EnlY — Zack Guzmán (@zGuz) March 4, 2025 There Is More to Unearth! After reviewing the details, Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Manhattan federal court granted the delay after prosecutors revealed they had discovered an additional four terabytes of evidence, including data from various electronic accounts and third-party entities. This follows a release of 600GB of evidence containing Do Kwon’s phone data, emails, and crypto transaction records. Despite this delay, Kwon’s final trial is still scheduled for January 26, 2026. The court has ordered both sides to submit pretrial motions by July 1, with responses due by August 11. Meanwhile, Do Kwon pleaded not guilty and said he was shocked to see the market reaction post-Terra collapse. The Fallout from Terra’s Collapse Kwon’s legal troubles stem from the dramatic collapse of Terraform Labs’ ecosystem in May 2022. The algorithmic stablecoin TerraClassicUSD (USTC) lost its peg and plummeted below $0.01, triggering panic selling that wiped out $60 billion in market value. The collapse of USTC also dragged down the Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) token, causing widespread investor losses. Following the collapse, Kwon moved between Singapore and Dubai before being arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 while attempting to travel with a fake Costa Rican passport. He served a four-month prison sentence before being extradited to the U.S. in December 2024 . On January 2, 2025, Kwon appeared before a U.S. judge and pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges related to fraud. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: SEC Drops Another Case, And it’s Not Ripple Lawsuit , SEC Takes Action Against Kwon and Terraform Labs In addition to criminal charges, Kwon and Terraform Labs are facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has accused Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of the Terra ecosystem. In April 2024, a jury found both Kwon and Terraform Labs guilty of defrauding investors. Following the verdict, the SEC sought $5.3 billion in fines, citing it as a conservative estimate of the fraudulent gains. The court ultimately imposed a $4.5 billion penalty on Kwon and Terraform Labs, adding to their mounting legal challenges. With more evidence coming to light, the case against Do Kwon continues to unfold, keeping the crypto industry on edge as one of its most controversial figures fights legal battles on multiple fronts. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With stock and crypto markets already in chaos over his new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, Trump doubled down on his support for Elon’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the group leading the charge to gut federal spending and slash jobs. “And Elon is doing a great job,” Trump said. “He didn’t need this. He’s doing America a favor, and we really appreciate it.” Then, in true Trump fashion, he looked over at the Democrats, nodded toward their side, and added, “Even this side appreciates it, trust me. They’re just not gonna admit it.” Across the room, the Democrats had brought along military veterans and former government workers—people who lost their jobs thanks to Elon’s campaign. They held up protest signs that read, “False,” and “Protect veterans.” document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sotu2025.trump_.2a_v2_ec5064k.mp4 Trump appreciates D.O.G.E. Source: WSJ Elon’s D.O.G.E wipes billions in claimed savings DOGE has been on a deletion spree, wiping out claims of savings faster than they appeared. Late Sunday night, the group removed or altered more than 1,000 contracts it had previously said were canceled. That’s over 40% of all contracts listed just a week ago, bringing down its total savings claims from an initial $16 billion to less than $9 billion. Among the deleted entries were five of the seven biggest savings claims DOGE had boasted about. A $1.9 billion IRS contract for tech services? Gone. The New York Times found out the contract had already been canceled under Biden in November. A $149 million contract for three administrative assistants at the Department of Health and Human Services? Disappeared. The numbers didn’t match up, and a completely different contract was mistakenly linked. Another $133 million in so-called savings came from a US Agency for International Development contract for work in Libya. The contractor, Chemonics International, had already wrapped up the project last year. Yet DOGE took credit for canceling it. Even after all these changes, the errors haven’t stopped. As of Monday morning, DOGE’s site still claimed a $106 million savings from two Coast Guard contracts. A quick check of federal records showed those contracts ended back in 2005 and 2006—during the George W. Bush administration. Confusion over D.O.G.E’s Wall of Receipts DOGE had initially launched its “wall of receipts” as a public showcase of all the canceled contracts that supposedly saved taxpayers over $100 billion. But with more deletions happening every week, the list is becoming less reliable. It’s also the only place where DOGE is giving a detailed public breakdown of its numbers, and it’s raising questions about just how accurate their figures really are. After multiple reports from media outlets pointing out the mistakes, DOGE quietly updated its website to shift responsibility. Now, a disclaimer says that all numbers “originate directly from agency contracting officials.” That doesn’t explain why so many of the claims keep vanishing. The shrinking savings total hasn’t slowed down Elon’s operation. DOGE keeps adding new canceled contracts to replace the deleted ones. But these new ones are worth smaller amounts, meaning that the total savings number is still dropping. Meanwhile, contracting and budget experts are raising concerns about DOGE’s overall competence, given how many mistakes keep piling up.

The latest Pepe price prediction remains bleak, following suit with an 80% drop from ATH. The Trump tariff and whale activity decline drove the steep downturn in the PEPE price. Eventually, negative sentiment flooded the market with massive token sell-offs, increasing selling pressure. But a low-cap gem, Panshibi is outperforming with its meme revolution and explosive potential this year. This viral crypto has drawn interest from PEPE investors seeking the next big opportunity for life-changing gains. Let’s dive right in. Panshibi: Low-cap Crypto With True Purpose While the PEPE price remains relatively unstable, Panshibi provides investors with the perfect security during this volatile period. Panshibi’s ace up its sleeves is its innovative approach to meme culture and community-focused initiatives. Since its presale launch, Panshibi has proven to be the lasting upgrade to meme culture’s fickle fad. The token is a panda-inspired meme coin, drawing its uniqueness from the fresh appeal away from the typical dog memes in the crypto market. To sweeten the pot, Panshibi runs an AI-powered social-fi platform where users can earn rewards for socializing with others, participating in quests, and being active community members. Moreover, holders get exclusive access to the Bamboo VIP membership club, where they can receive exciting rewards and perks. Panshibi is excelling where other meme coins are faltering hard. Its AI ingenuity provides value-driven utility a chance for meme enthusiasts to connect and earn passively. Its stake-to-earn program even provides up to 1200% APY that no savvy investors would sideline. All these had the Panshibi presale soaring high when meme stalwarts like PEPE took a dip. Demand for the project is skyrocketing as thousands of investors sink over $1.2M in its potential. The low-cap meme coin is available on presale at a very low price, and its value is expected to keep increasing until launch. Panshibi sells for $0.005 in the ongoing Stage 4 presale, but the $0.026 listing price offers over 400% profits. Panshibi looks like a ripe buy due to its lower volatility and higher growth potential. The meme coin is progressing well on presale and may explode after listing, making today the best time to join the revolution. Pepe Price Prediction: Bears Target 40% Loss As Whales Exit Long Positions Despite the bull’s effort to push the PEPE price out of its adversities, the meme coin made huge losses. Analysts’ lofty PEPE price predictions following its halving event in February all amounted to nothing. The meme token bucked expectations and traded low to new lows at 0.000007263. According to CoinGlass data, this steep drop triggered a wave of $20M liquidations. Several analysts believe this extreme sell-off will continue as whales exit their long positions. A crypto analytics firm reported that a single wallet deposited 430 billion PEPE, valued at $6.39 million, into Binance in February. Another whale offloaded 325.5 billion PEPE, worth $4.9 million, while additional large holders transferred millions more to exchanges. This influx of supply could significantly weaken the PEPE price, leading to a sharp decline. Even the technical outlook echoes the same sentiment, as PEPE recently closed under the 200 EMA on the daily chart. If PEPE maintains its bearish momentum and closes below the EMAs daily, it could extend the decline by nearly 40% from current levels and retest its April 2024 low of $0.00000450. Panshibi Presale: Momentum Builds With The Upcoming Price Surge The window of opportunity in the Panshibi presale is closing fast, especially now that PEPE holders are securing positions. This exciting prospect is currently in Stage 4 out of 15, with tokens selling for just $0.005. Investor interest rises as its presale funds exceed $1.2 million, setting the stage for the next price surge. Act now to join the next meme revolution.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin were both front-page news during past bull cycles, but Remittix’s explosive growth, with 3.4x returns, is leaving most traders in awe. As meme coins still enjoy huge followings, the question is whether the price momentum can still keep up with upstarts with practical use cases. Shiba Inu’s Ongoing Surge Shiba Inu is in the spotlight again. The token is at $0.00001408, up 1.31% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $8.27 billion. Its 24-hour volume jumped 201.93% to $459.28 million, which is driving rumors that Shiba Inu can be what it once was. Ethereum’s April upgrade can be a fresh catalyst for SHIB according to uKastlFatu’s tweet . In spite of the hype, there are questions regarding how Shiba Inu will perform in an evolving market that values real-world utility more than memes. Trump’s executive order, which named tokens like XRP, SOL, and ADA, did not specifically name meme coins. However, the Shiba Inu community hopes that dedicated supporters and ecosystem expansion will propel another rally. Dogecoin Eyes a Golden Cross Dogecoin is $0.2198 , rising 5.47% in 24 hours, on the back of a 302.87% increase in volume to $4.02 billion. A David Dogecoin post refers to an imminent “golden cross,” as the 100-day moving average is about to cross over the 200-day line. The technical measure in the past predicts a bull price run, and this is stoking hopes that $DOGE will “moon” soon. But Dogecoin’s trajectory is that of Shiba Inu’s—both are subject to social sentiment. While Senator Cynthia Lummis and others worry about institutionally friendly assets for a future US Crypto Reserve, meme coin enthusiasts see each speculative cycle as an opportunity. The real test for Dogecoin is whether its future technical indicators turn into long-term gains. Remittix: The 3.4x Phenomenon Whereas Dogecoin and Shiba Inu follow well-trodden meme coin ground, Remittix has flown below the radar to spoil early adopters with a 3.4x return, thanks to its PayFi bridge between blockchain and real-world finance. Already trading at $0.0694, the token has already sold more than 515 million units, raising almost $13.5 million in presale. Unlike Shiba Inu’s dependence on community frenzy, Remittix is targeting a massive global remittance market through instant crypto-to-fiat conversions. Imagine one South American business owner who imports goods from Asia on a regular basis, for example. With Remittix, they can receive crypto payments, which they can instantly exchange for local currency—no red tape, no secret fees. That’s in contrast to meme coins, whose value swings wildly based on social media opinion. With Remittix, users get actual cost savings and faster transactions, a big draw for businesses and freelancers. The intuitive dashboard makes every transaction into straightforward steps that anyone can follow so that new users can operate the platform without having to understand complex blockchain. If this can be done all over the world, Remittix can be a go-to option for cross-border transactions—a niche most expect to be taken over by tokens like XRP or SOL. With a real-world application, Remittix has overcome market skepticism, even surpassing meme coins that are currently popular in recent times. Meme Coins versus Utility Tokens: Can Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Match Remittix’s Real-World Effectiveness? Meme tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are still near the heart of crypto culture, fueled by passionate communities and meme-worthy events. Yet Remittix’s quick appreciation demonstrates how utility-focused projects can appeal to investors seeking something greater than short-term pumps. Even as the potential for a US Crypto Reserve teeters in the air—maybe to the benefit of XRP, SOL, and ADA—traders are still drawn to meme tokens because of their high-risk, high-reward potential. Whether Dogecoin or Shiba Inu will be able to duplicate a significant rally is a matter of present network innovation, celebrity endorsement, or overall market sentiment. Meanwhile, Remittix quietly advances by solving real-world remittance problems, creating a niche in a rapidly changing crypto environment. The next couple of months will determine whether meme coins will be able to keep dominating or if rational platforms will be leading the next wave of adoption. Take a glance at the Remittix presale to understand how PayFi can revolutionize cross-border payments, while Shiba Inu and Dogecoin fight for meme coin dominance. If Remittix continues on its current path, it could be the next hit story in a market that is known to be turned upside down in one night.

The agency started Trump’s presidency with almost 100K employees, but nearly 7K have been laid off since February 20th. Small business Tax professional and co-founder of The Collaboration Room Mike Sylvester said it was ‘an utterly awful idea’ that could potentially ‘jeopardize’ the agency’s tax collection services. Employees who recently joined the agency without job protections were mostly affected by the layoffs; the rest took Musk’s offer to resign. ‘Losing half of its employees would severely strap the I.R.S., meaning Americans may have to wait longer to receive tax refunds,’ noted the New York Times. The cuts, including normal retirements, are part of the Trump administration’s goal of halving the IRS workforce and all the other agencies across the government. The IRS has not yet specified how quickly the next terminations could take place or how they will affect each department. IRS officials have reportedly delayed some ‘firings’ until spring when the busy period will end. The agency is in the middle of reviewing the U.S. citizens’ tax returns during this year’s ‘annual filing season’. Losing half of its staff presents a tough challenge for the IRS Apparently the IRS has been directed to come up with a plan to reduce their workforce to 45,000. This is cutting it in half during a time when 90,000 is not enough due to the 50 year old technology the IRS has been saddled with. As a tax professional, this is an utterly awful… — Mike Sylvester, CPA (@FortWayneCPA) March 5, 2025 The IRS has reportedly struggled for years with hiring and retaining employees that could process millions of tax returns every year and conduct complex audits. However, the agency was directed to come up with a plan to reduce their workforce to 45,000. U.S. citizens may soon have to wait longer to receive refunds or speak with I.R.S. employees in future filing seasons. Corporations and wealthy Americans may also face less scrutiny from the understaffed tax agency. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) led by Gavin Kliger and Sam Corcos working from its Washington headquarters, has reportedly taken a keen interest in the IRS in recent weeks in connection with Musk’s cost-cutting effort. D.O.G.E continues to push for access to the IRS databases, which include the most recent records with information about the agency’s contractors. “This is cutting the IRS in half during a time when 90,000 is not enough due to the 50 year old technology it has been saddled with” – Mike Sylvester IRS leadership has been in ‘turmoil’ since the layoffs began and two leaders have already stepped down under President Trump. Melanie Krause, the current acting commissioner at the IRS, reportedly put the chief human capital officer at the I.R.S. on administrative leave this week. IRS ‘disproportionately’ harms enforcement efforts Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said on a Thursday call with reporters that the IRS layoffs would disproportionately harm enforcement efforts. According to the latest IRS data, the IRS employs roughly 90K workers across the United States. People of color account for nearly 56% of the IRS workforce, and women represent about 65%. The layoffs likely meant the end of ‘the agency’s plan to go after super-rich tax dodgers and could spell disaster for revenue collections’. The majority of the employees shown the door at the IRS so far were newly hired workers focused on compliance, which includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code and paying delinquent debts, among other duties. A union representing Treasury Department employees warned on Thursday that the IRS layoffs were one of the largest purges of probationary workers across the government this year, and it could hurt customer service and tax return processing during tax season . Former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and six other former commissioners strongly opposed the planned downsizing, also warning that it could severely impact the agency’s ability to function. However, employees directly involved in the 2025 tax returns season have allegedly been barred from accepting Musk’s buyouts until after the April tax filing deadline in mid-May. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem formally requested IRS personnel in February to reassign some IRS employees to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assist with immigration enforcement.

If momentum persists, Solana could reclaim key resistance levels and reassert itself as one of the top-performing assets of this cycle. Meanwhile, Rollblock is revolutionising blockchain gaming by merging traditional casino experiences with Web3 technology in its play-to-earn ecosystem. As the iGaming industry rapidly expands, RBLK is positioning itself as a top contender, with the potential to skyrocket in value much like other breakout gaming tokens in 2021. Why Rollblock Could Become The Next Big Gaming Giant Rollblock is reshaping blockchain gaming, bringing next-level innovation to a rapidly expanding industry. With over 7,000 games ranging from traditional casino classics to cutting-edge blockchain exclusives, the platform delivers a rich and engaging gaming experience tailored to a global audience. Sports betting has further enhanced Rollblock’s ecosystem, adding another layer of entertainment and accessibility. With nearly $11 million secured in its tenth presale stage and a fast-growing community of 50,000+ members, Rollblock is establishing itself as a premier player in iGaming and blockchain-based entertainment. The RBLK token is central to Rollblock’s long-term sustainability, driving engagement and rewarding users. Up to 30% of platform revenue funds strategic buybacks, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned to create scarcity and 40% distributed as staking rewards, reinforcing value appreciation. Rollblock prioritizes security and compliance, operating with an Anjouan Gaming license and undergoing a rigorous SolidProof audit. Equipped with AI-powered fraud detection and advanced encryption, the platform ensures a safe, transparent, and fair gaming environment for all users. Here’s The Rundown On Solana Following The US Crypto Reserve News Solana has remained a dominant force in the market, benefiting from strong institutional interest and its growing role as a retail haven in the crypto ecosystem. However, recent setbacks, including the Libra meme coin scandal and an impending 11 million Solana token unlock, have raised some concerns despite wider bullish news. Adding to market speculation, CME Group has announced the launch of Solana futures , indicating further institutional interest. This move could pave the way for a spot Solana ETF, with firms like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pushing for regulatory approval. If approved, this would solidify Solana’s position as an elite cryptocurrency alongside Ethereum. Investor sentiment remains mixed, however, with some traders fearing further downside if Solana loses key support at $130. For instance, crypto trader Ali Martinez has warned that Solana breaking below this level could trigger a 52% drop to $65 . Despite recent volatility, Solana’s long-term prospects remain promising. Solana continues to be the leading blockchain for meme coins and decentralized applications, attracting both high-risk traders and serious developers simultaneously. With regulatory developments on the horizon, Solana could easily emerge as one of the top-performing assets in this bull cycle. Don’t Miss Out On The Limited Window To Accumulate RBLK During The Presale! With the 4-year cycle analysis pointing to a major altcoin surge by the end of February, now is the time to position for maximum gains.

The publicly listed company, already known for its proactive Bitcoin strategy, just announced a significant addition to its treasury. Buckle up as we dive into how Metaplanet is doubling down on Bitcoin, acquiring a whopping 497 BTC and solidifying its position as a corporate Bitcoin champion. What does this mean for the future of corporate Bitcoin investment and the broader crypto landscape? Metaplanet’s Bold Move: Adding 497 BTC to its Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet’s latest announcement sent ripples through the financial markets as they revealed the purchase of another 497 Bitcoin. This substantial acquisition isn’t just a minor top-up; it’s a powerful statement of belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Let’s break down the key details: Significant Purchase: Metaplanet has acquired 497 BTC, adding considerably to their already substantial BTC holdings . Growing Treasury: With this latest purchase, Metaplanet now holds a total of 2,888 BTC. This makes them one of the most prominent publicly listed companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Public Announcement: The news was shared via X, highlighting the company’s transparency and engagement with the crypto community. This move begs the question: Why is Metaplanet so aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, and what are the potential benefits for the company and its investors? Why Bitcoin Investment is at the Heart of Metaplanet’s Strategy Metaplanet’s dedication to Bitcoin isn’t a fleeting trend; it’s a core element of their corporate strategy. But why are they so bullish on Bitcoin? Here are a few compelling reasons: Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and traditional economic downturns. In a world of fluctuating currencies and economic instability, Bitcoin offers a decentralized and limited-supply asset. Long-Term Value Proposition: Metaplanet likely views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. They are not just trading Bitcoin; they are accumulating it, indicating a belief in its appreciating value over time. Diversification and Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin diversifies Metaplanet’s treasury beyond traditional assets, positioning them as an innovative and forward-thinking company in the eyes of investors. Potential for Higher Returns: Compared to traditional low-yield assets, Bitcoin offers the potential for significantly higher returns, although with increased volatility. This strategic Bitcoin investment aligns Metaplanet with a growing number of companies recognizing the potential of digital assets. But what makes Japan such an interesting location for a company leading the charge in corporate Bitcoin adoption? Japan : A Crypto-Friendly Hub for Innovation Japan has long been recognized as a forward-thinking nation when it comes to technology and finance. Here’s why Japan ‘s regulatory environment and technological landscape make it fertile ground for companies like Metaplanet to thrive with their corporate Bitcoin strategy : Progressive Regulations: Japan has established relatively clear and progressive regulations for cryptocurrencies, providing a degree of legal certainty that encourages innovation and investment in the crypto space. Tech-Savvy Population: Japan boasts a highly tech-savvy population with a strong understanding and adoption of digital technologies, including cryptocurrencies. Financial Innovation Hub: Japan is a major global financial center, fostering an environment conducive to financial innovation and the integration of new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Government Support for Blockchain: The Japanese government has shown support for blockchain technology and its applications, which indirectly benefits companies operating in the cryptocurrency sector. With Japan as its base, Metaplanet is strategically positioned to leverage the country’s crypto-friendly environment to further its corporate Bitcoin strategy . But how does Metaplanet’s BTC holdings compare to other companies, and what are the broader implications of this trend? Analyzing Metaplanet’s BTC Holdings and the Corporate Bitcoin Trend Metaplanet’s BTC holdings are not just a number; they represent a significant shift in corporate treasury management. Let’s put their holdings into perspective and explore the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin strategy : Company Estimated BTC Holdings Strategy MicroStrategy ~214,000+ BTC Primary Treasury Reserve Asset Metaplanet 2,888 BTC Treasury Diversification and Growth Tesla ~9,720 BTC (estimated) Diversification, Payments (Previously) Block, Inc. ~8,038 BTC Treasury Reserve and Ecosystem Support As you can see, while MicroStrategy remains the leader in corporate Bitcoin strategy , Metaplanet’s BTC holdings are substantial and growing. This trend signals a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. What are the potential benefits and challenges for companies adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy ? Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Embracing a corporate Bitcoin strategy comes with both exciting opportunities and significant considerations. Let’s weigh the pros and cons: Benefits: Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin’s potential for price appreciation can significantly boost corporate treasury returns, especially in a low-interest-rate environment. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation, preserving the real value of corporate assets over time. Brand Innovation: Adopting Bitcoin can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, attracting investors and customers who value technological advancement. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin offers a decentralized and secure alternative to traditional financial systems, reducing reliance on intermediaries. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can lead to significant fluctuations in the value of corporate holdings, requiring robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty: While Japan is progressive, regulatory landscapes for cryptocurrencies vary globally and are constantly evolving, posing potential compliance challenges. Accounting and Tax Complexity: Accounting for and taxing Bitcoin holdings can be complex and requires specialized expertise. Security Risks: Safeguarding large BTC holdings requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Despite these challenges, Metaplanet’s continued Bitcoin investment underscores their belief that the benefits outweigh the risks in the long run. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Right for Your Corporate Treasury? Inspired by Metaplanet’s corporate Bitcoin strategy and wondering if Bitcoin is right for your company’s treasury? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Conduct Thorough Research: Understand Bitcoin, its underlying technology, and its market dynamics. Educate your team about the risks and rewards. Assess Risk Tolerance: Evaluate your company’s risk tolerance and financial stability. Bitcoin investments should align with your overall financial strategy. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives for Bitcoin investment . Are you looking for a hedge, long-term growth, or diversification? Implement Robust Security: If you decide to invest, prioritize security. Use cold storage solutions and implement best practices for digital asset management. Stay Informed and Adapt: The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about regulatory changes and market trends, and be prepared to adapt your strategy as needed. Conclusion: Metaplanet Leads the Charge in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 497 BTC is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a resounding endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic corporate asset. As they boldly expand their BTC holdings , Metaplanet is setting a precedent for other companies to consider the potential of corporate Bitcoin strategy . While challenges remain, the potential rewards of Bitcoin investment , including enhanced returns, inflation hedging, and brand innovation, are increasingly compelling.

In a series of recent developments, the White House has announced its support for congressional efforts to overturn an IRS rule targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, while also preparing to host a high-profile crypto summit. The summit, set to take place in Washington, DC, will bring together key industry leaders, including executives from Coinbase, Kraken, and Chainlink, to discuss the future of digital assets in the US. Trump Administration Backs Effort to Rescind IRS DeFi Broker Rule The White House has announced its support for congressional efforts to overturn the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that classifies decentralized finance (DeFi) software providers as brokers. The move, championed by AI and crypto czar David Sacks, signals the Trump administration’s commitment to fostering innovation in the digital asset space while pushing back against regulatory measures deemed restrictive to the industry. In a March 4 post on X, Sacks expressed the administration’s support for resolutions led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Representative Mike Carey under the Congressional Review Act. These resolutions seek to repeal an IRS rule that expands the definition of a “broker” to include software providers facilitating access to DeFi protocols. Sacks noted that senior advisers to President Donald Trump would recommend signing the joint resolution, S.J. Res. 3, into law should it reach the president’s desk. “This rule, issued as a midnight regulation in the final days of the previous Administration, would stifle American innovation and raise privacy concerns over the sharing of taxpayers’ personal information, while imposing an unprecedented compliance burden on American DeFi companies,” read a statement from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on March 4. The IRS rule, introduced in December 2024 before Trump took office, was met with swift opposition from the crypto industry. Critics argue that the policy, set to be implemented in 2027, could drive companies offshore and hinder innovation within the DeFi sector. Under the IRS framework, a DeFi platform facilitating digital asset exchanges and exerting influence over transactions could be classified as a broker. This classification would subject such entities to rigorous reporting obligations. The IRS estimates that between 650 and 875 DeFi brokers would need to start collecting and reporting user data beginning in 2026. Crypto advocacy groups, lawmakers, and industry leaders have criticized the policy as overly broad and inconsistent with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. They argue that forcing DeFi platforms to comply with broker regulations contradicts the fundamental principles of decentralization and financial autonomy. Trump Administration’s Crypto-Friendly Stance Since assuming office in January, the Trump administration has taken a proactive stance toward digital assets. With Republicans controlling both the Senate and House of Representatives, several crypto-friendly legislative proposals have emerged. Trump has already signed multiple executive orders aimed at supporting the industry and reducing regulatory burdens. The push to rescind the IRS DeFi broker rule represents a broader shift in regulatory approach under the current administration. By supporting resolutions to overturn restrictive measures, the White House signals its willingness to work with the crypto sector to create policies that promote growth while addressing concerns around compliance and oversight. While the fate of the IRS rule now lies with Congress, industry leaders remain optimistic that the Trump administration’s support will lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. Trump to Host Crypto Summit with Industry Leaders at White House In related news, the White House is set to host a highly anticipated crypto summit, bringing together some of the most influential figures in the digital asset industry. President Donald Trump will personally address the gathering, which will include top executives from leading crypto firms such as Coinbase, Kraken, Chainlink, and Paradigm. The summit shows the administration’s growing commitment to making the United States a global leader in the cryptocurrency space. Among the high-profile attendees confirmed for the event are Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, and Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. A spokesperson for Chainlink verified Nazarov’s attendance, while representatives from Coinbase and Kraken also confirmed Armstrong and Sethi’s participation. In addition, Strategy founder Michael Saylor, Exodus CEO JP Richardson, and Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang are slated to attend, according to announcements made on X on Tuesday. “I look forward to discussing how America can take a leadership role in promoting the principles of open crypto and enabling builders in ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana,” Huang stated. The summit, chaired by AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, will be directed by Bo Hines, who leads Trump’s working group on digital assets. The event is scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. ET, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Trump administration’s recent pro-crypto stance marks a significant shift from previous regulatory approaches. Over the past few weeks, the president has made several statements indicating that his administration aims to position the US as the “crypto capital.” One key topic expected to be discussed at the summit is Trump’s proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve , a working group initiative designed to establish a digital asset reserve comprising “US-based coins.” This would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select altcoins such as Solana, Cardano, and XRP. While Trump’s proposal has been met with enthusiasm in some circles, critics have questioned the inclusion of certain altcoins, arguing that Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain higher decentralization and developer activity. Regulatory Changes and the SEC’s Retreat The timing of the summit coincides with sweeping changes at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Since former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s departure in January, the regulatory landscape has shifted notably. The agency has dropped lawsuits against several major crypto firms, including Kraken, Consensys, and Coinbase, and has ended probes into companies such as Gemini and Yuga Labs. On Tuesday, market maker Cumberland DRW confirmed that the SEC had agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against the firm, marking yet another significant legal victory for the crypto industry. These developments suggest a regulatory thawing, which could pave the way for greater institutional adoption and innovation in the sector. The White House’s move to host a crypto summit is widely seen as an attempt to align US policy with the interests of blockchain innovators and investors. In a statement on Saturday, the administration emphasized its commitment to fostering a more welcoming regulatory environment for digital assets. “After the previous administration unfairly prosecuted the digital asset space, President Trump’s policy vision represents a new era for digital financial technology,” the statement read. With major industry leaders gathering in Washington, the crypto community is watching closely to see whether this summit will lay the foundation for new policies that could solidify the US’s role as a global crypto hub.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|LINK|TECHNOLOGY|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-05 06:00:00

Scheduled for this Friday, March 7, the attendee list, however, remains unexpectedly exclusive and relatively small, with only roughly 20 to 25 invitees reportedly taking part. According to newly shared information by FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, details are still in flux, but several high-profile industry participants have confirmed their attendance. Here’s Who Attentending Trump’s Crypto Summit She attributed this to the roundtable format and the participation of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, which reportedly includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Attorney General Pam Bondi, the SEC Chair, and the CFTC Chair, Crypto Czar David Sacks and Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets of the White House. “A larger, invite-only reception is being planned across the street from the White House for those not invited to the roundtable meeting,” she added. Terrett also provided a series of updates, confirming multiple attendees. Among them are Michael Saylor, Bitcoin Inc CEO David Bailey, Paradigm founder Matt Huang, Exodus CEO JP Richardson, Multicoin Capital co-founder Kyle Samani, and Zach Witkoff of World Liberty Finance . Additional confirmations include Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. Terrett also noted: “A little more detail here — invites were sent to attendees via email this afternoon. Per the email, the event is scheduled to go from 1:30PM – 5:30PM. No further details in the missive beyond time and location.” Several of the confirmed attendees have already spoken publicly about the summit. Michael Saylor posted on X: “I have been invited to the Digital Assets Summit at the White House this Friday, hosted by the President.” Multicoin’s Kyle Samani wrote: “I’ll be attending The Digital Assets Summit on Friday, March 7th at the White House. I look forward to collaborating with industry peers, the Trump administration, and elected officials to ensure crypto thrives in America. Thank you to President Trump for this wonderful opportunity!” Paradigm founder Matt Huang expressed enthusiasm: “I’ll be attending the White House Digital Asset Summit on Friday. Thank you to President Trump for the invitation. I look forward to discussing how America can take a leadership role in promoting the principles of open crypto and enabling builders in ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.” Notably absent from the list of confirmed attendees is Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse . Earlier in the week, Garlinghouse wrote on X: “I’ve said this before – the crypto industry will achieve our goals (and beyond), IF WE WORK TOGETHER. Appreciate the crypto President Donald Trump’s vision of a govt digital asset reserve representative of the industry. I will certainly continue to champion this while in Washington at the end of this week.” So far, however, Garlinghouse has not confirmed whether he received an invitation to Friday’s summit. Similarly, no confirmation has emerged regarding representatives from the Solana or Cardano ecosystems, despite President Trump’s recent Truth Social announcement of establishing a crypto strategic reserve holding five cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko have also remained silent on any attendance.

The latest in a series of progressive moves Ethena Labs has made regarding USDe involves Bybit, one of the largest exchanges in the industry right now. According to a tweet from Bybit, the exchange’s users can now mint, redeem, and earn USDe on Bybit On-chain earn, an ongoing campaign. Ethena Labs also shared a tweet to commemorate the partnership, explaining that the new development allows Bybit users to mint and redeem USDe natively without leaving the platform.

This is expected to help support deeper liquidity on the exchange. According to Ethena Labs, “this feature perfectly complements Bybit USDe holders’ ability to earn rewards for holding USDe as well as using it as derivatives margin collateral.” The tweet ended with Ethena Labs highlighting how committed it and Bybit are to creating innovative user experiences and further improving users’ capital efficiency.

Source: Ethena Labs With the Bybit integration, USDe gains a larger user base, making it an even bigger contender in the stablecoin race, which is getting more serious as the crypto industry hedges closer to mass adoption. Aside from the partnership with Bybit, Ethena’s USDe has also been enjoying recent popularity in the industry as several other entities seem bullish on it. Last month, MEXC cryptocurrency exchange invested in Ethena as part of a broader push to promote stablecoin development and adoption. MEXC made the announcement on February 26, claiming it allocated $20 million to Ethena’s synthetic US dollar, USDe, and $16 million to developer Ethena Labs. Like Bybit, the exchange also launched a $1 million reward pool to encourage participation in USDe trading and staking. It is not hard to see why MEXC made such a huge commitment. The exchange’s chief operating officer, Tracy Jin, believes stablecoins have a “pivotal role” to play in promoting cryptocurrency usage and adoption. USDe has a circulating supply of nearly $5.4 billion, making it the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. More good news for Ethena Labs’ USDe MEXC’s investment followed Ethena reportedly closing a $100-million funding round backed by major investors, including the famed Franklin Templeton. According to a Bloomberg report, the fundraising was financed via a private sale of Ethena’s governance token, ENA and the funds will be used to build a blockchain and token for the traditional finance industry. According to Ethena Labs’ founder, Guy Young in a January blog post, Ethena has plans to deploy iUSDe, a token with the sole purpose of regulating financial institutions. This token differs from USDe in that it is designed to “export” the benefits of USDe to traditional finance institutions. In short, its purpose is to bridge crypto yields with regulated financial markets. iUSDe shares the same delta-neutral stability mechanism as USDe which means it maintains its peg by collateralizing stablecoins and taking futures positions with large open interest. However, it also includes “transfer restrictions” to comply with TradFi regulatory requirements. It is essentially a wrapped version of sUSDe created specifically for institutional use. So, while USDe is available for regular users, iUSDe will be restricted to approved institutional players via partnerships with TradFi distribution channels. As far as yield is concerned, it will offer a similar yield to sUSDe, which is around 10-20%. However, it’s being touted as a “savings token” for institutions to access without direct blockchain exposure. Ethena Labs is in the stablecoin competition Ethena Labs’ USDe stands out from other stablecoins, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC because it uses a hedging strategy collateralized by cryptocurrencies. USDe holders are also offered a 9% yield by Ethena Labs. Despite the largest exchange hack in history occurring in the last week, the weekly distribution for sUSDe has been finalised at ~9% APY sUSDe: ~9% sUSDS: ~7% aUSDC: ~5% aUSDT: ~4% BFUSD: ~3% Just use Ethena https://t.co/GiGIdkvGv3 pic.twitter.com/7MxsCLXIsW — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) February 27, 2025 Some experts see USDe as a potential safe haven during periods of great volatility in the wider crypto market. One of them is Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer of Maelstrom. In fact, Hayes likes it so much, he has revealed that his digital asset fund has raised its exposure to USDe “to record levels.” USDe is already popular, but now that yield-bearing stablecoins appear to be gaining ground, it is expected to become even more attractive. Back in February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security from Figure Markets. The forthcoming YLDS stablecoin will allow users to earn interest payments on their holdings and experts think it signals the regulator’s intent to accommodate the rapidly growing stablecoin market. According to Figure Markets CEO Mike Cagney the application was submitted to the SEC more than one year ago. However it was most likely not taken seriously by the previous SEC administration as it eliminates the need for traditional finance. “If I can hold this [stablecoin], if I can self-custody this, if it pays me interest, and I can actually use it to transact, what do I need a bank for?” Cagney said.

The decline came after a wave of profit-taking, following initial optimism around President Trump’s U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement on Mar. 2. Solana ( SOL ) surged to $179, before plummeting to $130 as the market reacted to Trump’s confirmation that tariffs on Canada and Mexico will take effect on Mar. 4. Despite the volatility, Solana’s DEX sector remains strong. According to DeFiLlama data , Solana topped DEX volume for the fifth consecutive month, hitting $109 billion, which was 24% higher than Ethereum ( ETH ). Even though the memecoin trading market has cooled , platforms like Raydium ( RAY ), Meteora, and Orca are still driving huge trading volumes. On the technical front, the 9-day EMA is acting as resistance, indicating bearish momentum. Support is located at $136, while key resistance levels are at $150.05, $166.32, and $179.01. At 39.65, just above oversold zone, the relative strength index indicates the possibility of a brief recovery. Solana technical analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although there has been a spike in trading activity recently, the overall trend is still downward. SOL may try to recover toward $166 if it breaks above the $150 level. However, it could drop further if current support is not maintained. You might also like: Solana loses over $5 billion in TVL since all-time high, will SOL recover?

Ripple’s long-running battle with the SEC might finally be nearing its end. Rumors of an imminent dismissal or settlement have sparked a buying frenzy, pushing XRP up over 23% in the past 24 hours. Some analysts even believe a resolution could send it soaring over the $20 mark. While XRP dominates headlines, StratoVM (SVM) could make its own mark in the BTCFi sector. Its dedicated Layer-2 solution has pushed an impressive 6240% price surge in just 14 days, defying the recent red trend. Let’s check out the details! Ripple XRP News: Could Drop of SEC Lawsuit Triggering a XRP Rally to $20? Traders are turning bullish as the SEC acknowledges more spot XRP ETF filings, fueling hopes for regulatory progress. XRP has jumped over 15% since closing at $2.32 on Feb. 6, driven by excitement over CoinShares’ ETF application via Nasdaq. This is the fourth spot XRP ETF to get an initial nod, following filings from Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Brazil’s securities commission approved the country’s first spot XRP ETF from Hashdex, though it’s not trading yet. Despite the rally, XRP futures traders are still hesitant – open interest dropped over 78% last week after XRP fell 26% in early February. Even with a 20% price rebound, OI has only climbed by $600 million after losing nearly $4 billion. This suggests lower trading volume is pushing the rally, making it more vulnerable to volatility. Analyst Amonyx predicts the SEC-Ripple lawsuit will be settled soon, triggering a “god candle” that could send XRP to $20 within 10 days. If legal clarity combines with ETF momentum, XRP might finally break out in a big way. StratoVM (SVM) Could Capture a Large Share of the BTCFi Market StratoVM (SVM) is developing a Layer 2 blockchain on Bitcoin that might enable smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi apps directly on the Bitcoin network. CoinGecko shows StratoVM trading at around $0.173, which represents a 6240% increase in just two weeks. This surge might show its strength during market ups and downs, possibly because it could help solve Bitcoin’s scaling issues. The team plans to launch their mainnet soon, which could mark a big step forward. Compared to other Bitcoin Layer 2 projects like CoreDAO (valued at roughly $990M), StratoVM sits at $2 million suggesting room for future growth. DefiLlama reports that BTCFi protocols have grown from about $307 million in January 2024 to roughly $6.6 billion in February 2025. StratoVM might tap into this with its approach to Bitcoin scaling. The project’s listing on UniSwap could boost its credibility as something worth watching more closely. StratoVM has built a network of over 50 strategic partners, which might help drive future growth and innovation. Some reports suggest a possible listing on a centralized exchange (CEX), which could be good news for the project. The community seems interested, with nearly 100,000 followers across its official X , Telegram , and Discord channels. The testnet shows amazing early results, supporting over 113,000 registered wallets and processing more than 56,000 daily transactions. As Bitcoin grows beyond just “digital gold,” StratoVM’s scaling and security features might help it capture part of the growing BTCFi market. With the mainnet launch just around the corner and these features in place, SVM might secure additional exchange listings after its official debut. Final Thoughts If the SEC settles with Ripple, XRP could finally break free from legal uncertainty and push toward the $20 milestone. With ETF buzz growing and speculation heating up, all eyes are on its next move. While XRP grabs headlines, StratoVM (SVM) could bring innovation in the BTCFi field. StratoVM grew 6240% in just 14 days, attracting liquidity and developer interest. This article is not financial advice.

With the ETH price and the price of Solana poised to see some gains soon, many investors are keeping an eye on them. With the recent US crypto reverse announcement, both these tokens may surge quickly. Even market experts like Crypto Rover and Ray have made bold price predictions for these top crypto coins. IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making headlines with its great crypto ICO event performance. This presale star, now in phase ten, has already rewarded early buyers with a 911% return. But a Tier-1 CEX listing is coming soon, which will bring another massive rally. Not only that, but IntelMarkets will also bring the future of crypto trading using AI technology, making it a powerful force in this space. Thus, it could even have a higher upside than ETH and SOL. IntelMarkets (INTL) Stuns Traders With a 911% Return With the ETH price and the price of Solana potentially soaring, IntelMarkets (INTL) is making waves, too. This presale has raised over $11M so far and could hit $13M before this month ends. Investors who got in early are now 911% richer—a percentage that will rise soon as the eleventh phase of the crypto ICO event starts and a Tier-1 CEX listing comes. The INTL token will power the IntelMarkets trading platform. This platform is also making headlines as it aims to use AI tech to stand out from peers like Coinbase. On IntelMarkets, users will get access to self-learning trading robots that do not make the same mistake twice and the Intell-M® channel analysis tool, which provides consolidated insights from over 10K data platforms. Thus, countless traders are waiting for the launch of IntelMarkets. INTL costs just $0.091 but this value will hit $0.10 after phase eleven of its presale begins. Also, a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap will trigger a rally to $0.11. In other words, those who buy this crypto coin now will get a 20% return. This growth could pale in comparison to what INTL may see if it follows the same trajectory as other promising exchange tokens like BNB did. The ETH Price Will Explode Soon, Analyst Claims Ethereum (ETH) is one of the best cryptos, but it has faced some turbulence recently. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has dropped from around $3,000 to nearly $2,000 in the past 30 days. In other words, the ETH price has fallen over 30% in just a few short weeks. However, market expert Crypto Rover remains bullish for Ethereum (ETH). According to his X post, the bottom is in, and the ETH price may skyrocket soon. He even says that the ETH price will explode like Bitcoin’s. This Ethereum price prediction has made some waves, but many traders are still skeptical. This is because its high market cap of around $250B means a lot of new money needs to roll in for the ETH price to soar. As a result, traders are choosing to focus on INTL instead. Ray: The Price of Solana (SOL) May Hit $1,000 Although one of the top 10 altcoins, Solana (SOL) has also shown red price charts. In the past 30 days, the price of Solana fell over 35% as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value dropped from around $210 to nearly $130. The community is watching Solana (SOL) thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Ray. In a recent X post, Ray said that the price of Solana could reach $1,000 soon. This Solana price prediction has turned many heads in the market. Nevertheless, many investors are skeptical about this price of Solana movement prediction. This is because its high market cap of around $70B. As the price of Solana may see slower gains, a lot of traders are looking at INTL as an alternative. IntelMarkets (INTL) vs. Ethereum (ETH) vs. Solana (SOL) – Which Crypto Coin Stands Out? IntelMarkets (INTL), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) could all see big price gains in 2025. But, a lot more eyes are set on IntelMarkets. This project introduces groundbreaking technology that taps into the growing AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. As a result, its long-term growth potential and stability may be better. Additionally, the smaller market cap of INTL means faster price gains while the price of Solana and the ETH price could see slower growth. Due to all these factors, investors look at INTL as the best crypto investment for fast returns this year.

BTFD Coin’s Presale and Explosive 3,650% ROI Projection Say It’s Time to Get In",https://thecoinrise.com/watched-brett-hit-0-235-btfd-coins-presale-and-explosive-3650-roi-projection-say-its-time-to-get-in/,"Meme coins have become a goldmine for early investors, turning small bets into life-changing profits overnight. Brett ($BRETT), the official mascot of Base Chain, took off in spectacular fashion, soaring to an all-time high of $0.235 just three months ago. Many traders who sat on the sidelines watched in disbelief as early holders cashed in big, proving once again that catching the right meme coin at the right time is the key to serious gains. Now, with Brett’s momentum shifting and new opportunities emerging, all eyes are on BTFD Coin. With a $6.25 million presale tally, over 71 billion tokens sold, and a projected moon price of $0.006, BTFD is shaping up to be the next meme coin explosion. As one of the top cryptos to join for short term , it offers investors a golden opportunity to get in early before the hype fully takes off. Those who regret missing Brett’s breakout have a chance to redeem themselves, but they’ll have to act fast—Stage 14 is live, and this price won’t stay for long. BTFD Coin—The Next Meme Coin to Watch BTFD Coin is more than just hype; it’s got the numbers and the momentum to back it up. Its presale has already raised over $6.25 million, with a rapidly growing investor base of over 11,200 Bulls. Analysts are buzzing about its potential, predicting a massive 3,650% ROI once it hits the projected post-launch price of $0.006. Unlike Brett, which many only discovered after its major run-up, BTFD Coin is still in its early stage, giving investors a rare second chance at catching a winner before it skyrockets. To put things into perspective, let’s say you invest $15,000 in BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016. Once it lists at $0.0006, that investment could turn into $56,250. And if the moon price projection of $0.006 holds? You’re looking at over $562,500—the kind of gains that could fund a brand-new car, a luxury vacation, or even set you up for early retirement. With numbers like these, it’s no surprise that BTFD Coin is being recognized as one of the top cryptos to join for short term, offering investors a prime chance to capitalize before the real surge begins. The opportunity is here, but like every meme coin rally, it won’t wait forever. BTFD isn’t just about speculation—it has real incentives driving its growth. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, launched on January 1, 2025, lets users earn rewards in $BTFD, adding a fresh utility layer that most meme coins lack. On top of that, staking rewards offer a jaw-dropping 90% APY, making it one of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in crypto right now. The Bulls Squad community is thriving, bringing together thousands of investors who recognize the best new opportunities in meme coins with 100x potential before the mainstream catches on. Getting in on BTFD’s presale is as simple as setting up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, funding it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and connecting your wallet to the presale page to purchase tokens before the presale ends. Over 71 billion tokens have already been claimed, and with each stage pushing the price higher, waiting too long could mean paying more later. Brett Exploded to $0.235—Will It Happen Again? Brett made a name for itself as the official mascot of Base Chain, drawing inspiration from Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comics. It capitalized on the growing hype surrounding meme coins, riding the wave of Base Chain’s popularity to reach its all-time high of $0.235. Investors who got in early watched their holdings multiply in value, proving once again that meme coins can generate insane profits when they catch fire. But as with any meme coin, timing is everything. The real money is made by those who buy before the hype peaks. Brett’s price action has cooled since its ATH, and while it remains a strong player in the Base Chain ecosystem, the biggest gains often come from spotting the next breakout star before the rest of the market catches on. That’s exactly where BTFD Coin comes into play. Looking at the patterns in meme coin history, it’s clear that early-stage investments bring the highest returns. Brett rewarded its early adopters, but now BTFD Coin is sitting at a low presale entry point with the potential for a massive rally post-launch. Those who missed Brett’s climb to $0.235 don’t have to sit out on another moonshot—BTFD Coin’s presale is still open, but not for long. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin has all the elements of a high-reward, early-stage investment. Its presale numbers speak for themselves, with over $6.25 million raised, 71 billion tokens sold, and a community of more than 11,200 Bulls backing its success. With a projected listing price of $0.0006 and a moon price target of $0.006, investors have a clear path to 3,650% ROI potential. The biggest regret in crypto isn’t the coins you sell too early—it’s the ones you never buy at all. Brett reached $0.235, and many watched from the sidelines as it happened. This is the chance to avoid making the same mistake twice. As one of the top cryptos to join for short term, BTFD Coin is gearing up for its biggest run yet, and the investors who act now will be the ones celebrating when it hits new all-time highs. Join BTFD Coin’s presale before it’s too late. FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the top cryptos to join for short term? BTFD Coin’s explosive presale, 3,650% ROI potential, staking rewards, Play-to-Earn game, and strong community backing make it a major contender in the meme coin space. How does BTFD Coin compare to Brett’s run to $0.235? Brett’s rally proved the power of meme coins, but BTFD Coin is still in presale mode, meaning investors can enter at a much lower price with the potential for bigger gains post-launch. How can I buy BTFD Coin before the presale ends? Buying BTFD is easy. Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, connect to the presale page, and purchase BTFD tokens before the price goes up.

41178515,https://nulltx.com/?p=146525,1741158959,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Dogecoin’s 2021 Chart Mirrored in DTX Exchange, But Can This Presale Star Surpass DOGE’s ATH by Q2?",https://nulltx.com/dogecoins-2021-chart-mirrored-in-dtx-exchange-but-can-this-presale-star-surpass-doges-ath-by-q2/,"2021 marked a historic rally for meme coins with the Dogecoin price soaring to great heights thanks to social media and viral buzz, but a new challenger is following an identical path. DTX Exchange, a new concept in DeFi and TradFi, is moving forward similarly to DOGE in its initial months of skyrocketing. However, analysts wonder if DTX can exceed DOGE’s ATH throughout the market. Read on to find out more. DTX Exchange Gains Momentum Among Retail and Institutional Investors The Dogecoin price volatility has pulled investors toward more stable and high-growth opportunities like DTX Exchange . The platform aims to unite stocks, bonds, ETFs, options, forex, crypto, and commodities in a new hybrid trading environment to give traders a diversified financial environment. VulcanX, a Layer-1 blockchain designed for speed and efficiency, is at the heart of its innovation. It can process more than 200,000 transactions a second (TPS) and ensures trade execution without congestion and delays, a problem that has bedeviled centralized and decentralized exchanges. With speed no longer a problem, traders can concentrate on profiting without network slowdowns. DTX Exchange is unique in integrating with different blockchain protocols, creating liquidity pools and cross-chain asset trading. Deep liquidity access opens up more market opportunities for traders while preserving asset liquidity so they can be traded across ecosystems. Unlike traditional exchanges that suffer from inefficiencies, DTX is a hybrid model that combines the best of centralized platforms with decentralized finance’s transparency and user control. Traders get institutional-grade security, instant order execution, and full asset ownership. For those seeking leverage, DTX raises the bar with 1,000x trading power. A $100 position can control up to $100,000 in assets, offering a level of market exposure rarely seen elsewhere. Whether trading forex, stocks, commodities, or top altcoins, users have a unique opportunity to amplify potential gains. Beyond its trading features, DTX Exchange is introducing an automated investment manager tailored to both active and passive investors. It simplifies wealth-building while reducing market stress by allowing strategic portfolio growth through automated micro-investments and risk-adjusted allocations. Security remains a top priority, and DTX achieves this by adopting a non-custodial wallet system. Traders control their private keys, and their assets are never subjected to third-party failures. This particular self-sovereign approach matches the core ideas of blockchain technology. The DTX presale has already surpassed $15.5 million, drawing in thousands of investors eager to get in early. With the listing price set to increase soon, now is the last opportunity to secure a 100% token bonus. Investors using the code “LIST2X” at checkout will see their holdings double, effectively securing a 4x return instead of the standard 2x post-listing. This positions DTX holders for more gain than DOGE. Dogecoin Price Faces Uncertainty as Investors Shift to Other Projects The Dogecoin price has recently hiked to $0.24 before retracing to $0.21, depicting a 5.89% surge on the daily charts. The trading volume has registered a 286% surge to $3.95 billion; however, the discrepancy in network activity has raised some worries. Dogecoin’s Unspent Transaction Output, which indicates user involvement, has fallen by 89% since the end of 2023. Besides, the outgoing idling addresses, which were 2.66 million in November 2024, had been reduced to just 130,280 in February 2025, which means the number had decreased by 95%. Source: CoinMarketCap This decline suggests a waning interest in transactions and uncertainty about the sustainability of the Dogecoin price. Without a rebound of user activity, DOGE could lose its grip on the market. The bearish sentiment extended to long-term holders, who cut their positions by 2.67%, and mid-term holders, who sold off 11.81%. All these exits signal increasing volatility in the Dogecoin price and an unwillingness of investors to stick around. Technically speaking, the Dogecoin price must remain above the $0.19 support zone for the rest of the week. If DOGE breaks through key resistance levels, analysts expect a long-term target of $4, which is 1,900% above current levels. This move will take DOGE’s market cap to $575 billion, which isn’t entirely impossible. While DOGE has shown historical resistance, uncertainty has driven many holders to DTX Exchange, a hybrid trading platform that is fast gaining traction. Nonetheless, DOGE is still causing panic speculations; traders are mainly enthusiastic about those tokens with actual value and growth prospects instead. Conclusion With the continued uncertainty in the Dogecoin price, DTX Exchange is improving its leading position as the best trading platform. With the presale priced at $0.18 and the token launching at $0.36, DTX token holders can 4x their investments using the code “LIST2X” at checkout to secure massive early-stage profits. With the Dogecoin price facing uncertainty, DTX offers a more secure financial future.

41178517,https://nulltx.com/?p=146531,1741159012,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, And This Utility Coin — Which One Will Dominate Q2?",https://nulltx.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-and-this-utility-coin-which-one-will-dominate-q2/,"As the second quarter of 2025 moves closer, investors are on the lookout for the asset that will lead the next cycle. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are two top meme coins, but the question now is whether they are still worth the hype. Meanwhile, a new player is quietly rising and proving itself in its publicly available presale. DTX Exchange is showing a pathway for serious growth beyond speculation. This is because it boasts a platform with extraordinary real-world use cases. So this article takes a closer look at Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and the promising future of DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Utility Coin Gaining Traction DTX Exchange focuses on innovation and aims to remove the gap between traditional finance and blockchain. DTX gives access to a vast array of over 120,000 assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex. This is powered by the hybrid layer-1 Vulcan X blockchain, which also brings features like the Phoenix Wallet, capable of holding a diverse range of assets. This way, DTX ensures a highly efficient trading experience. And to prove its security, the platform has cleared a SolidProof audit. The project has already secured over $15.5 million during its presale phase, attracting the support of over 700,000 early investors. It is currently priced at $0.18 in its bonus presale round and its expected listing price has jumped from $0.20 to $0.36. Moreover, unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu that have high circulating supplies, DTX’s token supply is capped at 475 million tokens, adding scarcity value. With a very well-defined roadmap coupled with gradually increasing adoption, DTX Exchange now has all the chance in the world to become a leader in this crypto space. Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Be More than Just a Meme? Dogecoin has survived mainly due to its loyal fanbase and some spurts of excitement. But 2025 hasn’t been great for DOGE holders. Over the past month, Dogecoin’s price has dropped more than 30%. It recently saw a 9% price increase in the last 24 hours, but that doesn’t change the poor price range as it currently trades at $0.22. There has been talk of possible Dogecoin ETFs, but some experts are skeptical. Some believe meme coin ETFs could be risky and compare them to gambling speculations rather than legitimate investments. So the biggest issue with Dogecoin still remains the lack of more utility. While it is accepted by some merchants for payments, its price movements are still largely driven by speculation and look unlikely to compete with the new intriguing utility coin, DTX. Shiba Inu (SHIB) in a Struggle to Stay Relevant The price of Shiba Inu has also been moving downward. The price just saw a slight 24-hour increase of 3.9% and currently trades at about $0.14. Investors are still looking for bigger moves, especially when it has already fallen by 25% over the past weeks. Admittedly, the Shiba Inu team has been working hard to move away from being just a meme coin. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 scaling solution, has processed over 250M transactions so far, reducing fees by 90% and burning 12B tokens. A recent UAE ministry partnership is also leveraging ShibOS, which is built on Shibarium, for public services. Shiba Inu also recently launched “SHIB: The Metaverse,” drawing more than 100K+ users to virtual worlds of gaming and more. But these efforts are yet to result in major price increases. Conclusion Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shined in the past, but their reliance on speculation makes them risky bets. DTX Exchange, on the other hand, is built on utility. With its growing user base, strong security measures, and clear development plan, it could be poised for serious growth as we approach Q2.

As Bitcoin loses strength, investors are looking towards high-momentum altcoins, and DTX is at the forefront. With an upcoming listing and a 2x bonus offer before launch, early buyers have a very rare chance to double up even before it reaches major exchanges. Many believe this could be the best time to enter before prices surge. Bitcoin Price is Struggling, Time to Look Elsewhere? The Bitcoin price is having a hard time increasing, and the majority of traders are worried. CoinMarketCap data shows that Bitcoin price is stuck at key levels, and the sellers are stopping it from rising further. Some analysts say that this could be a sign that Bitcoin’s better days are coming to an end. As a result of this, people are now resorting to other coins that can appreciate faster and bring higher profits. One of the strongest picks out there right now is DTX Exchange. Unlike Bitcoin, DTX is new, fast, and set to rise. It can handle 200,000 transactions per second, making it much stronger. Currently, DTX Exchange is in its final presale stage, and users who use “LIST2X” get double the tokens right away. This is a 100% profit before it even goes live on major exchanges. With Bitcoin prices struggling, DTX Exchange could be the next giant altcoin in the cryptocurrency market. Cardano Price Shows Strength; Can It 10x in March? Cardano has been gaining traction as a high-performing altcoin. Recent data shows that Cardano’s price has held strong support, and analysts predict that it could see a massive 10x increase this March. Source: CoinMarketCap With growing adoption and new upgrades, Cardano is proving to be a top choice for investors looking for big gains. If momentum keeps building, Cardano’s price could break out fast, leaving slow-moving assets behind. But as an investor, if you want even bigger returns, DTX Exchange is where the real money is. Unlike Cardano, which is already a big coin, DTX Exchange is in its final presale stage at just $0.18, with a listing price of $0.36. That means investors can double their money instantly before it even goes live. DTX is not just a token, it’s a full exchange, built for speed, security, and massive liquidity. SUI Blockchain Could 10x in March, Here’s Why SUI Blockchain is growing fast, and experts say it could be 10x this March. According to a recent market analysis, SUI Blockchain has a strong trading volume and rising demand. More people are using SUI Blockchain because it is fast, cheap, and built for the future. If this trend continues, SUI Blockchain could be one of the best coins to watch this year. But DTX could be an even bigger winner. Unlike SUI Blockchain, DTX is still in presale at just $0.18, but its listing price is $0.36, meaning early buyers instantly double their money. Even better, using “LIST2X” gives investors twice the tokens, making profits even bigger. DTX Exchange: The Only Token Offering Instant 4X Gains Before Listing Imagine buying a token at $0.18 and having it listed at $0.36, that is 2X your money already. But what if you could get 4X? That is what DTX Exchange is offering currently. Investors who use the “LIST2X” code during the final presale phase get double the tokens, which makes their gains even higher before the token even goes live. DTX Exchange uses a non-custodial model, that is, you have 100% ownership of your assets, and there is no third party that holds your funds. This is safer than centralized exchanges that have been hacked and had funds frozen in the past. Another massive aspect of DTX is its revenue-sharing mechanism. Holding DTX tokens gives investors a share of the platform’s profits, so they can make passive income just by holding. This is in contrast to Bitcoin price, which only depends on market volatility. With DTX, users are rewarded while waiting for the price to increase. This makes it one of the few crypto projects that reward holders in multiple ways. As Bitcoin weakens, traders are looking for improved alternatives like Cardano, SUI Blockchain, and DTX Exchange. While ADA and SUI have good potential, DTX is offering something superior yet; instant 2X gains, non-custodial model, and an overall passive income. As crypto investors shift their focus, DTX Exchange is standing out as the best new opportunity in March.

Status XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game.

Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has seen notable price swings recently. In the past week, its price has dipped by 4.03%. Over the last month, the decline is sharper at 30.33%, highlighting a significant short-term downturn. However, looking back six months, SOL has actually grown by 26.38%, indicating long-term positive momentum despite recent drops. Currently, Solana trades between $142.98 and $197.24. The nearest resistance level is at $215.66, and the closest support level is $107.14. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $164.65, while the 100-day SMA is slightly lower at $146.41. The Relative Strength Index sits at 49.16, signaling a neutral market, but the Stochastic indicator at 17.80 suggests the asset may be oversold. These indicators point to potential for a price rebound. If SOL climbs to the nearest resistance at $215.66, it would mark an increase of about 26% from its current price around $170. A drop to the support level at $107.14 would mean a decrease of approximately 37%. Breaking through the resistance could propel Solana towards the second resistance level at $269.92, indicating significant growth potential ahead. Conclusion Solana and others excel in the bull run, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans and meme culture, aiming for significant growth and community empowerment.

If it breaches the resistance at $3.68, the next target could be $4.73. The coin’s recent weekly rise of over 9% hints that investors are still bullish. The current market conditions suggest that XRP could soon see another leg up. Cardano (ADA) on the Verge of a Breakthrough Cardano is gaining momentum, with prices ranging between $0.76 and $1.33. Recent trends suggest a potential run towards the nearest resistance level of $1.52. The Relative Strength Index is high, which signals strong buying pressure. Cardano’s price change over 1 week is near 38%, while the 6-month rise is over 230%. This suggests a robust upward trajectory. If the surge continues, ADA might test the second resistance level at $2.08, indicating a further upward potential of around 56%. Keep an eye on the support level at $0.39, as it acts as a safety net against any sudden dips. Current indicators and momentum position Cardano favorably for a bullish move. Conclusion While XRP and Cardano show less potential for short-term growth, Catzilla emerges as a promising opportunity. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale stages, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016, Catzilla offers governance features, loyalty incentives, and staking options.

What’s his plan, and why does Africa have a special meaning for Tether? Ardonio’s announcement On March 2, 2025, Ardonio took to X to tell about his vision of how to tackle the power crisis in Africa. He stated that 600 million Africans don’t have access to electricity and shared his vision of a possible solution. Ardonio suggested that there is a “plan underway.” He believes a network of kiosks with high-performance batteries and eco-friendly solar panels attached to the top can be a remedy. People will be required to buy a monthly subscription to recharge the batteries using these kiosks. They will be able to pay for it in local currency, Bitcoin, or USDT. Kiosks will provide electricity for the local community. Up to 2023, 600 million people in Africa lacked access to electricity. Imagine a kiosk in Africa, with solar panels on top to recharge hundreds of high performance batteries, offering monthly subscription to the local community (payable in local currency, Bitcoin LN or USDt).… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) March 2, 2025 The network is going to be deployed in at least two phases, with ten thousand charger locations built in the first stage. In the second stage, the number of locations will be brought to 100k. On top of providing the residents with electric power, the kiosks will provide high-quality educational materials and courses on Bitcoin and saving in Tether. More than that, Ardonio mentions “the biggest distribution network for any goods and services.” On March 3, Tether CEO added that the described plan “is not an [sic!] hypothetical,” and “few hundred kiosks are up and running.” In the comment section, Ardonio added that after Tether does power generation, it will work on infrastructure. Reactions The announcement was met with a full spectrum of reactions–from skeptical to full approval. For instance, Blocksteam CEO Adam Back expressed the willingness to broadcast his company’s educational materials about Bitcoin using these kiosks. Several commenters outlined potential problems of the enterprise or questioned Tether’s role in such an initiative. One of the commenters, Mutasco, pointed out that the decentralization spirit aligns more with creating a framework where incentives would have driven various independent actors to build such kiosks, not the company itself building the entire network. He added that the Tether Foundation could have probably come up with the framework. “This balances autonomy with centralized support that creates alignment with the ethos of building a community-owned network,” said Mutasco. In the spirit of decentralization, is this mission under a framework designed under some operator model structured as a decentralized, incentive-driven system where independent local operators can act as ambassadors and facilitators? Perhaps, Tether can support the framework… — Mutasco (🐝) (@Cryptic_Chelsea) March 3, 2025 Another commenter, who goes by the moniker Crouching Tiger Hidden Whale, questioned if the residents would be able to pay for the subscription. More than that, Crouching Tiger expressed concerns over the safety of Tether’s enterprise, saying that locals could potentially “hijack” the kiosks to use battery rechargers without the paywall. To these concerns, Ardonio noted that several hundred locations are already working and “so far so good.” Hmm.. cool concept, but do those local people have any actual income to pay for the subscription/service? 😅 And if so, is it enough to cover the capex of building it all out? 🤔 And if not… what happens if some more “enterprising” locals hijack the whole solar… — Crouching Tiger Hidden Whale (b/acc) 🍊🌋🐳 (@hidden_whale) March 2, 2025 The telecom companies reps showed up in the comment section to praise the initiative and promote their services, indicating the importance of connectivity. One of them said that in 2019, he and his partners installed two airnodes in a small remote fishing village in Tanzania, and the move proved to be very effective as now the village has tripled in size, and people feel safer and have more opportunities for selling fish. Tether in Africa and America It’s worth saying that Tether has always been vocal about its role in Africa and other regions where people lack banking and tools for saving money in stable currencies. The company’s website directly points to Africa, South, and Central America as the regions where Tether “empowers millions,” saving families “from the spiraling devaluation of their local currencies.” The USDT use has significantly grown in Africa since 2022. Bloomberg cites Tether’s Head of Economics, Philip Gradwell, who says that the main use cases of Tether in Africa are in saving value and sending money abroad. https://crypto.news/chainalysis-stablecoins-represent-40-of-crypto-economy-in-sub-saharan-africa Facilitating financial opportunities in developing countries has an accompanying mission of stretching the American dollar’s influence in these regions. Tether is one of the world’s biggest buyers of U.S. Treasury bills, so the company emphasizes its role in contributing to the elimination of the U.S. debt and galvanizing the American economy as well. The latter becomes especially relevant today when the company is facing increased scrutiny in the U.S. While the new crypto-friendly SEC consistently keeps on dropping one Gensler-era case by another, Tether finds itself in a much more heated place now than before 2025. The new GENIUS Act aimed to regulate stablecoins demands more transparency from Tether, a company that was never subjected to audits made by the big four audit companies. Some experts believe that Tether won’t be able to adhere to the rules and will have to leave the U.S. market. The U.S. Treasury is considering sanctioning Tether as it provides services for sanctioned nations like Russia and Iran and the terrorist organization Hamas. Another concern is the involvement of Tether in funding the North Korean nuke program. In October 2024, WSJ reported that federal prosecutors are investigating possible violations of sanctions and anti-money-laundering laws. The January 2024 UN report shows that Tether is one of the preferred cryptocurrencies for crime and money laundering. The report names $17.07 billion as a sum of USDT spent on illegal activities between September 2022 and September 2023, which is not a huge share of the Tether overall volume but a good excuse to intensify the scrutiny and potential prosecution. In the face of a possible withdrawal from the U.S., increasing its influence in other regions and shifting the focus from the USD-pegged stablecoins to Bitcoin may prove to be an effective recovery plan for Tether.

Kiyosaki reveals he bought more Bitcoin during the dip, anticipating a strong rebound.

This latest buy bumps its total stash to 2,888 BTC, worth over $251 million, with Bitcoin hovering around $87,198 at press time. The Japanese firm bought the dip as Bitcoin dropped over 8% on March 4 as concerns regarding a potential trade war and fresh tariffs from the U.S. continued to rattle markets. Metaplanet has dethroned Chinese gaming firm Boyaa Interactive International , which currently holds 2410 BTC, as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin hoarder, according to data from BitBo. It’s also now the 12th-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Investors are clearly liking the move—Metaplanet’s stock soared 20.93% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reaching 4,045 yen by 3:16 PM local time on March 5. Despite some volatility last week as Bitcoin slumped, Metaplanet’s stock remains one of the best performers, boasting gains of over 1,700% on a yearly timeframe. This marks the Tokyo-headquartered firm’s second BTC buy for the week.

The FIU of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission hosted a meeting to discuss countermeasures against new money laundering methods. Let’s explore the potential strategies South Korea may employ and their implications for the global crypto landscape. South Korea’s FIU Enhances AML Laws: What to Know According to the latest media report , South Korea is set to undergo a significant regulatory revamp, with a focus on strengthening Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This move comes in response to the increasing number of money laundering cases and crypto crimes. On March 5, 2025, the Financial Intelligence Unit under the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea convened a meeting. Notably, the AML Inspection Trustee Council chaired by FIU Head Park Kwang, concentrated on examining AML regulations and shared inspection plans with key agencies. The regulators remain dedicated to tackling crypto thefts and new money laundering methods. AML Inspection Trustee Council: Top Discussions Notably, South Korea’s FIU is taking proactive steps to combat novel money laundering methods such as virtual accounts and easy remittance abuse. As per the FIU’s findings, these crimes have been facilitated by the establishment of cryptocurrencies. Significantly, FIU’s AML Inspection Trustee Council prioritizes standardizing AML inspection procedures. This is to rapidly disseminate critical risk factors associated with money laundering. The recent meeting concentrated on the necessity of revamping AML rules in response to the growing crypto threats. Along with Chief Park, AML inspection officers from 11 key institutions, including the Financial Supervisory Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, and Korea Federation of Mutual Savings Banks participated in the meeting. The discussion centered around two main objectives: fortifying measures against crimes that affect livelihoods and establishing annual inspection operation plans tailored to each institution. This development comes on the heels of Upbit Operator Dunamu’s appeal against the FIU. Dunamu sought to cancel the FIU’s business suspension order. South Korea Fosters User Protection: Key Strategies As part of the current program, South Korea’s FIU is planning to establish a ‘People’s Livelihood Crime AML Joint Response Team’ in collaboration with the Financial Supervisory Service and other financial institutions. The team’s efforts will center on detecting AML vulnerabilities and implementing measures to strengthen resilience against financial crimes. South Korea’s current initiatives align with the global trend of regulatory reforms to combat crypto crimes. The US SEC is making efforts to establish a regulatory framework that guarantees both crypto growth and user protection. The European Union is also taking proactive measures to foster a healthy crypto environment. These enhanced regulatory measures are a direct response to the mounting cryptocurrency fraud. Recently, the crypto space suffered a major blow with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack , a breach that ranks among the largest crypto thefts ever.

The move follows increased efforts to combat cryptocurrency-related financial crimes. Recent high-profile cases include the GainBitcoin and BitConnect scams. As part of the collaboration, CoinDCX will provide a secure custody infrastructure to store and manage confiscated assets, the exchange said. Further, the exchange will implement security protocols to ensure asset protection. “To ensure the highest level of protection for seized assets, we have deployed a specialized team armed with advanced security protocols,” said CoinDCX co-founder Sumit Gupta. CBI and ED Seize Nearly $200M in Major Cryptocurrency Fraud Cases Authorities have ramped up enforcement following large-scale cryptocurrency fraud cases. In the GainBitcoin case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) carried out searches across multiple cities. The investigation focused on an alleged multi-crore scam tied to a Bitcoin-based multi-level marketing scheme. During these raids, the agency seized cryptocurrencies worth ₹23.94 crore (about $2.88m), along with documents and electronic devices that are currently being analyzed for evidence of financial misappropriation and cross-border transactions. Similarly, in the BitConnect scam, the ED seized digital assets worth ₹1,646 crore (about $198m) last month. The scam defrauded investors worldwide. As a result, authorities raided multiple locations across Gujarat. They confiscated ₹13.50 lakh (around $16,250) in cash, an SUV and several digital devices. Following a two-day search of over 60 locations in India's major cities, the police confiscated $2.75 million worth of #crypto in connection to the #GainBitcoin scam. #CryptoScam #India https://t.co/3cGVdjqFdR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 26, 2025 Tighter Crypto Regulations Aim to Protect Investors from Fraudulent Schemes “CoinDCX has been cooperative and assisted in the seizure process, providing valuable support in the investigation led by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The company has worked closely with the directorate, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements and facilitating the opening of the custodian account on urgent basis,” said Parneet Kumar, Assistant Director at the ED.

The deal includes measures aimed at reducing the country’s Bitcoin exposure. Despite the agreement, El Salvador has continued to increase its Bitcoin portfolio. The El Salvador government has continued its effort to bolster the country’s economy with Bitcoin. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) however, has expressed concern for the country’s financial stability as cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. In 2024, the El Salvador government agreed to scale back on its Bitcoin ambitions in exchange for a much-needed billion-dollar loan. The deal with the IMF included measures such as businesses in El Salvador no longer being mandated to accept Bitcoin and the payment of taxes in US dollars and not cryptocurrency. However, El Salvador President, Nayib Bukele is now reneging on the deal and sticking to his Bitcoin strategy. El Salvador’s $1.4B deal In 2024, the IMF released a statement saying that in exchange for the financial aid program to support the government’s economic overhaul agenda, the El Salvador government agreed to implement measures to mitigate bitcoin-related risks. The decision to make Bitcoin a legal tender in the country was met with cheers from crypto enthusiasts, but it caused a delay in the country receiving financial support from the IMF as there were concerns about the volatility of crypto assets. The IMF believed that the introduction of Bitcoin as a legal tender would cause further decline in the finances of El Salvador, an already impoverished and indebted nation. The government of the country did not share these concerns and set its Bitcoin ambitions in motion, purchasing one Bitcoin daily since November 2022. While the country’s adoption of Bitcoin became more accepted over time, problems like the volatility of digital assets and the lack of understanding of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has led most of the population to opt for the US dollar for their transactions. This, of course, did not deter the government from building its Bitcoin reserve. Data indicates that the El Salvador government now holds approximately 6,101 BTC, valued at around $527 million at current market prices. The country’s latest acquisition of 19 BTC is a lump sum accumulated over multiple previous purchases made in January and February, even after the IMF agreement was finalized. proof of whining.'"" width=""1272"" height=""1570"" /> El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio. Source: The Bitcoin Office The IMF’s financial aid agreement with El Salvador includes specific measures to limit the government’s involvement with Bitcoin. These measures include a ban on new acquisitions, so it was expected that the country would stop its Bitcoin acquisition. However, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele is clearly ignoring these restrictions. Bukele posted on social media platform X that the country’s Bitcoin purchases would continue. “This all stops in April. stops in June. This all stops in December. No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining,” He said . “This all stops in April.” “This all stops in June.” “This all stops in December.” No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most “bitcoiners” abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining https://t.co/9pC0PoY3YQ — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) March 4, 2025 The IMF has not made any comments regarding Bukele’s disregard for the agreed terms. As a part of the deal, the El Salvador government is required to publish all wallet addresses used for Bitcoin transactions. Audited financial statements must also be released for crypto-related government entities. The Fidebitcoin trust fund must also be liquidated by July 2025, in accordance with the agreement. The trust fund was originally established to support Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. The government is also expected to withdraw from direct involvement in the country’s official Bitcoin payment platform, the Chivo Wallet system. The agreement between the IMF and El Salvador is anticipated to draw in supplementary funding from the World Bank and other regional development banks. The country’s $1.4B deal with the IMF is expected to snowball into $3.5B with the support from these other financial organizations. The IMF said in a release that, “the program is also expected to catalyze additional financial support from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and other regional development banks (Central American Bank for Economic Integration, CABEI, Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean, CAF) for a combined overall financing package of over US$ 3.5 billion over the program period.” El Salvador is now looking into alternative strategies Although Bukele’s strategy started with Bitcoin adoption, it has expanded over time to include the booming AI and tech industry. The government is adjusting the regulatory framework and pushing policies that are sure to attract tech companies and improve the country’s economic future. On March 2, official accounts posted photos of Bukele’s meetings with Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen, the co-founders of a16z, discussing technology and AI investment opportunities.

El Salvador wants to become a regional tech hub and a leading destination for entrepreneurs and investors. To achieve this, El Salvador is offering incentives such as a 0% tax rate for companies in tech industries. Tether , the issuer of the world’s largest USDT stablecoin has already migrated its head office to the Central American nation. The government also created the National Artificial Intelligence Agency (ANIA). This agency operates under the Office of the Presidency to oversee AI-related activities in the country.

Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen Discusses Future & Security,https://coingape.com/brandtalk/opinion/will-crypto-wallets-replace-exchanges-trust-wallet-ceo-eowyn-chen-discusses-future-security/,"With no doubt, the crypto industry has witnessed remarkable growth in 2024, with over 562 million people worldwide owning various forms of digital currencies. This accounts for approximately 6.8% of the global population, according to crypto ownership data from Triple-A. As Web3 adoption accelerates, Crypto Wallets are also evolving beyond simple storage solutions into multifunctional financial tools. The global crypto wallet market, valued at USD 8.42 billion in 2022 by Grand View Research, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8% from 2023 to 2030. The critical role of Web3 wallets in safeguarding digital assets further came into focus following the recent $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, exposing vulnerabilities in Web3 wallet infrastructure. Safe{Wallet}, an institutional multi-signature smart contract wallet provider, has recently acknowledged its role in one of the largest thefts the crypto world has ever seen. As crypto wallets gain wider adoption, CoinGape speaks with Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen in this exclusive opinion piece on the evolving role of crypto wallets and the need for an improved user experience. She also discusses essential security measures for Web3 wallets, particularly in light of Safe{Wallet}’s acknowledgment of its infrastructure’s role in the Bybit hack. Crypto adoption doesn’t happen in a vacuum—it happens when people can seamlessly integrate crypto into their everyday lives. That’s why wallets are no longer just storage tools; they’ve got to evolve into personal companions that help users buy, store, and use crypto in a number of ways that feel intuitive and natural,” says CEO Eowyn Chen. At Trust Wallet, we believe adoption starts with ease of usability and a real sense of security. If interacting with crypto is complicated or feels risky, most people won’t take that first step. A Web3 wallet should make self-custody effortless, giving users full control over their assets while ensuring a secure and frictionless experience. Web3 Wallets’ Evolving Role beyond just as ‘Crypto Storage tools’ In their jouney of evolution since 2009, crypto wallets are becoming more user-friendly and intuitive to attract mainstream users. Though in the early days, wallets were used primarily to store and transfer Bitcoin and early altcoin, today with the rise of smart contract, they are acting as Web3 gateways for various digital services. From the early days of Bitcoin Core and Paper wallets in 2009, we are witnessing the rise of Centralised Exchange hybrid wallets and In-app/in-device wallets such as Trust Wallet’s mobile based approach. Major exchanges such as Binance, OKY, Kraken and Bybit have integrated self-custodial crypto wallets within their CEX applications. Further, following the Solana Saga Phone’s success, there is also an influx of hardware-based Blockchain products which feature in-built crypto wallets. The days of wallets being just “crypto vaults” are over. As the industry evolves, wallets are becoming the gateway to everything on-chain —whether it’s swapping tokens, participating in DeFi, exploring NFTs, or managing digital identity or even the AI data economy to come soon. But with this expanded role comes responsibility. Cautioning, CEO Chen further says, “But with this expanded role comes responsibility. A Web3 wallet must also be secure, reliable, and easy to use, ensuring that anyone—whether a first-time user or an experienced trader—can confidently engage with blockchain technology. As we adopt more users, the user profile and needs also become more diverse than before. As such, a useful wallet also needs to be personal – understanding the users’ needs and stages in their journey to better serve them.” Owing to the rising players in the Web3 wallet space, there is also an increasing competition among the CEXs, Web3 Fintech and Web2 messaging applications such as Telegram. Vying for acquiring a greater user base with increased crypto adoption, these players are continuously working on improving user experience. I believe that user experience (UX) is the foundation of driving widespread adoption in the Web3 space. A great UX isn’t just about seamless functionality—it’s about ensuring users feel secure, confident, and empowered as they explore the decentralized world,” says Trust Wallet CEO. Are Crypto SuperApps the future of Crypto Wallets As the leaders in the industry are working on improvising user-interface by providing access to various decentralized applications (dApps) directly on users’ wallet, the role of crypto wallets is set for further expansion. A 2024 Report by Binance on ‘The Future of Crypto Wallets’ in fact projected that the wallets can follow on the lines of ‘Browser Wars’ of Web2 in near future. They can soon transition from just financial tools to comprehensive tools for managing various digital services akin to browsers with greater access to third-party dApps. In Web2, we have seen many such remarkable expansions and growth, viz., Uber, Grab, Musk’s X – to name a few. More than ever, people want a seamless way to interact with Web3 without the technical complexity. The next generation of wallets will remove friction—users won’t have to worry about which blockchain they’re on, how gas fees work, or whether they need multiple platforms to swap tokens or stake assets. Everything will just work. As wallets evolve, their role will go beyond transactions. They will help users manage their digital lives effortlessly, making Web3 more accessible, intuitive, and secure for everyone. Will Crypto Wallets end up in replacing Exchanges Recently, in an interaction, Binance CEO and founder, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, opined that wallets can replace exchanges for everyday Crypto use. CZ stated, “Most people shouldn’t have to use an exchange,” indicating that wallets are better suited for routine crypto activities. He suggested that crypto exchanges should serve as liquidity pools for large traders, rather than platforms for everyday users. C On the question of replacing exchanges, Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen says, “CZ has an interesting point. A lot of what you can do with web3 platforms like Trust Wallet overlaps with what exchanges have traditionally been known for. Buying and selling crypto, for example, is something users can do directly within Trust Wallet through our trusted partners—without needing to go through a centralized exchange. Many people also hold their crypto on exchanges, which is convenient but comes with risks, especially in light of recent security breaches and platform failures. This is what makes using a self-custody wallet so attractive—it gives users full ownership and control over their assets, rather than relying on a third party to safeguard them. When CZ mentioned the point, he thinks Centralized exchanges should focus on serving trading scenarios. So far the performance, experiences, and fees on CEX are still better than DEXs. But still, during this cycle, we have observed a significant increase in DEX trading volumes, reaching well over $500 billion in January 2025, according to DefiLlama . So do DEXs impose a threat onto CEX? I think so. Can it fully replace CEX? I hope so, but we will see how the industry evolves. Though the fact that centralized exchanges and self-custody wallets serve unique purposes, and both have a role to play in the broader crypto ecosystem, can’t be denied. CEXs users prefer using an exchange for having a third party control over their funds and assured security, while those who prefer latter prioritize self-control. Bottleneck in Web3 Wallet Security Infra The recent Bybit Hack and the subsequent acceptance of Safe Wallet about the role of its fault infrastructure in the stealth theft, exposes the major security bottlenecks yet to be resolved in the Web3 Wallet infrastructure. On solutions, CEO Chen says, “to stay ahead, wallet providers must act proactively: conducting regular security audits not only within their own systems but also across third-party integrations to catch vulnerabilities early, and deploying real-time monitoring to spot anomalies like unusual transaction patterns. These aren’t new ideas—they’re proven practices from Web2 and traditional finance. Looking forward, wallet security will mean smarter risk detection, better recovery options, and stronger authentication—think of it as technology that anticipates threats before they strike. But for us, it’s bigger than that. It’s about giving users the confidence and tools to thrive in Web3. That’s the future we’re building at Trust Wallet. We’re investing heavily in features like our built-in security scanner and real-time monitoring, while also prioritizing user education to help our community navigate risks with clarity.

What to Expect ? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News US President Donald Trump is making waves in both the financial and crypto markets with his latest move. On Sunday, March 2, the crypto market saw a significant rally after Trump announced that five major cryptocurrencies- Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Ethereum would be added to the US’s new strategic reserve. This initiative aims to position the US as the “Crypto Capital of the World.” Historic Crypto Summit! But that’s not all. A historic event is set to happen this Friday, March 7, as Trump will host the first-ever White House Crypto Summit , marking a key moment for both US politics and the crypto industry. David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, will organize and manage the summit, with Bo Hines, the executive director of the working group, assisting. President Trump will lead the event. Sacks revealed that key founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto world will meet with Trump’s digital assets working group at the White House to dive into crucial discussions on crypto policy and potential regulations. Key Attendees and Topics In Focus The summit will focus on key topics like the US strategic reserve’s role in crypto, setting industry guidelines, expanding stablecoin oversight, opposing a US CBDC, and creating a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” with major cryptocurrencies. It will also explore regulatory frameworks to support growth, balance regulation with innovation, and consider tax-free crypto sales to boost adoption. The White House Crypto Summit will feature key figures like President Trump, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov, and others. Other crypto leaders like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Jesse Powell and the Winklevoss twins may attend. In the 119th Congress, some Republican lawmakers have introduced competing stablecoin bills, aiming to establish a regulatory framework for these digital assets. However, Democratic lawmakers have criticized President Trump for launching the $TRUMP memecoin shortly before his inauguration, alleging potential conflicts of interest and ethical concerns. Nevertheless, the summit seems to be the first major gathering of digital asset leaders at the White House. Under Trump, the SEC has halted investigations and enforcement actions against many digital asset firms. These changes align with the Trump administration’s broader efforts to foster innovation and position the U.S. as a leader in the cryptocurrency sector.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 07:41:32

Originally set for March 6, the hearing is now rescheduled for April 10, according to a March 3 ruling from Judge Paul Engelmayer. The decision followed a February 27 letter from prosecutors indicating they expected to provide an additional four terabytes of discovery to the defense. Newly Acquired Evidence Includes Data from Warrants and Third-Party Documents The newly acquired material reportedly includes evidence obtained through warrants on several electronic accounts, as well as documents from third-party organizations and individuals. Prosecutors explained that they had already supplied Kwon’s team with approximately 600 gigabytes of data, including information from four of his cellphones and emails from both his personal and corporate accounts. Moreover, details related to Kwon’s extradition, the FBI’s retrieval of evidence in Montenegro, statements made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and records of digital asset trading activity have been shared with the defense. The Terra ecosystem’s collapse in May 2022 wiped out an estimated $60 billion in market capitalization. Its algorithmic stablecoin, TerraClassicUSD (USTC), lost its dollar peg, plummeting below one cent. The sudden destabilization, accompanied by heavy sell pressure, also contributed to Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) losing the majority of its value. Kwon, who is of South Korean nationality, spent months traveling between Singapore and Dubai before arriving in Montenegro, where authorities apprehended him in March 2023. He had allegedly attempted to depart for Dubai using fraudulent travel documents. Following a four-month prison term, negotiations between Montenegrin authorities and the United States resulted in Kwon’s extradition last December. For those asking, I can confirm Do Kwon's status conference has been pushed back from March to April to account for additional evidence discovery The government is adding 4 cellphones belonging to Kwon to the stack of evidence Trial still set to begin in January 2026 pic.twitter.com/OALr78EnlY — Zack Guzmán (@zGuz) March 4, 2025 He made his first appearance before a U.S. court on January 2, pleading not guilty to nine felony counts, all tied to alleged fraud. Despite the postponement of his next hearing, Kwon’s trial remains on track for January 26, 2026. Pretrial motions are due by July 1, with responses to those motions required by August 11, as set forth by the court. Judge Signs Off on $4.5B Terraform, Do Kwon Settlement with SEC In June last year, U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) approved a settlement that will require Terraform Labs and Kwon to pay a staggering $4.5 billion in disgorgement and civil penalties. Additionally, they will be permanently banned from engaging in any transactions involving “crypto asset securities,” which includes tokens within the Terra ecosystem. The settlement came after initial proposals from the SEC suggested a $5.3 billion penalty, which Terraform Labs contested by advocating for a maximum fine of $1 million. Ultimately, on June 6, the legal representatives for both Kwon and Terraform Labs agreed to the SEC’s revised settlement offer of $4.5 billion. Terraform Labs, currently operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, faces the challenge of how to fulfill the substantial financial obligations imposed by the settlement.

The event will be hosted by Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks , and industry leaders are hoping for regulatory clarity that could help the US retain blockchain talent and foster domestic crypto business growth following years of oppression under the previous administration. On March 5, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett said that “invites were sent to attendees via email this afternoon,” meaning Tuesday. However, there were no further details in the missive beyond time and location, she said. NEW: A little more detail here — invites were sent to attendees via email this afternoon.

The gathering of around 20-25 people will be a roundtable setting at the White House and include other members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, which is why the industry invites will be fewer, she added. Aside from Sacks and the Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, Bo Hines, it was unclear who else would attend on behalf of the government. However, the President’s Working Group on crypto also includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and the chairs of the SEC and CFTC. “A larger, invite-only reception is being planned across the street from the White House after for those not invited to the roundtable meeting.” Also on the list of attendees are Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, Zach Witkoff, the co-founder of the Trump family DeFi platform World Liberty Finance, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. An unconfirmed list of invite recipients was also posted, which included Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, Circle boss Jeremy Allaire, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, Vitalik Buterin, and the Winklevoss twins. However, these people have yet to be officially confirmed. Potential discussion topics include establishing a US crypto reserve , stablecoin oversight, potential tax incentives for crypto businesses, and AI’s role in crypto fraud detection and compliance. Ethereum Representation? Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano commented on Ethereum representation, considering that Trump’s DeFi platform is based on and buying ETH, Coinbase’s layer-2 and stablecoin are Ethereum-based, and Robinhood and Kraken are working closely with Ethereum L2s. “Would love to have someone from Etherealize in the room (hopefully Danny Ryan) but Ethereum does have pretty good representation already.” Core Ethereum developer Ryan responded with, “I think I could do an excellent job broadly representing Ethereum’s interests in this kind of environment.

While Trump's addition of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to the reserve, XRP, ADA and SOL, drew the reaction of industry leaders, Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter stated that Trump's crypto reserve plan contains eight risks and listed these risks. Nic Carter argued that Trump’s proposed cryptocurrency reserve could harm both Bitcoin and the U.S. government, arguing that the five-cryptocurrency reserve proposal undermines Bitcoin’s value proposition and serves personal interests. “1. Reserve plan rollback risk: Without congressional approval, a future administration could easily reverse policy and disrupt the market. 2. Dollar market instability: Tying cryptocurrencies to US reserves could shake confidence in the dollar and Treasury markets. 3. Limited need for Bitcoin exposure: The US already benefits from more BTC than any other country through investor tax benefits. American funds and individuals also hold more Bitcoin than citizens of other countries. 4. No strategic use case: Unlike oil or rare minerals, crypto reserves do not serve a core function for national security or economic stability. 5. Potential devaluation of BTC: Mixing Bitcoin with rival crypto assets Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and XRP and giving them all equal government approval would devalue Bitcoin and make it appear undifferentiated from those assets. It would undermine BTC’s unique decentralization. 6. Bitcoin doesn’t need a government: BTC has become a multi-trillion dollar asset without government intervention; government support can politicize it. 7. Public backlash: With only 5-20% of Americans owning $BTC, investing taxpayer money in crypto reserves could lead to unnecessary public backlash. 8. Conflicts of interest may increase: Trump and his allies hold a variety of crypto assets. Concerns are growing that the Reserve is using government resources to increase the value of coins held by Trump and many in his inner circle. Nic Carter recently warned that Trump’s diversified US crypto reserve plan could backfire, undermining BTC’s independence and leading to political instability. *This is not investment advice.

AAVE tokens are up 21% in the past 24 hours, beating a 3.5% bump in the broader market tracked by the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , as a successful passage of the proposed changes could bump the fundamentals of holding aave tokens. The so-termed “Aavenomics update” was initially green-lit in August 2024. Aave’s cash pile has ballooned by 115% to $115 million since mid-2024, with the platform’s GHO stablecoin hitting a $200 million supply and reporting strong revenues. And Aave wants to give back some of those figures to users. A key proposed point is to increase profit sharing for people who stake their AAVE tokens to support the system. Next is Anti-GHO, a special token that can’t be traded but can be used in two ways: burn it to wipe out GHO debt (like paying off a loan for free) or turn it into staked GHO (StkGHO) for extra rewards. Anti-GHO will come from half of GHO’s revenue, which stands at $6 million a year based on GHO’s $12 million annual haul. The DAO proposes a “buy and distribute” program that aims to deploy $1 million a week to buy AAVE tokens from the open market, aiming to keep its value steady and reward users long-term. The buybacks can begin immediately and could grow in six months. On the technical side, the DAO proposes “Umbrella,” a self-protection system that shields users from losses if the market crashes. “Aave will be the only protocol able to protect users from bad debt up to billions, as competitors have essentially given up on protecting their users,” the proposal read. “This unique advantage will make Aave even more attractive, especially for institutions concerned with on-chain risks. Community feedback is open on the proposal as of Wednesday morning, and a formal on-chain proposal will be floated in the coming weeks.",Markets|Aave|DAO|tokenomics,EN,0,0,AAVE|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 07:51:38

A whale that received compensation during the Genesis Trading last year in August 2024, sold a staggering 40,000 ETH in this market crash. Amid its strong underperformance, the market sentiment for the altcoin seems to be worsening further. Ethereum Whale Offloads 40,000 ETH Amid Market Uncertainty A major Ethereum whale, known for receiving the largest ETH compensation during the Genesis Trading liquidation in August 2024, has reportedly sold 40,000 ETH, worth a staggering $89.9 million through over-the-counter (OTC) trades in the past two days. This address had received a total of 114,500 ETH valued at $358.19 million during the liquidation process, as per data from Arkham Intelligence . However, it has now offloaded nearly 30% of its holdings in the last two days. This comes as the ETH price has been on a free fall , dropping more than 13% over the last week, raising concerns about price stability. Source: Arkham Intelligence Unrealized Profits Plunge to Bear Market Levels According to data from CryptoQuant, the unrealized profit ratio among Ethereum whales has dropped to levels not seen since the previous bear market. The ETH/BTC ratio has been on a continuous downtrend amid the growing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. Despite Ethereum’s price being roughly twice as high as it was during the bear market, many whale positions are now yielding the same profit levels as before. Notably, the whale cohort holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH has reverted to a negative unrealized profit ratio. This shows a concerning situation as analysts warn of heightened volatility ahead for ETH. Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, the ETH exchange deposits have also been on the rise. On-chain data shows that over the last two weeks, investors have moved more than 60,000 ETH to exchanges, suggesting heightened selling pressure. ETH Price Repeats Historical Patterns From 2019 Prominent crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has drawn parallels between current ETH price action and its performance during the previous Federal Reserve monetary tightening cycle. According to Cowen, Ethereum is repeating its 2019 behavior during the Fed’s quantitative tightening (QT) phase. The analyst noted that in 2019, ETH formed a wedge pattern under QT conditions, and remained in the same structure for almost a year. A brief breakout above the wedge preceded a sharp decline below it. Interestingly, it also coincided with the Fed’s QT policy shortly afterward. This marked a bottom for the ETH/BTC pair, followed by a rally in ETH/USD, though the price later dipped deeper into its regression band. Source: Benjamin Cowen Cowen notes that this cycle appears to be unfolding similarly, with the main difference being the extended duration of QT in the current cycle. Presently, the ETH price has broken down from its wedge pattern into its regression band. The analyst suggests there are “decent odds” that the Fed could end QT within the next few months. As of press time, ETH price is trading 5.46% up at $2,191 with daily trading volumes down 16.73%. Moreover, the ETH open interest is up 2.62% to $19.23 billion. If ETH price drops under the crucial support of $2,000, it can further tank to $1,000.

The biggest upgrade to Ethereum since 2024, Pectra consists of 11 major features , or ""Ethereum improvement proposals"" (EIPs), that will be shipped all at once. Together, the features aim to enhance staking, wallet functionality, and overall network efficiency. Sepolia's Pectra upgrade, which was completed at 07:29:36 UTC , followed a failed test on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet last week. A misconfiguration among validators resulted in a chain split , rendering Holesky temporarily unusable . Testnets mimic a main blockchain and are used by developers to test code changes in a low-stakes environment. Holesky, which has a validator structure closer to Ethereum’s mainnet than Sepolia, was seen as a critical proving ground for Pectra. (Developers are still working to get Holesky back into operation and have set up an alternative developer network as a temporary testing ground for validators .) Ethereum developers are set to meet on Mar. 6 to discuss Pectra's mainnet release timeline. With only one fully successful test, developers may opt to delay the mainnet deployment to ensure stability. One key Pectra proposal that will benefit Ethereum validators is EIP-7251, which increases the maximum amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. The change is meant to address today's clunky staking system, where validators who stake more than their 32 ETH must split their stake across multiple nodes. Another highly-anticipated proposal, EIP-7702, would let crypto wallets temporarily function as smart contracts. The change moves Ethereum closer to account abstraction, enabling wallets to offer more user-friendly features. For example, users could pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of ETH, set up automatic payments for subscriptions, or recover access to their wallets without relying on complex seed phrases. Pectra's rocky test cycle comes as Ethereum's developers are under pressure to ship upgrades more quickly. Some Ethereum fans fear the network is losing its edge to newer chains like Solana, which has gained mindshare in recent months due to its popularity among meme coin users. The price of ETH has also recently underperformed relative to other major coins, and the Ethereum Foundation—the non-profit steward of the network's development—has been beset by leadership drama.

Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoins-75500-analyst-historical-magnet-level/,"An analyst has pointed out how the 50-week moving average (MA) of Bitcoin has historically acted as a sort of magnet for the asset’s price. 50-Week MA Is Currently Situated At $75,500 For Bitcoin In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about the 50-week MA of Bitcoin. An “MA” is a technical analysis indicator that calculates the average value of any asset’s price over a given period of time and as its name suggests, moves in time, updating its value according to the changes in the price itself. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Crashes 15% After Massive Profit-Taking Spike MAs can be useful tools for studying long-term trends in an asset, as they smooth out the price curve to remove any local deviations. An MA can be taken over any window of time, but there are some particularly popular choices like the 200-day. In the context of the current topic, the time-range of focus is the 50-week. Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in this MA for Bitcoin over the past decade or so: As is visible in the above graph, Bitcoin has been approaching this line following the latest market downturn. The asset has previously shown several retests of this level over the years. “The 50-week moving average has historically acted as a magnet for Bitcoin $BTC during trend shifts,” explains Martinez. So far in the current cycle, the line has acted as support for the cryptocurrency, helping prevent the bull run from running out of steam. At present, the 50-week MA is situated at $75,500. Given the current trajectory of the asset, it’s possible that a retest of the level may end up taking place once more. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the level would again provide support to Bitcoin, or if it would usher in the bear market. In some other news, sentiment among the US investors has plummeted recently, as CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has revealed in an X post. In the chart, the data of the “Coinbase Premium Index” is displayed. This metric measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The former platform is mainly used by American investors, while the latter serves a global traffic, so the indicator’s value essentially tells us about how the behavior differs between the two demographics. During the rally earlier, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index spiked to a sharp positive level, suggesting the US-based whales were buying. Shortly after, though, it dipped back into the negative and has since plunged deeper into the zone, implying users on the exchange are doing some heavy distribution.

In a new interview with CNBC, Lee says that Bitcoin may increase more than 70% from its current value in 2025 as the top digital asset by market cap continues to see increasing adoption among investors. He also says that Bitcoin’s recent correction was expected by some experts and that BTC may suddenly surge. “I would say what’s interesting is Bitcoin’s not had negative headlines in February, but it was down. But I know our technician, Mark Newton, had talked about this being a cyclical downturn in Bitcoin through the end of March. So he was talking mid-January getting down to $62,000… As you know, Bitcoin makes all of its gains in 10 days, so if people sort of try to time this they’re going to miss out on a chance for Bitcoin to go back to its highs.” Lastly, Lee says that Bitcoin may see massive adoption this year with the possibility of capital markets firm Citadel Securities entering the crypto sector. “I think it’s going to do better than $150,000 this year… because it’s becoming more widely held. You know if Citadel starts trading it, it starts to have more broad acceptance.” Bitcoin is trading for $87,897 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

Metaplanet Sees Strong Year-to-Date BTC Yield of 45.1% Additionally, the company’s CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that Metaplanet has achieved a year-to-date BTC yield of 45%. This performance is well above the firm’s pre-defined target of achieving 35% BTC yield for every quarter of 2025. In February, Metaplanet noted that it achieved a 23.2% BTC yield year-to-date and targets a 35% yield by this year. The “Japanese MicroStrategy” has already announced its ambitious plan of accumulating 21,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2026. Last week, the Japanese investment firm announced the issuance of $13.6 million in Zero-Interest bonds to fund additional Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin Price Dip Favors Whales Following Metaplanet’s recent Bitcoin accumulations, the company’s stock rallied, rising above 19%, all the way to ¥4045 at press time . In February, the stock price increased to an all-time high around ¥6,500 levels, however, slumped nearly 50% of its gains in a few weeks, amid Bitcoin price corrections. Further, the fresh BTC purchase comes amid the crypto’s extreme volatility and lack of sustained momentum. Hopes of a scaling down in U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs have aided risk appetite. Having initially tumbled below $80,000 last week, Bitcoin rebounded following Trump’s announcement of five cryptos , including Bitcoin, for crypto reserve. However, this recovery was short-lived with the price dropping to $83,000 on Monday. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the slump could be the time to “start setting cash aside and get ready for a potential buy-the-dip opportunity.” #Bitcoin $BTC Sharpe Ratio typically resets to ""Low Risk"" after hitting ""High Risk.""

As the crypto market awaits to see whether Congress will support Trump’s plan, speculation is rife about which other altcoins will be included. The upcoming White House Crypto Summit has offered some clues, with its list of invitees hinting at potential additions to the reserve. Top Altcoins that Trump Could Add to the Crypto Strategic Reserve According to CryptoRank, Trump meme coins are not likely to be part of the reserve. Instead, US altcoins with strong fundamentals like Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Polkadot (DOT), and Hedera (HBAR) are likely to be picked. Chainlink (LINK) Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret has confirmed that Chainlink founder Sergey Nazarov will attend the White House crypto summit. This could see Trump recognize LINK in future crypto announcements. Moreover, last week, Nazarov met with Congressman Tom Emmer and the Executive Director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, Bo Hines. This stirred s peculation of LINK being added to the reserve. Chainlink is also one of the top altcoins to buy after a 6% gain in 24 hours to trade at $14.94. Chainlink’s CMF is also tipping north suggesting a rise in buying pressure. As interest continues, and Chainlink price flips resistance at $22, it could stir a rally to the 178.6% Fibonacci level. LINK/USDT: 1-day Chart Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin is also one of the altcoins likely to be included in the US crypto reserve due to its similarities to Bitcoin. Moreover, Litecoin has a pending ETF application with the SEC. As Bloomberg analysts stated, Litecoin is likely to become the second altcoin ETF in the US. This is because the SEC has never considered Litecoin to be a security. This regulatory clarity also makes it an ideal pick for the reserve. Litecoin price today trades at $102 after a 2% drop in 24 hours amid bearish trends in the broader market. Despite the price drop, the Litecoin network has seen rapid growth after the hash rate tripled in the last 12 months. This shows miner confidence and supports a bullish Litecoin price prediction . Litecoin Hash Rate Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is also one of the best altcoins to buy as it is likely to get picked for a crypto reserve. As Coingape reported, 21Shares has filed for a spot DOT ETF with the SEC. Nasdaq also recently submitted a 19b-4 filing for the ETF. Polkadot founder Gavin Wood has not confirmed whether he has been invited to the White House. If Wood attends this summit it will increase DOT’s chance of being picked to be part of the reserve. At press time, sellers continued to weigh on Polkadot price with RSI dropping to 41. However, DOT was in a demand zone. which could spark buying activity and a rally to resistance at $5.20. DOT/USDT: 1-day Chart Hedera (HBAR) Hedera can also be one of the altcoins included in the reserve. HBAR is also the best crypto to buy as it has gained much attention since Grayscale filed for a spot HBAR ETF with the SEC. If approved, the ETF could strengthen HBAR’s regulatory standing. Hedera price has registered massive gains this week despite bearish trends across the broader crypto market. At press time, HBAR trades at $0.25 after a 26% gain in seven days. The altcoin’s RSI is rising and the AO bars have flipped green showing a bullish Hedera price forecast . This could see Hedera price rise to flip resistance at $0.26. HBAR/USD: 1-day Chart Summary of Top 4 Altcoins That Trumo Could Add to a US Crypto Reserve Chainlink, Litecoin, Poldatot, and Hedera are likely to be the next altcoins to be included in a US crypto reserve. These coins have some strong fundamentals and positive regulatory standing that make them ideal candidates.

In a March 5 press release shared with crypto.news, CoinDCX confirmed it will manage the custody of confiscated assets, following its cooperation with the Enforcement Directorate and its role in supporting the seizure process for ED investigations involving crypto. CoinDCX co-founder Sumit Gupta said the exchange has set up a specialized team equipped with advanced security protocols, including multi-signature and multi-party computation wallets, for managing custody.

The investor protection fund is designed to compensate users for losses incurred in “extremely rare scenarios such as security breaches” and at the start held nearly $6 million from the exchange’s profits. In late February, crypto.news reported that crypto trading volumes in India jumped to $1.9 billion in Q4 2024, more than doubling from the previous quarter, as smaller-city investors sought new income sources amid weak job growth and wages. Retail traders are driving most of the activity. Out of the top 10 cities leading crypto adoption in 2024, seven were smaller cities like Jaipur, Lucknow, and Pune, where people are turning to crypto for extra income. Despite high taxes and regulatory uncertainty, India’s crypto market is projected to grow beyond $15 billion by 2035, says Kush Wadhwa, partner at consulting firm Grant Thornton Bharat.

Negative sentiment around Trump is rising, with concerns that his policies—like tariffs and a proposed U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve—could manipulate markets. Investors worry that tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China may fuel volatility across crypto and stocks. Meanwhile, debates surge over the legitimacy of a U.S. crypto reserve, with skepticism about which assets—Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, or Cardano—should be included. Market fluctuations continue, as uncertainty around these developments keeps traders on edge. Hence, the crypto market remains in a state of uncertainty as Bitcoin struggles to maintain its footing, dropping below $91K again and now hovering around $85 K. While institutional adoption and regulatory advancements continue, short-term price action remains shaky, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen. https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1897135059066609724 Altcoins Take a Beating, AI Tokens Suffer Worst Losses Most Layer 1 projects have suffered double-digit losses YTD, with XRP (+5.3%) being the sole exception. BTC (-7.87%), TON (-7.94%), and TIA (-9.55%) have all faced declines. Layer 2 (L2) solutions and AI tokens have been hit hardest, with L2s down over 40% year-to-date and some AI-focused tokens plunging nearly 90% from their highs. The only exceptions in this downturn are Maker (MKR), which has gained 10%, and XRP, which is up 5%. Ethereum’s on-chain activity has slowed significantly, with median gas fees dropping to 1 GWEI, the lowest in over a year. While Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks like Base remain active, overall market participation appears to be dwindling. DeFi tokens also struggled, except for MKR (+10.85%), which has benefited from USDS adoption. Other DeFi projects, such as ENA and AERO, have been among the biggest losers, down over 50% YTD. What’s Next? Market sentiment is split—some see the current price action as a bearish retest, while others believe a recovery is underway. BTC’s re-entry into its previous range suggests the latter is more likely. Many tokens have retraced gains from the election-driven rally and may take time to recover. With weak price action across major sectors, Nansen’s analysts remain neutral to bearish in the short term but optimistic in the long run. Many traders are focusing on stablecoin yield farming rather than chasing altcoin pumps, waiting for a clearer trend reversal before making major moves. For now, Bitcoin is back in its previous range, and sentiment remains mixed. Some see the current dip as an opportunity to accumulate core assets like BTC, SOL, and TIA, while others believe a further downside is possible. Until a clearer trend emerges, the market remains in a holding pattern",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 08:10:59

This price jump coincides with a major milestone as the project surpasses 4 million followers on X. With increasing adoption, community engagement, and speculation about a potential Binance and Coinbase listing, can Pi Coin price reach the $100 mark? Pi Network Hits Major Milestone: Here’s All Pi Network’s recent milestone highlights its expanding community and growing influence. The official X account celebrated the achievement , stating that the network now has over 4 million followers. This massive following reflects strong investor confidence and sustained interest in the project. Source: Pi Network, X Meanwhile, adding to the bullish sentiment, Pi Coin secured the 11th spot among top cryptocurrencies by market cap outpacing Hedera. A crypto analyst known as ‘The Times of PiNetwork’ pointed out that Pi Coin has achieved this rank without being listed on leading crypto exchanges. Notably, the post emphasized that a Binance or Coinbase listing could trigger a price rally, potentially pushing Pi Coin price towards the $100 milestone. But why do these Binance and Coinbase listings matter? How Binance & Coinbase Listings Impact? A listing on the leading crypto exchanges could be a game-changer for Pi Network. Analysts believe that such a move would significantly increase Pi Coin’s liquidity and accessibility, driving a surge in demand. Increased Trading Volume: Being listed on Binance or Coinbase would expose Pi Coin to a wider audience, leading to higher trading activity. More users would have the opportunity to buy and sell Pi, creating upward price momentum. Global Recognition: The listing would boost Pi Coin’s credibility, attracting institutional investors and further strengthening its market position. Expanded User Base: Many crypto traders and enthusiasts who were previously unable to access Pi Coin could start investing, increasing adoption and market participation. Pi Network Ecosystem & Real-World Utility Beyond exchange listings, Pi Network’s real strength lies in its ecosystem. The network is developing utility-based applications that could revolutionize its use cases. Crypto trader Eniwealth ICT DON highlighted key upcoming events that could impact Pi Coin’s price. He noted that Pi Network’s transition to an open network phase is driving innovation. Projects like Pailot Services are emerging, allowing users to spend Pi on real-world transactions. Additionally, the recent reduction in Pi’s mining rate by 38.1% is making mining less rewarding. This shift could encourage holders to spend and trade their tokens within the network, further increasing demand. Simultaneously, the community members are anticipating further positive announcements ahead. For context, the Pi community eagerly awaits some major announcements during Pi Day (March 14, 2025), which can further boost the crypto’s appeal to investors. Besides, the community’s anticipation of the potential addition of Pi Coin to the US Strategic Reserve list has further boosted sentiment. Binance’s Cryptic Messages Spark Speculation Adding to the hype, Binance has posted cryptic messages on X that appear to reference Pi Coin. The ‘Binance Intern’ account shared a post reading, “If you’re reading this, you’re a real one,” followed by the Pi symbol (as shown below). Another post asked, “If your favorite project was a dessert, what would it be?” with a slice of pie emoji. Source: Binance Intern, X While these posts may be playful, they have fueled speculation that Binance is testing community engagement before a potential listing. The Pi listing on Binance, if happens, could set the stage for a price breakout. Can Pi Coin Reach $100? Pi price was up nearly 8% today and exchanged hands at $1.90, while its trading volume stayed near the flatline at $814 million. The crypto has added 4% gains in the weekly chart but recorded a significant decline from its ATH of around $3 recorded last week. However, with a growing community, increasing real-world utility, and potential exchange listings on the horizon, Pi Network is positioned for a significant price movement. While $100 may seem ambitious, market momentum and strategic developments could push Pi Coin toward this milestone.
