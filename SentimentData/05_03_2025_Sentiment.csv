However, analysts see signs of a rebound, indicating a potential bullish trend. SHIB is testing a horizontal support level after a decline amid a massive Shibburn of 5000%. Market sentiment suggests a possible upward movement, with a $0.00047 target in focus if buying pressure increases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Holds Strong: Is a $0.00047 Rally Coming? Crypto analyst forecasts a potential rally for Shiba Inu price as technical indicators suggest an upward trend. The price targets are set at $0.000085171, $0.000183312, and $0.000472905, reflecting a bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s dominance declines, SHIB could gain momentum in the market. The analyst highlights a positive technical outlook, signaling strong resistance and support levels for SHIB. If buying pressure increases, the price could reach the projected targets. Shiba Burn Rate Surges Over 5,400%; Whats Next For SHIB? Shiba burn mechanism recorded a sharp rise, with the burn rate soaring 5,440% in the last 24 hours. Data shows that 26,355,678 SHIB tokens were sent to dead wallets, significantly reducing the circulating supply. The latest spike in token burning reflects increased community efforts to enhance scarcity. The process involves sending SHIB to an inaccessible address and permanently removing them from circulation. A higher burn rate often indicates growing network activity, which could impact future price trends. Source: SHIBBURN SHIB Technical Analysis As of the reporting time, the Shiba price hovered at $0.00001310, showing slight gains of 0.08% in the past 24-hours. The Shiba Inu price is consolidating near support, with key resistance levels limiting upward movement. The SHIB reveals strong support at $0.00001, preventing further declines. Resistance remains at $0.00001405, with higher barriers at $0.000016 and $0.000018. If Shiba Inu price prediction breaks past $0.000015, it could push toward $0.000012. A rejection at current levels could send the price back to $0.000012. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish crossover. The signal line remains below the MACD line, but positive momentum could emerge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42, slightly recovering from oversold conditions. Source: TradingView To sum up, the SHIB price shows signs of recovery, with a potential rally targeting $0.00047. Strong support and resistance levels, along with a rising burn rate, could propel SHIB’s value higher, depending on market dynamics and buying momentum.

Imagine doubling your coins and gains instantly with a single move in the current volatile market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) has just thrown down the ultimate power play—a limited 100% bonus offer in Stage 14, turning heads across the market. Meanwhile, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is battling legal challenges, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making waves with a potential 118% rally. With all this action, investors are hunting for the best cryptos for beginners to ride the next wave of profits. Let’s dive into the details. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Bulls Squad Throws a 100% Bonus and a P2E Revolution The Bulls Squad is making history. BTFD Coin has shattered presale records, raising over $6.25 million and selling 71 billion coins. Now, they’re skipping ahead straight to Stage 14, burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13 to tighten supply. To celebrate, they’ve launched the game-changing LAUNCH100 bonus code, doubling every purchase and setting up investors for a staggering 550% ROI. But the hype doesn’t stop there. BTFD’s P2E game, which went live on January 1, 2025, is attracting players eager to earn rewards while having fun. Staking is another game-changer, offering a massive 90% APY, allowing long-term holders to multiply their holdings effortlessly. The referral program is another cherry on top— earn 10% in BTFD tokens when your referral code is used, making every investor part of the expansion. With presale prices currently at $0.00016, and post-launch projections targeting $0.0006, the investment math is simple. A $1,850 buy-in now would turn into $6,937 at launch, excluding staking or referral earnings. And with the LAUNCH100 bonus? You’d be doubling your coins instantly, securing a position in what could be 2025’s top-performing meme coin. How To Get The LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Navigate to the BTFD Presale Connect Your Wallet: Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the Bonus Code: Type LAUNCH100 in all caps, click apply, and confirm the message in your wallet. Enter Purchase Details: Select how many BTFD tokens you want to buy. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. No more hesitations. No second-guessing. The Bulls Squad is rolling, and early investors are already stacking their bags. If you’re searching for the best cryptos for beginners, this is the moment to lock in before the BTFD presale ends. Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Legal Drama Clouds Its Future Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) became a viral sensation in late 2024, riding on TikTok’s meme wave. However, its recent legal troubles have thrown uncertainty into the mix. The original creator of the meme, Phillip Banks, has announced his intent to take legal action over the unauthorized commercial use of his artwork. This has caused market hesitation, leading to a steep drop from its peak of $0.6575 to just $0.03015. While the community still supports CHILLGUY, legal disputes, and volatility make it a risky choice compared to the structured and transparent approach of BTFD Coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Profitability Bounces Back, Eyeing a 118% Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had a rough few months, with a 23% drop in the last 30 days. But things are looking up—SHIB’s profitability has bounced back to 40%, up from a recent low of 18%. Analysts are now predicting a potential 118% surge, fueled by growing adoption and token burn initiatives. With a current price of $0.00001271 and a trading range between $0.00001427 and $0.00001230, SHIB remains a strong player in the meme coin sector. However, for those looking for a fresh opportunity with immediate ROI, BTFD Coin’s presale and bonus incentives offer a more compelling entry point. Final Thoughts: BTFD Coin Stands Out as One of the Best Cryptos For Beginners! Based on market trends and investment logic, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as a top choice for early investors. Unlike CHILLGUY, which faces legal uncertainties, or SHIB, which remains tied to market cycles, BTFD is delivering immediate value through its 100% bonus, high staking rewards, and play-to-earn incentives. The Bulls Squad isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement, and those who join now stand to reap the rewards. The choice is clear. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned investor, the best cryptos for beginners come with the best opportunities. BTFD Coin is offering one of the most exciting presale deals of 2025, and with Stage 14 closing fast, now is the time to make a move. Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best cryptos for beginners? BTFD Coin offers a 100% bonus, staking rewards of 90% APY, and a P2E game, making it a top choice for early investors looking for high returns. How can I claim the BTFD Coin 100% bonus? Use the code LAUNCH100 when buying in the presale to double your coins instantly. Is Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) a good investment? CHILLGUY is facing legal challenges from the creator of its meme, adding uncertainty to its long-term viability. What’s happening with Shiba Inu (SHIB)? SHIB has recovered in profitability and is expected to surge by 118%, but it still remains volatile compared to BTFD’s structured presale model. Why should I invest in a presale like BTFD Coin? Presales allow investors to buy at a lower price, avoid market volatility, and secure higher returns before tokens hit exchanges.

From highs that get your heart racing to unexpected dips that make you second-guess your next move, the market can be unpredictable. But if there’s one thing that has remained clear through it all, it’s the growing interest in digital currencies and blockchain technologies. In fact, analysts have been speculating that the next big breakout might just be on the horizon. A coin that could redefine the game and potentially leave others in the dust. And while some past opportunities, like XRP, might have slipped through the cracks, the good news is—there’s a new crypto star rising fast, and it’s called Qubetics. XRP may have once been hailed as the next big thing, but it’s safe to say that it’s lost a bit of its shine due to regulatory issues and market struggles. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost in the crypto space. Enter Qubetics ($TICS). It’s got everything you’d want in a crypto coin—innovation, a real-world use case, and a presale that’s getting massive attention. More importantly, Qubetics aims to fix problems that other cryptos haven’t been able to touch. With a real-world asset tokenization marketplace, this could become the go-to platform for businesses and professionals across the globe. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy and why you shouldn’t miss out on this golden opportunity. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: XRP Is a Missed Opportunity If you were keeping an eye on XRP a few years ago, you probably remember the hype around it. Back then, it was often touted as the “future of finance” with its lightning-fast transactions and ability to bridge the gap between traditional banking and crypto. However, as time passed, the road ahead for XRP got bumpier. The lawsuit filed by the SEC over whether XRP is a security has caused a huge amount of uncertainty, and even with a recent court victory, the damage to XRP’s reputation has been done. While XRP’s market price still fluctuates, it’s hard to ignore the fact that many of its initial supporters are beginning to look elsewhere for their next big crypto play. Analysts have been making bold predictions about XRP’s future, with many suggesting that its price might never fully recover to the highs it once saw. For those looking for a fresh opportunity in crypto, XRP may no longer be the golden ticket it was once believed to be. XRP’s market struggles have opened the door for other projects to step in and potentially become the next “big thing.” For instance, while the market is crowded with hundreds of altcoins, few stand out like Qubetics. With its real-world application and a presale that has already raised over $14.5 million, it’s not hard to see why analysts are bullish about its future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: Qubetics Is Still Available Okay, so now let’s talk about the hot new contender—Qubetics ($TICS). If you’re wondering what makes this crypto different from the rest, you’re not alone. The thing is, most cryptos today are pretty generic. They promise the moon but rarely deliver real-world value. But Qubetics? Well, it’s bringing something to the table that’s been sorely lacking: a real-world asset tokenization marketplace. The potential of Qubetics is huge, and here’s why. It aims to solve a problem that most other cryptocurrencies can’t touch. The real estate, art, and commodities markets have been held back by outdated systems, and Qubetics is here to change that. By tokenizing real-world assets, businesses and individuals can unlock liquidity and accessibility like never before. Imagine being able to buy fractional shares of real estate, luxury items, or even a piece of artwork—all thanks to blockchain technology. That’s the magic Qubetics is offering. The Presale Frenzy And the presale? It’s on fire. Right now, Qubetics is in its 24th presale stage, having sold over 495 million tokens to more than 22,100 holders, raising more than $14.5 million. Currently, the $TICS token is priced at just $0.0976, but analysts predict it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale. That’s a 155% ROI. Not bad, right? And after the crypto presale ends, some analysts are predicting $TICS could soar to $1, a 923% ROI. But that’s not even the craziest prediction—after the mainnet launch, some experts believe $TICS could hit $10 to $15 per token. That’s a potential 5018% ROI. You’d have to be crazy to pass up this opportunity. If you’re still on the fence, let’s break down a few real-life scenarios where Qubetics will be game-changing. Imagine being a small business owner who needs quick access to cash but doesn’t want to sell off assets. With Qubetics, you could tokenize valuable assets like equipment, real estate, or even intellectual property and sell fractions to raise funds. That’s liquidity in a way that’s never been available before. Another example—think about an art collector who owns rare pieces but doesn’t want to part with them. By tokenizing the artwork, they could sell fractional shares to participants, turning a static asset into something that generates income without losing ownership. The same concept applies to high-end luxury items, collectibles, and even agricultural commodities. The possibilities are endless, and Qubetics is ready to bring these ideas to life. Why Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025 When you look at Qubetics, it’s clear that this is a crypto project built with real-world applications in mind. The traditional crypto market often gets bogged down by speculative trading, but Qubetics is focusing on utility. With its ability to tokenize real-world assets, it could be a game-changer for businesses and individuals alike. Moreover, Qubetics is entering the market at a time when the demand for blockchain-based solutions is only growing. Real-world asset tokenization is one of the most promising trends in the blockchain space, and Qubetics is positioning itself to be a leader in this sector. If you’re looking for a crypto that offers more than just hype and empty promises, Qubetics is the coin you should be watching in 2025. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics XRP might have been a popular crypto coin to buy at one point, but its future remains uncertain. On the other hand, Qubetics is offering something fresh, innovative, and potentially lucrative. With its presale already attracting attention and its focus on real-world applications, Qubetics is a coin that could be poised for massive growth. If you’re ready to take advantage of this opportunity, don’t wait around. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, and the price of $TICS is likely to skyrocket once the mainnet launches. Analysts predict an astronomical ROI, so now’s the time to get in on the ground floor. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers.

Deutsche Bank Expert Analyst Reveals His Forecast,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-there-be-a-rate-cut-this-year-deutsche-bank-expert-analyst-reveals-his-forecast/,"Escalating trade tensions amid new tariffs are forcing financial institutions to reassess their forecasts for the Fed’s monetary policy, with even the most hawkish analysts now conceding a rate cut in 2024 is not out of the question. Deutsche Bank’s economics team, previously the most hawkish on Wall Street on the Fed’s 2024 policy outlook, is facing a challenge to its forecast. While their official position is that the Fed will hold interest rates steady this year, Chief U.S. Economist Matthew Luzzetti acknowledged that the impact of newly imposed tariffs could significantly change that outlook. “You’re definitely starting to see some negative impacts from trade uncertainty in economic data,” Luzzetti said. “If that impact expands and shows up in weak labor market data, the Fed could cut rates this year.” But Deutsche Bank is taking a cautious approach, preferring to monitor the duration and scope of the tariffs' impact before revising its official forecast. Related News: Inside Information Leaks About Friday's Big White House Cryptocurrency Summit - Here are the Latest Information The uncertainty surrounding the trade environment was echoed by New York Fed President John Williams, who said it was important to understand the complex details of tariffs. “There is still a lot of uncertainty about how tariffs will evolve,” Williams said. He also acknowledged that tariffs would inevitably put pressure on inflation, affect market sentiment and potentially hinder economic growth: “Customs duties will have a certain impact on inflation. Customs duties will also affect market sentiment and drag down economic growth.” Despite these concerns, Williams maintained a generally optimistic view of the U.S. economy, citing the strong labor market and a gradual slowdown in inflation. “The US economy is in good shape and the labor market has stabilized. Inflation has gradually slowed,” he said. Williams also expressed confidence in current monetary policy, arguing that it is well positioned to adapt to changing economic conditions. “Monetary policy is in good shape and can be adjusted as needed. I don’t see any need to change interest rate policy at this time,” he concluded. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will There Be A Rate Cut This Year?

Backed by the positive shift in network activities, Cardano is now one of the most promising altcoins in the top 10 with bullish momentum as of writing. Amid the ongoing rebound, Cardano’s price has pared off some of its losses picked up from the volatility this week. Cardano Network Activity Sees Uptick According to data from Santiment , an ADA whale entered the market when its price briefly jumped to $1.13. The crypto analytics platform said this whale activity has been the most significant for three months. These whales represent transactions valued at $100,000 in ADA. Per the accompanying chart, as of March 4, the Cardano network has recorded 1,132 whale transaction counts. The Mean Dollar Invested Age came in at 529.05. In all, the network recorded 2,671 unique $100,000 transactions as the price jumped above $1.13 Alongside this uptick, Santiment noted that the sudden uptick in transactions worth $100,000 sparked a drop in the average age of Cardano now in wallets. This trend has an upside. It implies a jump in the number of ADA tokens in regular circulation. Cardano Price and the $10 Prospect At the time of writing, the ADA price was $0.9369, up 9.82% in the past 24 hours. The coin has traded in a very close range, from a low of $0.7684 to a high of $0.9502. Compared to an earlier ADA price analysis , in which the coin jumped 80%, the market remains cautious. However, the coin has the right fundamentals that might push it to a high of $10. Beyond the retained 35% growth over the past 7 days, Cardano’s open interest has skyrocketed by over 6% in 24 hours. Per Coinglass data, the coin’s futures open interest is 905.62 million ADA, worth over $842.04 million. A sustained boost in this metric might support the quest to breach higher price levels. ADA Price and ETF Catalyst The onchain enhancements spearheaded by Charles Hoskinson, like the push for Cardano to track government spending and the prospect of a Cardano ETF product, also boost ADA price sentiment. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Grayscale’s application for an ADA ETF. This acknowledgment places the coin on the list of altcoins awaiting official feedback from the SEC for approval or disapproval.

The lawsuit, filed in December, alleged Zelle’s parent company and the big banks often left victims of fraud on the instant payments platform to “fend for themselves.” Today, The CFPB told the court that it’s dismissing the action with prejudice, and without an explanation. The move follows the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken the agency by halting most of its operations, including investigations and rule-making. The administration’s stance reflects a broader goal of cutting federal bureaucracy, with Trump labeling the agency as a source of “waste, fraud, and abuse” that has harmed financial institutions. The CFPB’s lawsuit followed an investigation by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who alleged Zelle and the banks routinely fail to adequately protect and reimburse consumers who use the popular network.

Per the South Korean newspaper Maeil Kyungjae , Seoul-based regulators are keeping a close eye on developments in Tokyo before making a decision on crypto spot exchange-traded funds. South Korean Bitcoin ETF Approval Drawing Closer? The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been discussing Bitcoin ETF approval since late last year . However, the body has repeatedly expressed a lukewarm attitude to crypto, and Bitcoin ETFs in particular. The headquarters of the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service. (Source: Financial Supervisory Service/YouTube/Screenshot) The newspaper wrote that Tokyo has also “previously taken a tepid stance on crypto,” but has recently “taken steps” to approve Bitcoin ETFs. As such, South Korean financial authorities have “also begun to respond.” The Financial Supervisory Service, another top South Korean regulator, has reviewed the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA)’s crypto policy and has “shared its findings with relevant organizations” in Seoul, the media outlet reported. Major Japanese media outlets like Nihon Keizai Shimbun (aka Nikkei) has reported that the FSA is considering reclassifying crypto as an investment tool. Nihon Keizai Shimbun added that the FSA is also “considering” granting Bitcoin and altcoin ETF approvals. Mayor of Seoul is hinting at a presidential bid with the slogan ""KOGA"" https://t.co/VvKC5ogprt — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) March 4, 2025 FSA Moving Fast? The South Korean regulators think that the FSA’s silence on this matter lends credibility to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun report. The FSA wants to roll out a raft of crypto-related regulatory changes before the end of June. The Japanese government plan will then likely approve these measures before new legislation rolls out in the second half of 2025 or early 2026. Maeil Kyingjae wrote: “If Japan speeds up the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in this manner, it will be interesting to see how the South Korean government responds.” Lawmakers in the South Korean National Assembly. The FSC, some feel, is acting with caution due to the ongoing power vacuum in Seoul. President Yoon Seok-yeol remains at the center of a drawn-out impeachment case . Japanese stocks have been stuck for about eight months, languishing below its new high hit last July and failing to convincingly break the curse of the ’80s. https://t.co/JkUPonFHhN — The Japan Times (@japantimes) March 3, 2025 Lawmakers Not Focusing on Crypto For Time Being In response, members of the National Assembly have stated that they have paused all work on crypto legislation until the “impeachment crisis” is resolved. This has effectively left the FSC and the Financial Supervisory Service to fend for themselves on crypto-related policy. The Democratic Party – the largest party in the National Assembly – last year pledged to allow citizens the right to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Prior to his election in 2022, Yoon also made a number of crypto-related manifesto pledges. However, his government failed to deliver on many of these.

While Seoul is usually more predisposed to follow Washington’s lead on financial policy, some South Korean regulators were concerned that the US decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 may have been overly bullish. This approach has angered many South Korean financial chiefs , who claim that the FSC is allowing rival nations to steal a march on Seoul. Maeil Kyungjae pointed out that the FSC has recently announced that it would “not approve virtual asset ETFs in the near future, citing Japan’s stance as the main reason.” Kim So-young, the FSC Vice Chairman and the head of the advisory Virtual Asset Committee , said last month: “I have continued to say that I would carefully review [Bitcoin spot ETF approval]. Several countries have not yet approved them. Examples include the United Kingdom and Japan.” The FSA, meanwhile, is also thought to be working on further crypto reforms. These include possible changes to the disclosure laws governing the financial information of crypto firms, and a law requiring all crypto investment advisors to sign up to a national registry.

Two of the funds will enable lending. Canada-based Blockstream announced plans for the funds in January. One fund will underwrite Bitcoin-backed loans. Another will use U.S. dollars as collateral for purchases of cryptocurrency. The third will function like a hedge fund, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unidentified sources. Blockstream’s makes its asset management debut Blockstream confirmed the Bloomberg story on X shortly after it appeared. The funds will go live on April 1, and the firm will begin adding external capital on July 1. Blockstream announced the formation of two of the funds in January. They mark the debut of Blockstream’s asset management division. The company said the funds were made possible by a $210 million investment round led by Fulgur Ventures in October that was intended to accelerate the company’s layer-2 development. Funding from Fulgrum boosted Swiss crypto bank Sygnum into unicorn status. The Blockstream Income Fund will loan U.S. dollars against Bitcoin collateral and focus on loans ranging from $100,000 to $5 million, a sector the company says is underserved, according to the company. Blockstream has a network of Bitcoin-native startups and other businesses are beginning to establish Bitcoin treasuries that will create a pipeline of borrowers. The fund targets yields in the high single digits to low teens. The Blockstream Alpha Fund will combine uncorrelated strategies to provide “consistent, risk-adjusted outperformance within the Bitcoin ecosystem.” The Bitcoin Yield Fund is described on the Blockstream website as “coming soon.” Its post on X implied that all three funds would launch at the same time. The funds are intended for institutions and qualified investors. Blockstream loans will fill a wintry gap The crypto winter of 2022 diminished the liquidity available in the system with the closure of lenders BlockFi, Genesis Global Capital, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius, as well as numerous smaller lenders. The collapse of FTX also shook the entire industry. Today, some centralized and decentralized exchanges offer loans. Credit can be obtained from other decentralized finance apps as well. Blockstream also made a $75 million strategic investment in digital asset services and custody provider Komainu in January. The investment aimed to integrate Blockstream’s Liquid Network asset management platform into Komainu’s off-exchange margining & settlement solution to cut transaction times from hours to minutes. It will also integrate Blockstream’s HSM wallet, among other things. Blockstream was co-founded by its current CEO Adam Back in 2014. Back is a specialist in cryptography and one of the cypherpunks who originated Bitcoin and much-related technology, especially related to privacy and censorship resistance . Back has been identified as Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. He denies that he is Nakamoto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Meet BlockDAG’s Pioneers Chasing $600M—Is It PEPE’s Turn to Break Out?,https://thecoinrise.com/aaves-bearish-outlook-escalates-meet-blockdags-pioneers-chasing-600m-is-it-pepes-turn-to-break-out/,"What is the top crypto to buy in 2025? As traders ponder this crucial question, three distinct cryptocurrencies emerge as top contenders for the upcoming months. AAVE’s bearish outlook is deteriorating further, with its price falling back to $250 and an increasing volume of transactions ending in losses. Meanwhile, after a significant drop last month, Pepe has found stability at a crucial support level, showcasing strong PEPE breakout potential if it holds. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a top crypto presale, bolsters its team with the addition of five new leaders. Combined with impending exchange listings and rapid growth, BlockDAG’s future looks increasingly bright. Analysts are even projecting an impressive 30,000x return for BDAG holders in the forthcoming years as the presale quickly heads towards its $600 million target. AAVE’s Bearish Outlook: Mounting Losses Signal Troubles Over the past year, Aave (AAVE) climbed from $94 to $400 before slipping to $250. However, the short-term view for AAVE bearish outlook grows increasingly gloomy, as many transactions are now ending at a loss. For every dollar of AAVE traded, $0.88 is lost. This trend highlights the growing fear and uncertainty in the market, particularly as major holders start to offload their holdings. This AAVE’s bearish outlook is further exacerbated by dwindling profits for long-term holders, adding to the selling pressure and potentially driving prices lower. Pepe Breakout Potential: Essential Resistance Marks The Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential is gaining traction after a significant downturn. Having plummeted 40% last month and an additional 4% recently, PEPE is now steadying at a crucial support level. If this support remains intact, experts suggest PEPE could rebound, with the breakout aiming towards $0.000016. The next major resistance is at $0.11, and breaking past that could propel PEPE to $0.21, with a further potential rise to $0.41 if the upward trend continues. Whether the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential materializes will also depend on wider market dynamics, particularly the movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlockDAG: Meet the Team Driving 30,000X ROI Potential! BlockDAG has recently welcomed five new experts to its leadership team, each seasoned in their respective fields. Nicolaas David van den Bergh, the new Chief Marketing Officer, boasts over 20 years in media and digital industries, aiming to enhance the network’s global outreach. Marcus Xavier, now Head of Learning, will leverage his instructional design expertise to enhance educational resources. Robert Radek, the new Product Manager, brings over seven years of experience in blockchain and fintech to spearhead innovation across BlockDAG’s offerings. Joshua Sack, a mining and cybersecurity specialist, will enhance the network’s security protocols, while Liza van den Berg will oversee HR and operations with her 13 years of experience in IT recruitment and business development. Together, these new leaders, along with the existing visionary team, aim to scale BlockDAG’s blockchain solutions, driving the network towards its $600 million crypto presale goal. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting a massive 30,000X ROI in the coming years as the network’s ecosystem expands, with its presale already crossed $200.5 million and upcoming exchange listings on the horizon. Currently, with BDAG priced at just $0.0248 in batch 27, it represents the top crypto to buy in 2025. Early participants have already enjoyed a 2380% return, and with a 30,000X ROI forecast in place, this offers the most substantial crypto opportunity today. Identifying the Top Crypto To Buy in 2025! As AAVE’s bearish outlook worsens with rising trade losses and diminishing long-term holder profits, indicating further price declines, the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential remains robust, promising significant gains if current support levels endure. However, for those searching for the top crypto to buy in 2025 , look no further than BlockDAG. It stands out among other altcoins with its historic 30,000x ROI potential. Supported by a talented team and expertise across essential areas, the network is rapidly advancing towards a $600 million goal. Thus, the current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27 presents the best opportunity for maximum returns. However, with Batch 27 nearly sold out, swift action is essential to secure a spot before BlockDAG’s expected rise.

41166854,https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,1741132843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/41166854.jpeg,"Will Litecoin Hit the $500 Mark or Does Web3Bay’s 3,633% Growth Potential Offer More Value?",https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,"Litecoin has recently broken out from its stagnant price range, achieving a noteworthy 30% rise within a fortnight. This surge has ignited discussions among analysts about whether LTC could reach the $500 milestone. Despite its well-established status in the crypto sphere, Litecoin’s path to significant gains is clouded by a competitive landscape that includes newer, more agile blockchains. Concurrently, Web3Bay is drawing considerable interest for its potential to redefine e-commerce through decentralization. Still in its presale phase, Web3Bay has already secured over $1.6 million in funding, with projections pointing to possible gains of up to 3,633% for early investors. This begs the question: is it more pragmatic to bet on Litecoin’s steady climb or to invest in the explosive potential of Web3Bay? Let’s delve deeper to uncover which offers the most promising prospects for 2025. Will Litecoin Achieve a $500 Valuation? The recent rally in Litecoin’s price has rejuvenated investor confidence, propelling LTC past the significant $100 resistance level to a current price of $128. If LTC can breach the $135 mark, it might set its sights on reaching higher resistance levels at $175 and $240, which correspond to key Fibonacci retracement levels, hinting at the possibility of further gains. Another pivotal factor for Litecoin’s potential growth is the prospective approval of a Litecoin ETF in the U.S. The SEC’s acknowledgment of a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing and NASDAQ’s intent to list the ETF shares could usher in substantial institutional investment, driving up demand and prices. However, a surge to $500 would require an increase of nearly 290% from current levels—a feat Litecoin hasn’t managed since 2017. Given the rise of competitors like Solana and Avalanche, maintaining momentum to hit such a high target could prove challenging for Litecoin despite its optimistic short-term trajectory. Web3Bay’s Potential for a 3,633% Return While Litecoin offers a possibility for steady growth, Web3Bay’s promise of a high return on investment positions it as a potentially more lucrative endeavor. Web3Bay is innovating within the e-commerce sector by creating a decentralized platform where transactions bypass intermediaries, thereby reducing fees and enhancing user autonomy. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay aims to establish a more transparent, efficient, and community-focused shopping experience compared to traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay. The strong performance of the Web3Bay presale, which has already raised significant funds, underscores investor confidence. With the token priced at $0.005247 and a target launch price of $0.1959, early investors could achieve an ROI of 3,633% if the project reaches its expected valuation. Distinctive Factors Elevating Web3Bay’s Profile Tangible Benefits: Web3Bay is designed to solve genuine challenges in the e-commerce industry, suggesting a sustainable model for long-term growth. Advantageous Early Entry: The ongoing presale offers an opportunity for investors to acquire tokens at a minimal price before they are listed on major exchanges. Expansive Market Reach: The e-commerce industry, worth over $6 trillion, presents a vast field for Web3Bay to tap into with its decentralized solution, potentially removing costly fees and traditional barriers. Exceptional Growth Prospects: While Litecoin’s price might gradually increase, Web3Bay’s presale stage offers a unique chance for substantial returns in a shorter timeframe. Summing Up! Litecoin’s journey towards $500, though feasible, is fraught with uncertainties stemming from stiff market competition and the dependency on sustained institutional backing. In contrast, Web3Bay stands at a pioneering phase where the potential for extraordinary gains is markedly higher. As it carves a niche in decentralized e-commerce and continues to attract significant presale investments, Web3Bay represents an opportunity that is difficult to overlook. For investors who have previously missed out on early investments in major projects like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable chance to participate at the ground level for potentially transformative returns.

XRP was created to be used with RippleNet, a blockchain-based network designed for banks and financial institutions. With growing adoption and potential replacement of traditional systems like SWIFT, many are asking: Can the XRP price hit $1,000? Can XRP Price Skyrocket if Trump Endorses It as Swift’s Successor? RippleNet provides customers with payments that are both speedier and cost-slower than what SWIFT, the industry norm, has delivered for many years. XRP serves as a bridge currency to enable swift currency exchange without dependent pre-funded accounts, which grants it superior functionality over conventional payment systems. SWIFT and XRP continue to compete actively, which reveals the move towards innovative payment systems. SWIFT operates as an established payment system for over 10,000 banks worldwide through a correspondent bank network, yet it has served the market since its inception many decades ago. RippleNet resolves settlement transactions through blockchain technology while offering almost instant and inexpensive transactions to compete against SWIFT’s control. Ripple has recently introduced XRP as a major international payment solution after the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve endorsed the blockchain network. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch in March 2025 The latest price of XRP has seen notable fluctuations over recent days. As of March 4, 2025, the Ripple price is at $2.4, showing a surge of 1.83%. Most cryptocurrencies are struggling to recover after a day of massive liquidation. The top coin saw a strong rally earlier, reaching a peak of $2.83 before reversing its course, creating potential support and resistance levels that traders are currently eyeing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish trend. The MACD line shows bullish momentum, having recently crossed above the signal line, signaling possible upward price movement. The RSI is positioned at 58.46, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, but its price could experience volatility as it hovers in neutral territory. Looking ahead, the support levels for XRP are seen at $2.20 and $2.00, while resistance is currently set around $2.46 and $2.50. A breakout above the $2.50 level could push the Ripple price prediction towards its next target of $2.80, representing a potential 19% price increase. On the downside, if XRP fails to hold its support, the next level to watch would be $2.00. XRP Price Chart: TradingView To sum up the, XRP price hitting $1,000 is a big stretch given the current market dynamics. While the technology behind XRP offers significant advantages, replacing SWIFT remains a challenge. The endorsement of prominent figures like Trump could boost its profile, but substantial hurdles remain for Ripple to reach such a high price point.

These holdings are worth around $7.18 billion. Some of these wallets had been idle for six to seven years before unexpectedly reactivating in January 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Below Parallel Channel – Is ETH Collapsing To $1,250? Old Wallets Begin Moving Large Amounts The once-idle wallets did not remain quiet for long, crypto sleuth ZachXBT disclosed. More than $109 million in XRP transactions were registered, with cash going to prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Bybit. This unexpected activity has prompted doubts regarding the timing and purpose of the transfers. Some in the cryptocurrency world worry if Larsen lost access to the wallets and only recently regained control. Others suspect that the money changed hands a long time ago, possibly as early as 2013. ZachXBT remarked that it is unclear whether Larsen still has direct control over all of these wallets. XRP: Market Impact And Price Surge The timing of these wallet activations coincided with a key announcement by US President Donald Trump. He outlined ideas for a strategic cryptocurrency reserve that comprises XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. This revelation caused a sharp price uptick in XRP: from $2.23 to a peak of $2.93 and then to $2.60, translating to an 18% increase. Investors and traders paid attention, with some conjecturing that the value increase was connected to the wallet movements. Previous Transfers Add More Questions Larsen’s transactions have made headlines before. Back in September 2020, he transferred approximately 500 million XRP, worth $115 million at the time, to an unidentified address. He later explained that the move was to NYDIG for security purposes. Nonetheless, others in the cryptocurrency field suspected that there could have been other motivations, although there was no substantial proof to corroborate those assertions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Risk Factor Remains High, Crypto Analyst Notes What Comes Next? Discussions have resurfaced in response to recent developments. Is this just ordinary fund management, or is there something bigger going on? The answers are still unknown. As the XRP community monitors these wallets, speculation persists. Will there be other significant transfers? Could this have a further impact on the XRP market price? While no one can say for sure, one thing is certain: when billions of XRP start moving, people will know and start to make some noise.

Forty-nine crypto wallets belonging to Parsarad were sanctioned as well. Nemesis itself was shut down last year. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions on Parsrad and his wallets on allegations that Nemesis sold almost $30 million in illicit drugs between 2021 and 2024. The site had 30,000 active users and 1,000 vendors. OFAC sanctioned 49 crypto addresses along with Parsarad Nemesis also provided such services as professional hacking services and the sale of false identification documents. Parsarad used the site to launder cryptocurrency for its users. Parsarad, an Iranian citizen living in Teheran, collected fees from users that OFAC estimated amounted to millions of dollars during its operation from 2021 to 2024. He was the sole administrator of the site. “Parsarad sought to build — and continues to try to re-establish — a safe haven to facilitate the production, sale, and shipment of illegal narcotics like fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,” Acting Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said. Chainalysis said the 44 Bitcoin wallets designated by OFAC on March 4 received more than $850,000 between July 2022 and March 2024 and sent more than $1.6 million from them, apparently taking advantage of the recent Bitcoin price surge. Parsarad also had five Monero wallets. Nemesis was shut down in March 2024 when U.S., German and Lithuanian law enforcement seized its servers. Parsarad kept a low profile in Iran, since drug offenses there carry punishments up to the death penalty. According to OFAC, Parsarad was discussing the revival of Nemesis’ services with vendors who had been active on it. Other darknet marketplaces have been sanctioned OFAC said in its announcement that this was the latest of several actions to combat drug trafficking on the darknet. It sanctioned Hydra Market in April 2022 and Genesis Market in April 2023. Authorities also targeted Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato, which laundered $700 million in crypto for Hydra users. Genesis also used a third-party payment processor. Bitzlato founder and majority owner Anatoly Legkodymov pleaded guilty in the United States to operating a money transmitting business in December 2023. The first darknet marketplace was Silk Road, established in 2011 by Ross Ulbricht and closed down in 2013. The U.S. government seized 174,000 BTC in that case and still holds them. Ulbricht received two life sentences in prison in that case, but U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned him this year.

President Donald Trump is set to headline the event. The summit, which will run from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM, will be a roundtable discussion featuring key figures like CEOs, investors, and members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets (PWG). According to Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, the guest list will be smaller than initially expected, with approximately 20-25 attendees. Among the confirmed participants are industry leaders such as MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is also expected to attend.

This meeting will serve as the first of a series of events designed to replace the previously proposed “crypto advisory council.” Although official invitations were just sent out recently, the event is already generating significant interest. For those not included in the roundtable, a larger, invite-only reception will be held across the street from the White House, allowing the wider crypto community to participate in the discussions. The gathering has sparked intrigue, especially given the involvement of prominent figures in both the government and the crypto industry.

Today, the spotlight turns to Web3Bay (3BAY) , a burgeoning project that promises to revolutionize blockchain-powered e-commerce, mirroring the early potential BNB once showed. For savvy investors aiming to capture significant gains from the next breakout token, Web3Bay emerges as a prime candidate for 2025. Already attracting over $1.6 million in its presale, this crypto gem is drawing in investors eager to participate before it catapults into mainstream recognition. BNB’s Rise to Stardom & Web3Bay’s Promising Path Initially, BNB was a modestly priced token designed for transaction fee reductions on the Binance platform. As Binance expanded and innovated, BNB’s value surged, peaking at over $600. Similarly, Web3Bay is carving its niche within the e-commerce sector. Rather than serving merely as a transactional token, 3BAY powers a decentralized marketplace facilitating direct interactions between buyers and sellers—free from intermediaries. Like BNB, which thrived by enhancing its utility across Binance’s growing ecosystem, 3BAY is poised to capitalize as Web3Bay’s platform attracts more users. For those who recognized BNB’s early potential and capitalized on it, Web3Bay offers a fresh opportunity to potentially replicate those successes in the burgeoning e-commerce blockchain space. Web3Bay’s Early Presale Success: A Prelude to Greater Achievements Web3Bay’s presale momentum is a testament to its burgeoning appeal, having swiftly exceeded $1.6 million in investments. This robust early support underscores the market’s recognition of its vast potential. Priced attractively at just $0.005247 during its presale, Web3Bay positions early investors for an exceptional potential return, forecasting a launch price of $0.1959—a prospective return of over 4200%. Adopting a structured 28-stage presale strategy, Web3Bay incentivizes early participation, similar to the successful launches of BNB, Solana, and Polygon. Web3Bay is not merely another digital token; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem poised to transform e-commerce. By eliminating traditional marketplace barriers like excessive fees and centralized data control, Web3Bay hands power back to the users, significantly reducing costs and enhancing transaction security. Why Web3Bay Stands Out Amidst a Sea of Cryptos In today’s saturated crypto market, Web3Bay distinguishes itself with its utility-driven approach within a legitimate business model. As the Web3Bay marketplace scales, the demand for 3BAY is expected to grow, fostering a self-perpetuating cycle of appreciation driven by actual utility and user adoption. While BNB took years to achieve widespread acclaim, Web3Bay is already making significant strides in its initial phase, promising rapid adoption and integration into the e-commerce industry. This not only positions it as a unique investment opportunity but also as a potential leader in the next wave of crypto innovations. Is Web3Bay Poised to Be the Next BNB? Reflecting on BNB’s ascension from a simple utility token to a multi-billion-dollar juggernaut, Web3Bay is charting a similar course in the lucrative e-commerce domain. As its presale approaches completion and early adopters secure their stakes, the window for entering at a ground-floor price is narrowing. Those who discern Web3Bay’s burgeoning potential now could witness substantial gains as it progresses into its next growth phase. The critical question remains: will you join as an early investor in what could be the next big crypto success, or will you sit back and watch another groundbreaking story unfold from the sidelines?

Turning to the layer-1 protocol Cardano, the trader unveils that deep-pocketed investors accumulated over $345 million worth of ADA over the same time period. “The largest whales on the Cardano ADA network have bought 420 million ADA in [24 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X All in all, crypto whales pocketed $2.51 billion worth of XRP and ADA in just a day. At time of writing, ADA is trading for $0.86. Turning to the charts, Martinez warns that XRP appears to be flashing a head-and-shoulders pattern, a bearish reversal structure that may indicate the uptrend is over once the asset moves below the pattern’s neckline. “XRP could invalidate this head-and-shoulders pattern with a daily close above $3, potentially paving the way for a rally to $5!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will plummet to $1.20 if it breaches the pattern’s neckline at $2. As for Cardano, the crypto strategist says he sees ADA igniting rallies if it takes out a key resistance area. “Cardano ADA could be poised for a rally to $2.20!

With countless options out there, finding a project with both excitement and potential is a rare gem. If you missed out on Binance Coin, now is the time to pivot towards Arctic Pablo Coin. A revolutionary meme coin with an adventurous story, Arctic Pablo Coin is rapidly gaining traction, and you don’t want to miss this thrilling ride to financial discovery.

Imagine an explorer named Arctic Pablo embarking on an adventure across icy terrains and uncharted ice-covered islands, uncovering hidden treasures along the way. This isn’t just about a coin—it’s about sharing the thrill of an expedition. Arctic Pablo Coin, or $APC, isn’t merely a digital asset but represents the promise of a magical journey into unknown territories, where every coin signifies both a treasure and an adventure. The presale for Arctic Pablo Coin is currently underway, and there’s a growing sense of urgency—prices are rising steadily, and the current phase could end at any moment. As Arctic Pablo continues his journey, the excitement is building, presenting investors with a unique opportunity to join before the next price increase. The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has already captured significant attention, raising over $1.74 million in its current phase, known as Chillville (Stage 13). The presale price is currently $0.00007 per coin, with the listing price expected to reach $0.008, offering investors a potential ROI of 11,285.71%. What makes this coin unique is its compelling narrative. Each presale phase is tied to different locations and stories, blending the worlds of myths and top crypto coins to create something entirely new. From Atlantis to Chillville, each stage unlocks a new chapter in Pablo’s journey, where the real magic unfolds.

As Pablo pushes further into unexplored realms, the presale prices will only rise, making this your final opportunity to get in at a low entry point. If you’re thinking about making an investment, this is it—the stakes are high, and the rewards even higher. Binance Coin: The Crypto Giant That Revolutionized DeFi Before diving deeper into Arctic Pablo Coin, let’s take a moment to reflect on the success of Binance Coin (BNB). Binance Coin has become a household name in the crypto world. Originally created as a utility token for the Binance exchange, BNB has evolved into much more than just a means of reducing trading fees on Binance. It is now a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem and a key player in the blockchain space. Binance Coin is powered by the Binance Smart Chain, just like Arctic Pablo Coin, but its focus is on scalability and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Binance Coin’s success story is a testament to the immense potential of the Binance Smart Chain, which has gained traction because of its lower fees and faster transaction times compared to Ethereum. As more developers and projects flock to the Binance Smart Chain, BNB continues to play a central role in powering the top crypto coins ecosystem. The performance of Binance Coin over the years has proven that getting in early can lead to significant rewards. However, as with all crypto, timing is everything. If you’re looking for an opportunity that could potentially offer even higher returns, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be your best bet. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as one of the top crypto coins with significant growth potential. The unique narrative-driven approach combined with a deflationary token burn mechanism and enticing staking rewards makes Arctic Pablo Coin an exciting opportunity for investors looking for the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Don’t let this chance slip away—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of an adventure that could lead to great financial rewards! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin, and what makes it unique? Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin with an adventurous narrative, centered around an explorer named Pablo who uncovers hidden treasures. What makes it unique is its presale structure, which is divided into different locations as Pablo’s journey progresses. This keeps the story fresh and exciting for investors. How is Arctic Pablo Coin different from Binance Coin? While both Arctic Pablo Coin and Binance Coin use the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin with a unique presale structure, staking rewards, and a narrative-driven approach, unlike Binance Coin, which primarily focuses on DeFi and reducing transaction fees within the Binance ecosystem. Why should I invest in Arctic Pablo Coin now? If you missed out on Binance Coin’s early success, now is your chance to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin. The current presale phase offers a low entry point, and prices are set to rise as the presale progresses. Additionally, the coin’s deflationary burn mechanism ensures increasing scarcity, which could enhance its value over time. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s staking program work? Arctic Pablo Coin offers an attractive 66% APY staking program. By staking your $APC tokens, you’ll earn rewards as the coin grows. The more you stake, the higher your earnings will be, and all staked coins will be vested for a two-month period from the launch date. What is the token burn mechanism, and how does it affect Arctic Pablo Coin? Arctic Pablo Coin uses a token burn mechanism where unsold coins are permanently removed from circulation during the presale. This deflationary strategy helps increase the coin’s scarcity, which could drive its value higher as the supply decreases. The post Didn’t Get in on Binance Coin?

One day, you’re riding a rocket to the moon; the next, you’re left staring at a chart that looks like a ski slope. Case in point: Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), a meme coin that made a splash when it launched on December 17, 2024, at $0.06 per token. The hype was real, but today? PENGU is trading at just $0.0066—a crushing 89% drop from its debut. Ouch. Now, imagine being one of the early buyers who held on too long, watching their six-cent dream melt like an ice cube in July. That’s the reality of meme coins: timing is everything. And if you’re looking for the next big thing, you might want to shift your focus to a fresh contender— BTFD Coin , which is possibly one of the best new meme coins to join this week. The Pudgy Penguins Price Rollercoaster: A Reality Check Pudgy Penguins wasn’t just another meme coin; it rode the NFT hype train straight into the crypto market. At its all-time high of $0.0692 on launch day, early buyers thought they’d struck gold. But the excitement fizzled fast, especially for those who hesitated to buy the dip before the coin reached its ATH. The token’s market cap sits around $418 million today, with a circulating supply of roughly 62.86 billion tokens. The takeaway? Dips can be awesome opportunities to cash in big, but only if you spot the signs of a meteoric rise early. Luckily, you might still catch BTFD Coin before it surges to insane heights! Why BTFD Coin Is Making Noise (and Raising Millions) BTFD Coin is part of a bigger movement, backed by a growing community and a killer Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.00016, attracting over 11,200 investors and raking in $6.25 million so far. More than 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold, and the numbers keep climbing. But here’s the real kicker: BTFD Coin has an actual ecosystem. With a high-reward staking system and a fully integrated gaming experience, it offers real reasons to hold beyond the memes. What Makes BTFD Coin Stand Out? P2E Gaming Revolution – BTFD Coin’s game isn’t just another pixelated cash grab; it’s designed to be engaging, rewarding, and fully integrated into the token’s ecosystem. Community-Powered Growth – The Bulls Squad, BTFD’s core community, is made up of diamond-hand believers who see the long-term vision. Massive Staking Rewards – With an average APY of 90%, early adopters can compound their holdings while waiting for price appreciation. Deflationary Tokenomics – Strategic burns and a limited supply mean that as demand increases, scarcity kicks in, potentially boosting long-term value. The Numbers: What If You Buy BTFD Coin Now? If you invest $3,000 in BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll secure 18,750,000 tokens. If BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006 upon listing, your holdings would be worth $11,250—a 275% gain. But if it climbs to $0.006 (which isn’t far-fetched given the buzz), you’d be looking at $112,500. That’s a potential 3,650% return on investment. With Stage 14 of the presale wrapping up soon, the price is set to increase in the next phase. Translation? If you wait too long, you’ll be paying more for the same bag. The Verdict: Will You Catch the Next Wave or Watch From the Sidelines? Crypto history is littered with stories of people who hesitated and missed out. Pudgy Penguins had its moment, and while some early investors made money, many were left holding the bag. BTFD Coin, on the other hand, is still in its infancy—with massive upside potential. The window to get in early on one of the best new meme coins to join this week is closing.

Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week? BTFD Coin is gaining momentum due to its high-energy community, successful presale ($6.25M+ raised), and its P2E game that rewards players with BTFD tokens. Analysts predict a potential surge to $0.006, offering a 3650% ROI for early investors. How did Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU coin rise in value after its ICO? Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU started as a niche meme coin but skyrocketed in value due to strong community backing, NFT success, and its rapid expansion into Web3 projects. It saw a multi-fold increase post-ICO, making early investors significant profits. How much could a $3,000 investment in BTFD Coin be worth if it reaches its predicted highs? At the current presale price of $0.00016, $3,000 would buy 18.75 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 at launch, that investment would be worth $11,250. If it moons to $0.006, it could skyrocket to $112,500!

PI Network Posts Profits as CoinMarketCap Listing Nullifies Bearish Headwinds Pi Network, a mobile-minable cryptocurrency, has long faced challenges due to anti-money laundering (AML) concerns and regulatory roadblocks. Trading was largely confined to P2P and OTC markets, limiting its mainstream adoption. However, shifting U.S. regulatory policies under the Trump administration have sparked renewed interest in Pi Network, paving the way for listings on top exchanges like Bitget. PI Network (PI) Listed on CoinMarketCap | March 4 Pi Coin secured a crucial listing on CoinMarketCap on Tuesday, marking a significant milestone for the project. This development has amplified demand and enhanced visibility, attracting new investors to the network. At press time, Pi Coin trades above $1.74 with a $12.1 billion market cap, posting a 3% gain. Notably, PI is the only cryptocurrency among the top 20 to remain in profit amid market-wide liquidations triggered by Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Increased Trader Activity, Nullifies Impact of Market Liquidations Ahead of March 17 Migration Deadline PI Network is currently undergoing a crucial migration process. Last week, the team confirmed in a blog post that March 17 is the final deadline for users to migrate their holdings. Those who fail to comply risk losing access to a significant portion of their PI assets. Crypto Market Liquidations Cross $1 billion on March 4, 2025 | Coinglass With less than two weeks remaining, network activity has surged. Previously inactive traders are now migrating their coins, driving heightened transaction volumes. Supporting this trend, PI’s hourly chart shows consistently elevated trading volumes, even as the broader crypto market experienced over $1 billion derivatives positions liquidated following Trump’s tariff confirmation on Monday, according to Coinglass data. As PI Network navigates this critical transition period, market participants remain watchful of its next major move, particularly with speculation surrounding a Binance listing. PI Coin Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $10 as Market Momentum Shifts PI Coin price is consolidating near $1.78, with early signs of a potential breakout as volatility contracts. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, signaling an impending move, while price action hovers near the mid-band at $1.74. A decisive push above the upper Bollinger Band resistance at $1.90 could fuel a strong rally toward the psychological $2 level, with extended targets aligning with a bullish breakout scenario toward $10 in the long term. The Parabolic SAR indicator has flattened, suggesting a shift in trend dynamics. A confirmed breakout above $1.90 with rising volume could validate bullish momentum, targeting previous swing highs. Meanwhile, the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator shows a battle between buyers and sellers. The green zone signals emerging bullish strength, but the broader downtrend remains unbroken unless bulls maintain support above $1.74. PI Coin Price Forecast On the bearish side, failure to reclaim $1.90 could trigger renewed selling pressure, with downside risks toward $1.58 and $1.54. A drop below these levels would expose PI Coin to further weakness, potentially revisiting lower liquidity zones. However, as long as price stabilizes above key supports and buying pressure builds, bulls may reclaim control and set their sights on higher targets, with $10 remaining a long-term bullish objective.

During the previous week Shibas Inu lost more than 10% of its value as its February market crash exceeded 30%. The cryptocurrency faces imminent danger as two vital support zones exist at $0.000012 and $0.0000094. The experts predict that breaking below $0.000012 in value will send SHIB plummeting 23% to $0.0000094. The current struggles of SHIB cause investors to shift their focus toward projects that merge innovative concepts with practical utility which leads them to inquire about alternative options like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Shiba Inu’s Market Position The recent performance of Shiba Inu directly follows changing conditions across the crypto market. During early February SHIB reached its all-time high of $0.00001964 before dropping to $0.0000123 thus eliminating months of market growth. The Relative Strength Index stands at 45.68 which suggests that the market currently falls outside the ranges of both overbought and oversold. The indicator analysis of Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) maintains a position beneath its signal line which suggests that bearish forces are active in the market. SHIB faces recovery barriers at $0.00001405 because Bitcoin maintains a low correlation of 0.79 with other cryptocurrencies which leaves SHIB without support from market trends. The prospects of achieving a 1000% price increase become elusive because of a lack of catalysts to boost market demand. SHIB’s re-entry into the top-10 market cap requires strong resistance to technical impediments while generating renewed market enthusiasm which seems unlikely due to present risk awareness patterns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gains Momentum During Shiba Inu’s market instability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) charges ahead with its second presale stage which gathers $2 million from new holders that exceed 3,800 users. MUTM is launching its price increase from $0.015 to $0.02 in the following stage while maintaining a current cost of $0.015 which gives all investors a 33% boost. Structured tokenomics outline a $0.06 listing price, locking in a 300% return for current participants. Beyond presale gains, projections suggest MUTM could reach $3.50 post-launch—a 233x surge from today’s price. Presale Demand Intensifies The presale performance of Mutuum Finance derives from its dual-lending mechanism together with built-in purchase motive applications. Users receive interest-bearing mtTokens (for instance mtETH) by depositing their assets including ETH or DAI through Mutuum Finance. These tokens gain value during the time period. Through these tokens the platform supports decentralized borrowing function while suppliers can earn dynamic yields from liquidity pools. The built-in peer-to-peer lending mechanism expands utility by allowing users to trade non-standard assets which include meme coins. The income generated from loan activities allows MUTM to conduct continuous buybacks which distribute the tokens back to staking participants. The continuous demand creation together with anti-abuse features becomes a self-strengthening system. The strategy augments its goal of creating urgency because the presale slots decrease simultaneously with the implementation of a $100,000 giveaway for initial participants. Mutuum Finance gives priority to systemic financial stability instead of hyperactivity which characterizes meme coins. The lending mechanism in Mutuum Finance operates under a loan requirements design that incorporates excess collateral as a safety measure for lenders. Variable interest rates modify according to market assessments to create balance between risks and gains. Security concerns related to newer projects are resolved by conducting third-party audits on smart contracts used by Mutuum Finance. Long-term planning reaches its peak through token allocation methods. Scarcely thirty-five percent (35%) receives diverted funds from supply to offer trading post-launch liquidity benefits. MUTM operates under protection from sudden market fluctuations since funds for partnerships and development and reserves occupy distinct sections of its supply. Shiba Inu faces technical challenges alongside declining momentum in its journey toward achieving higher price appreciation of 1000%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates DeFi technology with strategic project growth to establish itself as an excellent investment option. Early investors who purchase in presale periods achieve immediate profits as well as joining long-term successful ventures featuring robust demand. The upcoming price hike will decrease the available opportunity time. Mutuum Finance’s presale phase 2 offers one of the lowest prices before exchange listings. At $0.015, the token bridges accessibility with exponential potential. Join 3,800 holders and position for gains up to 300% at launch—or beyond.

Solana Realized Profit Registered A Sharp Spike Yesterday According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Realized Profit observed a huge spike for Solana recently. The “Realized Profit” here refers to an indicator that, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total amount of profit that the investors are ‘realizing’ through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold on the blockchain to see what price it was transacted at prior to this. If this previous selling price for any coin was more than the current spot price, then that particular token’s sale is leading to profit realization. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Range The Next Key Resistance, Analytics Firm Says The Realized Profit takes the difference between the two prices to calculate the exact amount of profit involved in the transaction and sums it up for sales across the network. In the context of the current topic, the usual Realized Profit isn’t the metric of interest, but rather a derivative form known as the Realized Profit by Age. This indicator basically tells us about how the SOL profit-taking is distributed among the various coin age bands. An “age band” is a time-range within which coins part of the band were last moved. The 1-week to 1-month age band, for instance, refers to the part of the supply that was last involved in a transfer between one week and one month ago. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Solana Realized Profit by Age over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the aggregated Solana Realized Profit observed a huge spike on Monday following the recovery in the cryptocurrency’s price toward the $180 mark. The sharp rally in the coin came after United States President Donald Trump announced a Crypto Strategic Reserve that is going to include five digital assets, one of which is SOL. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As Bitcoin & Altcoins Bounce Back It would appear the investors were keen to cash in on this opportunity, as the SOL Realized Profit shot up to an hourly value of over $257 million, making the profit-taking event one of the largest in the last couple of months. Interestingly, as the chart displays, 99% of the aggregated profit realization (around $255 million) came from the 1-day to 1-week age band alone. This would suggest that the profit-taking spree was almost entirely due to investors who bought during last week’s dip, capitalizing on their quick gains. SOL Price Solana has crashed following the profit-taking selloff as its price has returned back to $136.

Despite a recent drop from $98,000 to $96,000, many experts maintain that BTC is on course for its next upward move. Last month’s record high of $109,114.88 has fueled speculation that the next milestone will be $116,652, with long-term projections ranging between $150,000 and $200,000. While Bitcoin remains the leading force in the crypto market, those seeking higher returns are turning their attention to budget-friendly altcoins that offer substantial growth potential. Two stand out as top contenders before Bitcoin’s anticipated rally: Web3Bay (3BAY) and Sonic (SONIC). Both remain priced under $1, making them accessible options for investors aiming to optimize their portfolios before the next major market upswing. Bitcoin’s Projected Move: Will It Break Past Six Figures? The recent decline to $96,000 may have unsettled some traders, yet market analysts see this as a routine correction before Bitcoin continues its upward trend. With a previous all-time high of $109,114.88 confirming its bullish outlook, the focus now shifts to whether BTC can surpass $113,000 to $116,000. This expectation is driven by historical market behavior, increased institutional involvement, and the rising demand for Bitcoin ETFs. On-chain data suggests significant whale accumulation, reinforcing the belief that another upward movement is approaching. Some experts anticipate Bitcoin reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 in the coming months, cementing its status as the dominant digital asset. Despite Bitcoin’s potential, its high price limits the ability of smaller investors to capitalize on its growth. As a result, the strongest opportunities lie in lower-market-cap altcoins with significant room for appreciation—making Web3Bay and Sonic particularly compelling options. Web3Bay (3BAY): Positioned for a 3,633% Surge Web3Bay is rapidly gaining traction in the crypto sector due to its decentralized approach to e-commerce. Unlike centralized platforms such as Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay operates on blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries, reducing transaction fees, and granting users greater control over their purchases. This model has driven high demand for its native token, 3BAY, which has already surpassed $1.5 million in presale funding. Investors are drawn to its real-world application within the $6 trillion global e-commerce market, offering an alternative to centralized platforms known for high fees and restrictive policies. Currently, 3BAY is priced at $0.005247, yet its anticipated launch valuation of $0.1959 suggests a potential return of 3,633% for early participants. The presale follows a structured 28-stage system, where each stage raises the token price, meaning that early investors have the most significant opportunity to benefit before 3BAY enters mainstream trading. Web3Bay stands apart due to its combination of practical use and high growth potential. Many altcoins struggle to retain value due to a lack of adoption, but Web3Bay directly addresses a major inefficiency in online commerce, positioning it as a strong candidate for sustained success. Sonic (SONIC): A Low-Cap Altcoin Gaining Market Momentum Sonic is another budget-friendly altcoin drawing increased interest. Built with an emphasis on speed, efficiency, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Sonic offers an alternative to conventional financial systems while delivering rapid transaction speeds. SONIC’s recent 12% price increase has captured investor attention, signaling growing momentum. With a relatively low market capitalization and early-stage adoption, it has ample room for further price appreciation, making it an appealing choice for investors aiming to capitalize on an upcoming altcoin rally. What sets Sonic apart is its extensive utility within the DeFi ecosystem. Its integration into various blockchain projects—including cross-border transactions, yield farming, and decentralized applications—indicates rising demand for SONIC tokens. This increasing adoption is expected to drive further price growth in the months ahead. Why Web3Bay & Sonic Are Worth Considering Before Bitcoin’s Next Move While Bitcoin is likely to achieve new price milestones, altcoins with high growth potential remain the most viable options for maximizing returns. Web3Bay and Sonic offer strong investment potential at low entry points, making them attractive ahead of Bitcoin’s next move toward six figures. Web3Bay’s projected 3,633% return, supported by its expanding presale and blockchain-based e-commerce model, highlights its position as one of the most promising projects of 2025. Meanwhile, Sonic’s role in the growing DeFi market and its increasing adoption provide additional expansion opportunities. By securing positions in these altcoins before Bitcoin’s next rally, investors can position their portfolios for significant gains. With Bitcoin expected to break past $116,000 and potentially reach new highs, now presents an opportunity to consider altcoins poised for substantial price movement.

The summit, led by AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, replaces the now-terminated “crypto council” that Former President Donald Trump once promised. Formal invites started going out Tuesday, with confirmed attendees such as Strategy’s Michael Saylor, Multicoin Capital’s Kyle Samani, and Paradigm’s Matt Huang. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev even teased that he would be there, along with Coinbase and Kraken, who said their CEOs, Brian Armstrong and Arjun Sethi, would attend. The White House summit is expected to serve as a key forum for shaping future crypto regulations. Exclusive Summit limits attendance as White House shifts crypto strategy According to reports , the White House Crypto Summit will have a smaller-than-expected guest list featuring government officials from the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. A larger reception is planned nearby for those not invited to the roundtable. Amid increasing infighting within the industry and overwhelming demand for seats, the Trump administration pivoted to a more permanent crypto council. Instead, the White House will convene crypto summits periodically to meet with leaders. With critical regulatory decisions on the horizon, the event is seen as a sign of things to come for the administration’s approach to digital assets. Saylor pushes Bitcoin strategy as institutions and states boost investments Michael Saylor recently called for the U.S. to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, describing it as the “greatest economic program of the 21st century.” Saylor also said that the U.S.’s ownership of 10–20% of the Bitcoin network could be used to lower the national debt. Despite concerns about the sustainability of the Bitcoin acquisition plan, large financial institutions continue to invest in the company through buying shares or fixed-income securities. According to a Feb. 6 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.6 trillion in management assets, increased its Strategy stake to 5%. BlackRock’s filing came one day after MicroStrategy rebranded to Strategy and adopted a Bitcoin-themed marketing scheme to reflect its core focus. A dozen US states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin, currently hold Strategy stock as part of their pension programs or treasury funds. California’s State Teachers’ Retirement Fund had the largest exposure among the 12 state funds, holding nearly $83 million in Strategy stock. The California Public Employees Retirement System was close behind, which manages state employee pensions and holds approximately $76.7 million in Strategy shares. On Feb. 20, Strategy announced a $2 billion convertible note offering, its latest corporate securities move to fund additional Bitcoin purchases.

Qubetics, Cardano, and Ethereum are in the spotlight, each offering unique value. Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain interoperability, Cardano has staged a remarkable rally, and Ethereum is facing a crucial support test after a steep decline. With crypto presales gaining traction and altcoin season approaching, which projects holds the strongest potential for long-term gains? Qubetics: Solving Blockchain’s Biggest Problem—Interoperability Most blockchain networks today operate in isolation, making cross-chain transactions and seamless data exchange difficult. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralized applications (dApps), financial services, and enterprise blockchain adoption. Qubetics aims to eliminate these barriers by building a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple blockchain ecosystems. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and interoperability, Qubetics aims to become a critical bridge for developers, enterprises, and users navigating the decentralized world. The Qubetics presale is seeing rapid investor demand, surpassing $14.5 million as $TICS trades at $0.0976 in Stage 24. With 495 million tokens already distributed to 22,100+ investors, the project is moving toward its final presale stages. Analysts anticipate $TICS hitting $0.25 before exchange listings, offering a 155.93% ROI for early investors. Those investing $100 at today’s price would receive 1,023.72 tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 post-mainnet launch, that investment would yield an ROI of 10,136.92%, positioning Qubetics as one of the top crypto presales with long-term profit potential. Ethereum: Will ETH Hold the $2,400 Support Level? Ethereum has sharply declined, falling 12.22% over the past week to $2,438.47. Despite its $294.04 billion market cap, the second-largest cryptocurrency has broken key support levels, signaling potential downside risks. With trading volume surging 160.73% to $37.49 billion, sellers have taken control of the market. Ethereum’s downtrend began on February 24, and the price is now hovering just above a crucial $2,400 support zone. If Ethereum fails to hold this level, analysts warn that it could drop to $2,200, creating uncertainty for investors. However, if ETH rebounds from support, it could offer a strong recovery play for those eyeing long-term growth. Cardano: Defying the Market with a Massive 39.93% Rally Cardano (ADA) has outperformed the broader market, surging 39.93% in the past seven days to $1.06. This impressive rally has reignited investor interest, pushing Cardano’s market cap to $37.43 billion and solidifying its position in the top 10 cryptos. ADA’s trading volume exploded by 1,396.90% to $8.79 billion, with technical indicators confirming a strong breakout on March 1. Cardano successfully broke multiple resistance levels, demonstrating bullish momentum with minimal retracement. However, some analysts caution that momentum indicators show overbought conditions, meaning a short-term cooldown could occur before another push higher. If ADA sustains its breakout trend, it could continue rallying toward higher price targets, making it one of the best crypto investments for 2025. Which is the Best crypto investment? Qubetics, Ethereum, and Cardano each present strong investment opportunities, but their appeal depends on an investor’s risk appetite and time horizon. Qubetics stands out as the most explosive opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential, with its crypto presale nearing completion and a possible 10x–15x price surge post-mainnet launch. It is a key player in blockchain interoperability, solving a major industry problem that could drive mass adoption. Cardano’s bullish price action has solidified it as a top-performing altcoin, proving that investor confidence remains strong. Despite its recent pullback, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency, with institutional backing and massive network utility. With 2025 shaping up to be a pivotal year for crypto, these three projects are proving that the biggest opportunities often emerge in times of transformation. Whether investors seek massive gains in Qubetics, stability in Ethereum, or momentum-driven growth in Cardano, each of these cryptos offers a compelling case for being among the best crypto investments of the year. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs How does Qubetics improve blockchain interoperability? Qubetics acts as a Web3-aggregated chain, allowing seamless cross-chain transactions, asset transfers, and data sharing. This eliminates barriers between blockchain networks, making it easier for developers and users to interact across ecosystems. Will Ethereum recover after its recent drop? Ethereum is currently testing the $2,400 support level. If buyers step in, ETH could stage a recovery. However, if sellers maintain control, ETH could decline further to $2,200 before finding stability. Can Cardano’s rally continue? Cardano has broken multiple resistance levels, and if trading volume remains strong, ADA could extend its gains. However, momentum indicators show overbought conditions, meaning a short-term pullback before further upside is possible.

33767162,[object Object],1741141810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"20% of Stolen Bybit Funds ‘Gone Dark,’ Says CEO—Here’s How",https://bitcoinist.com/20-of-stolen-bybit-funds-gone-dark-says-ceo-heres/,"Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, has provided updates on the recovery of funds stolen during a major hack on the exchange. The incident, which occurred on February 21, involved approximately $1.4 billion worth of cryptocurrency, making it one of the largest hack on a centralized exchange in the crypto market. The attack, attributed to the Lazarus Group, resulted in the loss of 400,000 ETH-related tokens and other assets. Zhou stated that around 20% of the stolen funds have “gone dark,” while 77% remain traceable, and 3% have been frozen. Rising Concerns Over Decentralized Protocols Bybit CEO Zhou emphasized that the upcoming weeks are crucial for halting the hackers’ efforts to cash out through exchanges, over-the-counter platforms, and peer-to-peer channels. He noted that the stolen ETH tokens from Bybit is being rapidly converted into Bitcoin and moved across multiple wallets. The hackers predominantly used the decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain, accounting for 72% of the conversion activity. This has contributed to record weekly transaction volumes on THORChain, which reached over $4.5 billion according to data from DeFiLlama. The heavy use of THORChain by the attackers has triggered internal debates about the role of decentralized platforms in facilitating illicit transactions . One key THORChain member, TCB, announced his departure from the protocol, citing concerns over the significant volume of stolen funds being processed. TCB remarked that maintaining a fully decentralized, permissionless system becomes challenging when it is heavily exploited for laundering funds. A temporary vote to halt Ethereum transactions on THORChain has been proposed, but no final decision has been made. In contrast, other cross-chain platforms are taking more immediate action. Chainflip, another decentralized exchange, temporarily halted its swapping services upon detecting the hackers’ activities. The protocol also announced plans for new upgrades to prevent stolen funds from passing through its system. These moves reflect an ongoing tension between preserving the principles of decentralization and addressing the practical risks associated with allowing unrestricted fund flows. Bybit Challenges in Recovery Efforts As aforementioned, Zhou disclosed that significant portions of the stolen ether have become untraceable. For example, $79,655 ETH was processed through a non-KYC exchange called eXch, while another $100 million worth of ether flowed through the OKX Web3 proxy. 3.4.25 Executive Summary on Hacked Funds:Total hacked funds of USD 1.4bn around 500k ETH, 77% are still traceable, 20% has gone dark, 3% have been frozen.Breakdown:– 83% (417,348 ETH, ~$1B) have been converted into BTC with 6,954 wallets (Average 1.71 btc each) . This and… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) March 4, 2025 Of this amount, $65 million remains untraceable pending further updates from OKX Web3. Meanwhile, the FBI has also urged exchanges and validators to cut off the Lazarus Group’s access , citing the group’s involvement in what it called the “biggest money heist in human history.” Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Crypto News|Bybit|crypto|crypto exchange|Crypto Market|Cryptocurrency|Cybercrime|Lazarous Group|North Korean hackers,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-05 02:30:10

As reported by Business Insider, the motion presented by Senator Ted Cruz, was approved under the Congressional Review Act on Mar. 4, indicating that both parties were against the Biden-era rule. Introduced in December, the IRS DeFi broker rule required DeFi platforms to report user data for tax compliance, thereby broadening the definition of “brokers” to include them. Since decentralized platforms do not hold funds or keep customer data in the same manner as traditional financial institutions, critics claimed the law was impractical. The digital asset think tank Coin Center referred to the proposal as “technologically unfeasible.” “The Biden administration did everything it could to stifle financial innovation in the United States,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said in a statement. “The Senate is working to undo these burdensome regulations one at a time to restore financial freedom for the American people.” The resolution must still pass the House of Representatives in order to be delivered to President Donald Trump for final approval, even after the Senate has approved it. In addition to being prohibited from enforcing the rule, the IRS would also be prohibited from enacting similar policies in the future if the rule were to become law.

According to the DeFi Education Fund, the Senate vote was the “first of many historic milestones in the regulation of digital assets in the United States.” This vote echoes previous attempts to remove Securities and Exchange Commission accounting standards for digital assets and continues a trend of bipartisan crypto-related legislation. The Senate’s ruling might lay the stage for more extensive regulatory reforms, since stablecoin and cryptocurrency market structure legislation is anticipated to be on the legislative agenda. A matching resolution has already been approved by the House Financial Services Committee, and a final floor vote is still pending. According to the White House, President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law as soon as possible.

Analyst Cole Garner Spots BTC Order Book Pattern For Next Big Move,https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-price-to-100k-to-70k-analyst-cole-garner-spots-btc-order-book-pattern-for-next-big-move/,"Bitcoin price rose 9% in the last 8-hours of Tuesday March 4 to reclaim the $87,000 level. Vital BTC trading indicators suggest BTC could struggle to hold the recent gains. Bitcoin (BTC) Retakes $87,000 as Market Sell-Off Subsides Bitcoin rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a turbulent 48-hour sell-off triggered by market fears as Trump announced commencement of 25% tariffs on US imports from Canada and Mexico. Investors had withdrawn capital from risk assets following the former president’s announcement on Monday, leading BTC to slump to $82,000, its lowest level in over two weeks. However, as broader market sentiment stabilized, Bitcoin swiftly reclaimed lost ground, surging 9% in the last eight hours to trade at $87,300 at press time. Bitcoin Price Action | BTCUSD 4-hourly Chart, March 5. The BTC/USD 4-hour chart reveals a strong relief rally, with price action bouncing off key support at $82,000 and reclaiming the critical $87,000 resistance level. The rapid move suggests aggressive short covering, as traders who had bet against Bitcoin were forced to unwind positions. However, spot market volumes remain moderate, indicating that fresh bullish momentum has yet to fully materialize. Despite the recovery, BTC price remains vulnerable to renewed selling pressure if macroeconomic fears persist. Failure to hold above $87,000 could see BTC retest support at $83,500, while a decisive breakout above $88,500 would position the market for a potential retest of the psychological $90,000 barrier. The next few sessions will be crucial in determining whether this rebound holds or fades into further volatility. Bitcoin Long positions holders booked 74% of total market liquidations While Bitcoin’s price rebounded 9% to reclaim the $87,000 level, liquidation data suggests that bullish momentum remains fragile. According to Coinglass , Bitcoin long position holders absorbed $370 million in liquidations over the last 24 hours, accounting for 74% of the total $505 million liquidated across the crypto derivatives market. This disproportionate loss among bullish traders signals that the rally may lack strong conviction, increasing the risk of a pullback. Crypto Market Liquidations, March 5 | Source: Coinglass Typically, when long liquidations dominate the market, it indicates that bullish traders were overly leveraged, leading to forced sell-offs that pressure prices lower. The BTCUSD 4-hour chart further supports this, showing a relief rally following a deep sell-off, but with no confirmation of strong buy-side continuation. This suggests that the recent price surge may be driven more by short-covering rather than fresh capital inflows. If Bitcoin fails to consolidate above $87,000, bearish pressure could send prices back toward $83,500 in the coming sessions, with $82,000 as the next major support. However, if bulls can regain control and push BTC above $88,500, the next critical resistance lies at $90,000, a level that could determine Bitcoin’s mid-term trajectory. BTC Price Forecast: Analyst Cole Garner identifies Bitcoin Order Book Depth Pattern Signaling Next Big Move Analyst Cole Garner identified another key Bitcoin price forecast signal alluding to long-term recovery timeline. As seen in the chart he posted on X on Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price action exhibits a strong correlation between deep bid-side liquidity and explosive rallies, as highlighted in previous accumulation phases. The lower panel, tracking order book depth cumulative sum delta, shows a fresh surge in green bid-side liquidity, historically signaling smart money accumulation before breakouts. BTC Price Forecast This pattern has preceded major bullish runs, and if history repeats, Bitcoin could be on the verge of another expansion phase. A sustained bid above $85,000 could trigger a breakout toward $92,000, with an extended rally toward the psychological $100,000 mark if liquidity absorption remains consistent. However, despite the bullish setup, the chart also reveals a historical cyclical reversion. Each liquidity spike was followed by a sharp contraction, marked by red sell-side dominance, triggering corrective retracements. If Bitcoin fails to hold support at $81,500, order book imbalances could shift bearish, opening the door for a pullback to $76,800. A deeper rejection below this level could expose liquidity gaps down to $72,500, risking further capitulation. With Bitcoin hovering at a crucial inflection point, the market’s next move will be dictated by whether bid-side liquidity converts into price expansion or dries up, triggering a reversal. Traders are watching order book dynamics closely, as smart money positioning suggests a major move is imminent. The post Bitcoin Price to $100k or $70K?

Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing bullish momentum, fueled by whale accumulation, but its success still depends on market hype. Avalanche (AVAX) is struggling near key support, with uncertainty looming over its next move. Then there’s Web3Bay (3BAY), a project revolutionizing e-commerce with blockchain—and it’s already proving its worth. Unlike DOGE and AVAX, 3BAY isn’t just another tradable asset—it’s a real solution to online commerce barriers. With a presale raising over $1.6M, 390 million+ tokens sold, and a projected 6,430% ROI at launch, Web3Bay is attracting early investors looking for substantial gains and long-term adoption. Avalanche (AVAX) Struggles at $25 – Will Bulls Defend Key Support? Avalanche (AVAX) is facing renewed selling pressure, slipping 3% to $25 after failing to hold its recent $27 resistance. The token previously rebounded from a five-month low but is now at risk of further declines. If $24 support fails, AVAX could drop to $21.2 or even $17.3, mirroring its August 2024 lows. Despite the current bearish trend, a strong bounce from support could trigger a reversal, with resistance at $27.2, $31.5, and $38 as key targets. However, low trading volume suggests market indecision, and a surge in volume could determine the next major move. Investors are watching closely—a breakout could mean big gains, but another dip could offer a strategic buying opportunity. If bulls regain control, AVAX could be gearing up for a strong recovery in the coming weeks. Dogecoin (DOGE) Gearing Up for a Major Breakout? Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a potential breakout, with large holders aggressively accumulating despite recent market fluctuations. Transaction volume has surged 40%, indicating rising investor interest. Analysts believe this accumulation phase could trigger a strong upward move in the coming weeks. Whales holding 10M–100M DOGE have amassed over $6 billion since November, signaling growing confidence in DOGE’s long-term potential. Currently, DOGE is holding strong support at $0.23, with key resistance at $0.35. A breakout above this level could attract both retail and institutional buyers, pushing prices toward previous highs of $0.48. With a growing holder base and rising community engagement, Dogecoin is positioning itself for a potential rally. As crypto sentiment improves, investors looking for high-upside opportunities may find DOGE an attractive bet before momentum fully kicks in. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Innovation Most online marketplaces are controlled by centralized entities that make decisions without user input. Web3Bay is changing that by giving power to its community. The 3BAY token lets holders vote on platform updates, ensuring a decentralized governance system. Web3Bay is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales of 2025, offering a groundbreaking decentralized e-commerce platform that aims to disrupt traditional online marketplaces. By eliminating intermediaries, Web3Bay allows users to buy and sell goods with full control over their transactions, avoiding the high fees and restrictions imposed by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay. Its multi-chain payment system supports various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and even PayPal integration, bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 commerce. With over $1.6 million raised and more than 390 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s presale is gaining momentum at an unprecedented rate. Currently priced at $0.00524 in Stage 5, the token is expected to hit $0.1959 at launch, presenting a massive 3,639% potential ROI for early investors. Whales have already poured over $200,000 into Web3Bay within 24 hours, signaling growing institutional confidence in the project. Security is another key advantage, with Web3Bay leveraging IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for tamper-proof data storage, ensuring transactions remain decentralized and censorship-resistant. As e-commerce giants face increasing criticism for high fees and centralized control, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the future of online shopping, making it one of the top crypto investments of 2025. Final Outlook While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to attract attention, their success largely depends on market sentiment and short-term price movements. DOGE’s whale accumulation signals potential for a breakout, but its long-term value remains speculative. AVAX faces resistance at $27, with a risk of further decline if support fails. These assets offer trading opportunities, but neither presents the fundamental transformation that Web3Bay (3BAY) brings to the market. Web3Bay is not just another token—it’s a real-world solution to global e-commerce challenges. By removing high fees, banking restrictions, and centralized control, 3BAY creates a seamless, decentralized marketplace. Its hybrid payment system, NFT expansion, and decentralized governance model set it apart from typical crypto projects.

This follows a day of intense negotiations with both nations, suggesting a potential compromise in U.S. trade policy. The move could scale back some of the recently imposed 25% tariffs. Right away, the largest tech stock ETF rose nearly 1% in late trading, and index futures bounced back from their lows. These remarks came right after the U.S. stock market faced sharp declines for the second day, driven by fears that Trump’s tough trade policies could spark a full-blown trade war. Specifics Not Revealed! The Cabinet secretary didn’t reveal the specifics of Trump’s plans but hinted that the president would be open to meeting Canada and Mexico “in the middle.” He also suggested that Trump would not completely remove the tariffs. “Both the Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they’ll do better,” Lutnick said Tuesday afternoon. Lutnick hinted that any deal would need Canada and Mexico to address on issues Trump has criticised. He noted, “The President is fair and reasonable,” but added that Mexico and Canada must “do more” before any relief happens. The comments came just hours before Trump was scheduled to give a primetime speech to Congress. Trump Threatens For EU Tariffs Trump has always defended tariffs as a negotiation tool, claiming that Canada and Mexico haven’t done enough to stop drugs and crime from entering the U.S. Now, with the economic impact being felt, the administration seems ready to adjust its approach, but not entirely. Tariffs on China began in February, and China retaliated. Trump then raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%, and China will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. farm goods starting Monday. Trump also threatened new tariffs on the EU, possibly extending the trade war to Europe. Impact On The Crypto Market The tariff announcement yesterday had caused havoc in the crypto markets as well with Bitcoin dropping over 9% to $83K levels, while Ethereum plunged 15% and altcoin saw a steep decline as well. Bitcoin is now trading at $87,723, up over 4% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin like Ethererum, XRP, SOL and Cardano have also experienced slight increase as they are up over 5%, 9%, 5%, and 22% respectively over the past day. The crypto market cap is close to $4 trillion today, with an increase of 4% in the past day. Crypto-related stocks also have seen gains: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is up 9.55%, Coinbase (COIN) is up 3.22%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) has gained 1.34%.

The first major resistance is near the $2,275 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,275 resistance might send the price toward the $2,350 resistance. An upside break above the $2,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,450 resistance zone or even $2,500 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,275 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,130 level. The first major support sits near the $2,080 zone. A clear move below the $2,080 support might push the price toward the $2,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,880. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

In his latest post on X, the analyst references historical price behavior, a potential channel formation, and precise technical indicators to suggest that XRP may be on the verge of a swift move toward the $27-$33 price range. The timeframe for this potential surge, according to his analysis, could be as short as 28 days if conditions mirror XRP’s 2017 bull run. XRP Price To Hit $33? Egrag opens his post by acknowledging the risk and difficulty of making time-based forecasts. “Sometimes, I throw myself under the bus with time predictions, but honestly, it’s worth sharing with the community! Even though I know it might backfire, I still give it a shot,” he writes. He also reiterates his broader philosophy: “Now, let me be clear—I never try to time the market because it’s nearly impossible. Instead, I follow the golden rule: ‘Time in the market is more important than timing the market!’” This balance between caution and optimism underscores the delicate nature of technical analyses in unpredictable cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: XRP Price Can Fall Further To $1.5 If This Level Fails To Hold The centerpiece of Egrag’s analysis is a potential weekly channel that he believes strongly resembles the price structure XRP exhibited in 2017. He points out that, during that period, the cycle leading from the channel’s inception to the final breakout lasted approximately 175 days. Within that timespan, the token recorded a rise of about 2,500% from the lower boundary of the channel. That surge culminated in a cycle “blow-off top,” a term used by traders to describe a rapid price climb followed by an even quicker reversal. According to Egrag, these chart features appear to be resurfacing now, with XRP showing signs of maintaining support above the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). “We’re seeing similar XRP price action today, with the 21 EMA closing above and only a minor wick,” he notes, suggesting that the token’s price is finding strength near a well-watched moving average. Such support, if sustained, can be an early indicator that bullish momentum is building. One of the most eye-catching points in Egrag’s chart is his projection that XRP could climb toward the Fib 1.618 extension level, where he places a tentative target between $27 and $33. He explains that, if 2017’s channel pattern truly echoes today’s structure, XRP may replicate a similar percentage gain and time duration before hitting that upper range. “If we apply this same pattern to the current market, XRP could surge to the Fib 1.618 level, targeting $27-$33!” he writes. He further suggests that this parabolic move “could happen within just 28 days,” based on his historical observations. Before reaching this high, XRP could first target the Fib 1.272 level at $8.38, followed by the Fib 1.414 level at $13.67. These are historically relevant Fibonacci extension points that traders often monitor as price advances in an uptrend. Related Reading: XRP Price Bubble Burst? This Pattern Suggests Imminent Drop To $1.1 In the immediate short term, XRP is currently positioned at the 0.888 Fibonacci retracement level ($2.23), with additional support at the 0.786 level ($1.57) and 0.702 level ($1.78). These levels suggest that XRP is consolidating within a structured Fibonacci-based pattern before an anticipated breakout. This 28-day forecast is arguably the most striking part of his analysis, reflecting a break from his usual reluctance to pin down short-term timelines. Egrag concedes that timing market moves is notoriously challenging but remains confident that reviewing past cycles can still offer valuable insights. “Even though I know it might backfire, I still give it a shot,” he remarks, acknowledging the inherent volatility and unpredictability of crypto assets. At press time, XRP traded at $2.32.

Sigel outlined three major proposals — SIMD 096, SIMD 0123, and SIMD 0228 — in a post on X on Mar. 4. These proposals seek to improve Solana’s ( SOL ) economic framework but have the potential to reduce validator revenue by up to 95%. Solana has several upcoming protocol upgrades, known as SIMDs, aimed at enhancing its technical capabilities and economic framework. These changes could help stabilize and strengthen Solana's position in the crypto ecosystem moving forward. Solana recently implemented SIMD 096… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) March 4, 2025 Solana’s SIMD 096, implemented on Feb. 12, redirected 100% of priority fees to validators, eliminating the previous system that burned half of these fees. Staking payouts increased as a result, but off-chain trading agreements between validators and traders were deterred. SimD 0123, which is currently up for vote, would further divert revenue away from node operators by requiring validators to pay priority fees to stakers. SIMD 0228, the most contentious proposal scheduled for a vote on Mar. 6, would modify Solana’s inflation rate based on stake participation. The network’s yearly inflation rate would decrease from 4.7% to 0.93% if staking levels stayed at 63%. This would lower token dilution but also reduce staking rewards, much to the disadvantage of validators. You might also like: Hamster Network hits 34,028 TPS, surpassing Solana and Aptos Validators are mainly concermed about the high operating costs required to run nodes. These include mandatory voting fees of 1.1 SOL each day (about $58,000 yearly) and hardware expenditures of approximately $6,000 annually. Since only 458 of Solana’s 1,323 validators own a sufficient amount of stake to turn a profit , smaller operators risk being forced out. Lowering voting fees has been proposed by several community members as a way to alleviate financial strain. Despite the controversy, Sigel maintained that reducing inflation would benefit SOL in the long run by lowering sell pressure and supporting the token’s value. Solana’s network activity remains strong. With $109 billion in February, the blockchain has surpassed Ethereum for the fifth consecutive month, demonstrating its dominance in decentralized exchange volume, according to DeFiLlama data . The current plans, however, might render operating a node unfeasible for small validators, which could result in even more centralization. Read more: What is Physical Bitcoin?

It is now eyeing to break the $2 mark. Pi Network has seen a major drop from its all-time high of $3, now trading around the range of $1.60-$1.70. Despite the broader market downturn, investor sentiment remains hopeful, with signs that a reversal could be on the horizon. The MACD indicator shows potential bullish momentum, but with the RSI still below 50, recovery may be slow until market conditions improve Adding to the bullish theory, the X account ‘Binance Intern’ tweeted some intriguing messages. The first tweet read, “If you’re reading this, you’re a real one,” followed by the Pi symbol. This is the first time Binance has directly referenced Pi Coin in this way. Could it be a joke? Maybe. But it sure looks like they’re giving Pi some attention. In another tweet, they asked, “If your favorite project was a dessert, what would it be?” and posted a slice of pie emoji. These tweets have been getting massive attention and this could be a way for Binance to gauge the Pi community’s interest. What’s next for Pi Coin? The big news is that Pi Day (March 14th) is approaching, and experts believe that’s when Pi Coin could be listed on Binance. If Binance lists Pi, it will put pressure on other exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com, and Gemini to list it too. Pi’s trading volume is huge right now and other exchanges will want a piece of that action. Pi Coin’s community is one of the strongest out there. People have been mining Pi since 2019, and many are holding onto their coins for the long term, even locking them up until 2027.

The asset’s latest price action shows signs of upward momentum, with analysts debating whether this breakout is sustainable. Meanwhile, on-chain data reveal a SOL whale transferred 494,153 SOL, valued at $71.95 million, to Coinbase Institutional, adding further speculation about market movements. Solana Price Attempts Breakout From Descending Channel In recent Solana price analysis, technical indicators suggest the asset is challenging key resistance after weeks of downward movement. A descending parallel channel has been restricting its price, but the latest attempt to break above this trendline has drawn attention from traders. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart showing Solana price moving past its downtrend resistance, targeting a potential rally toward $213. If confirmed, this move could indicate a shift from a bearish trend to a more sustained uptrend. However, analyst Seth maintains a cautious outlook, suggesting that Solana price remains within the broader channel, facing resistance at crucial levels. Source: X Whale Transfers 494,153 SOL to Coinbase Institutional Additionally, blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported a SOL whale moving 494,153 SOL, worth approximately $71.95 million, to Coinbase Institutional. Large-scale transfers of this magnitude often attract market attention, as they may indicate either selling pressure or institutional accumulation. If the transferred SOL is intended for liquidation, it could introduce selling pressure, potentially affecting the ongoing breakout attempt. However, if the transaction is related to over-the-counter (OTC) trading or institutional accumulation, it may signal increased demand, which could support further upward movement. According to recent Solana whale activities, SOL price might be headed for a breakout to $180. A whale’s $14 million accumulation eased selling pressure, supporting the recent rebound to $145. If momentum sustains, breaking the $170 resistance could pave the way for a SOL rally toward $180. Buyers Return as SAR and MACD Suggest a Breakout Meanwhile, Solana price technical indicators have also turned bullish, supporting the potential breakout. The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator, represented by the dotted blue lines, has shifted below the price candles, signaling a possible trend reversal to the upside. This suggests that selling pressure is weakening and buyers are regaining control, increasing the likelihood of a sustained price recovery. Source: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Histogram further reinforce this bullish sentiment. The MACD line has started converging toward the signal line, reducing the bearish momentum. Additionally, the histogram bars have begun turning green, indicating a potential crossover into positive territory. This shift suggests that buying pressure is building up, which could support an upward move toward $170 and possibly $180 if resistance levels are breached. However, historical resistance between $175 and $185 remains a significant test for the asset. To confirm a true breakout, Solana price needs to maintain high-volume closes above these levels. Failure to do so may result in a rejection, pushing the asset back into the descending channel. More so, the Solana network has outpaced Ethereum in terms of active users and transaction efficiency. This has lead to speculations that SOL price could hit $500 before ETH price reaches $5,000. With 73.4 million monthly active addresses compared to Ethereum’s 7.4 million, Solana’s adoption rate suggests strong upside potential. If this growth trend continues, analysts believe SOL could outperform ETH in the near term.

Ripple Lawsuit Continues: The crypto community is now eagerly awaiting the outcome of the ongoing Ripple case. Despite the SEC’s recent dismissal of cases against several cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap and Gemini among others, the lawsuit against Ripple Labs remains unresolved. Additionally, President Donald Trump’s recent announcement designating XRP, Ripple’s native token, as part of the U.S. government’s strategic cryptocurrency reserve has raised expectations for a favorable resolution. Ripple’s legal team has asked for a deadline of April 16, 2025, to submit their cross-appeal. This date is important because it could affect how the case moves forward. Experts believe the case could be resolved before this date, but no official updates have been given yet. The crypto community is closely watching for more clarity on the regulatory status of XRP.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|XRP|FIAT|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 04:13:11
