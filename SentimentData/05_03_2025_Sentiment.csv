However, analysts see signs of a rebound, indicating a potential bullish trend. SHIB is testing a horizontal support level after a decline amid a massive Shibburn of 5000%. Market sentiment suggests a possible upward movement, with a $0.00047 target in focus if buying pressure increases. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Holds Strong: Is a $0.00047 Rally Coming? Crypto analyst forecasts a potential rally for Shiba Inu price as technical indicators suggest an upward trend. The price targets are set at $0.000085171, $0.000183312, and $0.000472905, reflecting a bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin’s dominance declines, SHIB could gain momentum in the market. The analyst highlights a positive technical outlook, signaling strong resistance and support levels for SHIB. If buying pressure increases, the price could reach the projected targets. Shiba Burn Rate Surges Over 5,400%; Whats Next For SHIB? Shiba burn mechanism recorded a sharp rise, with the burn rate soaring 5,440% in the last 24 hours. Data shows that 26,355,678 SHIB tokens were sent to dead wallets, significantly reducing the circulating supply. The latest spike in token burning reflects increased community efforts to enhance scarcity. The process involves sending SHIB to an inaccessible address and permanently removing them from circulation. A higher burn rate often indicates growing network activity, which could impact future price trends. Source: SHIBBURN SHIB Technical Analysis As of the reporting time, the Shiba price hovered at $0.00001310, showing slight gains of 0.08% in the past 24-hours. The Shiba Inu price is consolidating near support, with key resistance levels limiting upward movement. The SHIB reveals strong support at $0.00001, preventing further declines. Resistance remains at $0.00001405, with higher barriers at $0.000016 and $0.000018. If Shiba Inu price prediction breaks past $0.000015, it could push toward $0.000012. A rejection at current levels could send the price back to $0.000012. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish crossover. The signal line remains below the MACD line, but positive momentum could emerge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42, slightly recovering from oversold conditions. Source: TradingView To sum up, the SHIB price shows signs of recovery, with a potential rally targeting $0.00047. Strong support and resistance levels, along with a rising burn rate, could propel SHIB’s value higher, depending on market dynamics and buying momentum.

Imagine doubling your coins and gains instantly with a single move in the current volatile market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) has just thrown down the ultimate power play—a limited 100% bonus offer in Stage 14, turning heads across the market. Meanwhile, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is battling legal challenges, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making waves with a potential 118% rally. With all this action, investors are hunting for the best cryptos for beginners to ride the next wave of profits. Let’s dive into the details. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Bulls Squad Throws a 100% Bonus and a P2E Revolution The Bulls Squad is making history. BTFD Coin has shattered presale records, raising over $6.25 million and selling 71 billion coins. Now, they’re skipping ahead straight to Stage 14, burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13 to tighten supply. To celebrate, they’ve launched the game-changing LAUNCH100 bonus code, doubling every purchase and setting up investors for a staggering 550% ROI. But the hype doesn’t stop there. BTFD’s P2E game, which went live on January 1, 2025, is attracting players eager to earn rewards while having fun. Staking is another game-changer, offering a massive 90% APY, allowing long-term holders to multiply their holdings effortlessly. The referral program is another cherry on top— earn 10% in BTFD tokens when your referral code is used, making every investor part of the expansion. With presale prices currently at $0.00016, and post-launch projections targeting $0.0006, the investment math is simple. A $1,850 buy-in now would turn into $6,937 at launch, excluding staking or referral earnings. And with the LAUNCH100 bonus? You’d be doubling your coins instantly, securing a position in what could be 2025’s top-performing meme coin. How To Get The LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Navigate to the BTFD Presale Connect Your Wallet: Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the Bonus Code: Type LAUNCH100 in all caps, click apply, and confirm the message in your wallet. Enter Purchase Details: Select how many BTFD tokens you want to buy. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. No more hesitations. No second-guessing. The Bulls Squad is rolling, and early investors are already stacking their bags. If you’re searching for the best cryptos for beginners, this is the moment to lock in before the BTFD presale ends. Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Legal Drama Clouds Its Future Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) became a viral sensation in late 2024, riding on TikTok’s meme wave. However, its recent legal troubles have thrown uncertainty into the mix. The original creator of the meme, Phillip Banks, has announced his intent to take legal action over the unauthorized commercial use of his artwork. This has caused market hesitation, leading to a steep drop from its peak of $0.6575 to just $0.03015. While the community still supports CHILLGUY, legal disputes, and volatility make it a risky choice compared to the structured and transparent approach of BTFD Coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Profitability Bounces Back, Eyeing a 118% Surge Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had a rough few months, with a 23% drop in the last 30 days. But things are looking up—SHIB’s profitability has bounced back to 40%, up from a recent low of 18%. Analysts are now predicting a potential 118% surge, fueled by growing adoption and token burn initiatives. With a current price of $0.00001271 and a trading range between $0.00001427 and $0.00001230, SHIB remains a strong player in the meme coin sector. However, for those looking for a fresh opportunity with immediate ROI, BTFD Coin’s presale and bonus incentives offer a more compelling entry point. Final Thoughts: BTFD Coin Stands Out as One of the Best Cryptos For Beginners! Based on market trends and investment logic, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as a top choice for early investors. Unlike CHILLGUY, which faces legal uncertainties, or SHIB, which remains tied to market cycles, BTFD is delivering immediate value through its 100% bonus, high staking rewards, and play-to-earn incentives. The Bulls Squad isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement, and those who join now stand to reap the rewards. The choice is clear. Whether you’re new to crypto or a seasoned investor, the best cryptos for beginners come with the best opportunities. BTFD Coin is offering one of the most exciting presale deals of 2025, and with Stage 14 closing fast, now is the time to make a move. Join the BTFD Coin Presale Now! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best cryptos for beginners? BTFD Coin offers a 100% bonus, staking rewards of 90% APY, and a P2E game, making it a top choice for early investors looking for high returns. How can I claim the BTFD Coin 100% bonus? Use the code LAUNCH100 when buying in the presale to double your coins instantly. Is Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) a good investment? CHILLGUY is facing legal challenges from the creator of its meme, adding uncertainty to its long-term viability. What’s happening with Shiba Inu (SHIB)? SHIB has recovered in profitability and is expected to surge by 118%, but it still remains volatile compared to BTFD’s structured presale model. Why should I invest in a presale like BTFD Coin? Presales allow investors to buy at a lower price, avoid market volatility, and secure higher returns before tokens hit exchanges.

From highs that get your heart racing to unexpected dips that make you second-guess your next move, the market can be unpredictable. But if there’s one thing that has remained clear through it all, it’s the growing interest in digital currencies and blockchain technologies. In fact, analysts have been speculating that the next big breakout might just be on the horizon. A coin that could redefine the game and potentially leave others in the dust. And while some past opportunities, like XRP, might have slipped through the cracks, the good news is—there’s a new crypto star rising fast, and it’s called Qubetics. XRP may have once been hailed as the next big thing, but it’s safe to say that it’s lost a bit of its shine due to regulatory issues and market struggles. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost in the crypto space. Enter Qubetics ($TICS). It’s got everything you’d want in a crypto coin—innovation, a real-world use case, and a presale that’s getting massive attention. More importantly, Qubetics aims to fix problems that other cryptos haven’t been able to touch. With a real-world asset tokenization marketplace, this could become the go-to platform for businesses and professionals across the globe. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy and why you shouldn’t miss out on this golden opportunity. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: XRP Is a Missed Opportunity If you were keeping an eye on XRP a few years ago, you probably remember the hype around it. Back then, it was often touted as the “future of finance” with its lightning-fast transactions and ability to bridge the gap between traditional banking and crypto. However, as time passed, the road ahead for XRP got bumpier. The lawsuit filed by the SEC over whether XRP is a security has caused a huge amount of uncertainty, and even with a recent court victory, the damage to XRP’s reputation has been done. While XRP’s market price still fluctuates, it’s hard to ignore the fact that many of its initial supporters are beginning to look elsewhere for their next big crypto play. Analysts have been making bold predictions about XRP’s future, with many suggesting that its price might never fully recover to the highs it once saw. For those looking for a fresh opportunity in crypto, XRP may no longer be the golden ticket it was once believed to be. XRP’s market struggles have opened the door for other projects to step in and potentially become the next “big thing.” For instance, while the market is crowded with hundreds of altcoins, few stand out like Qubetics. With its real-world application and a presale that has already raised over $14.5 million, it’s not hard to see why analysts are bullish about its future. Popular Crypto Coin to Buy: Qubetics Is Still Available Okay, so now let’s talk about the hot new contender—Qubetics ($TICS). If you’re wondering what makes this crypto different from the rest, you’re not alone. The thing is, most cryptos today are pretty generic. They promise the moon but rarely deliver real-world value. But Qubetics? Well, it’s bringing something to the table that’s been sorely lacking: a real-world asset tokenization marketplace. The potential of Qubetics is huge, and here’s why. It aims to solve a problem that most other cryptocurrencies can’t touch. The real estate, art, and commodities markets have been held back by outdated systems, and Qubetics is here to change that. By tokenizing real-world assets, businesses and individuals can unlock liquidity and accessibility like never before. Imagine being able to buy fractional shares of real estate, luxury items, or even a piece of artwork—all thanks to blockchain technology. That’s the magic Qubetics is offering. The Presale Frenzy And the presale? It’s on fire. Right now, Qubetics is in its 24th presale stage, having sold over 495 million tokens to more than 22,100 holders, raising more than $14.5 million. Currently, the $TICS token is priced at just $0.0976, but analysts predict it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale. That’s a 155% ROI. Not bad, right? And after the crypto presale ends, some analysts are predicting $TICS could soar to $1, a 923% ROI. But that’s not even the craziest prediction—after the mainnet launch, some experts believe $TICS could hit $10 to $15 per token. That’s a potential 5018% ROI. You’d have to be crazy to pass up this opportunity. If you’re still on the fence, let’s break down a few real-life scenarios where Qubetics will be game-changing. Imagine being a small business owner who needs quick access to cash but doesn’t want to sell off assets. With Qubetics, you could tokenize valuable assets like equipment, real estate, or even intellectual property and sell fractions to raise funds. That’s liquidity in a way that’s never been available before. Another example—think about an art collector who owns rare pieces but doesn’t want to part with them. By tokenizing the artwork, they could sell fractional shares to participants, turning a static asset into something that generates income without losing ownership. The same concept applies to high-end luxury items, collectibles, and even agricultural commodities. The possibilities are endless, and Qubetics is ready to bring these ideas to life. Why Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025 When you look at Qubetics, it’s clear that this is a crypto project built with real-world applications in mind. The traditional crypto market often gets bogged down by speculative trading, but Qubetics is focusing on utility. With its ability to tokenize real-world assets, it could be a game-changer for businesses and individuals alike. Moreover, Qubetics is entering the market at a time when the demand for blockchain-based solutions is only growing. Real-world asset tokenization is one of the most promising trends in the blockchain space, and Qubetics is positioning itself to be a leader in this sector. If you’re looking for a crypto that offers more than just hype and empty promises, Qubetics is the coin you should be watching in 2025. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on Qubetics XRP might have been a popular crypto coin to buy at one point, but its future remains uncertain. On the other hand, Qubetics is offering something fresh, innovative, and potentially lucrative. With its presale already attracting attention and its focus on real-world applications, Qubetics is a coin that could be poised for massive growth. If you’re ready to take advantage of this opportunity, don’t wait around. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, and the price of $TICS is likely to skyrocket once the mainnet launches. Analysts predict an astronomical ROI, so now’s the time to get in on the ground floor. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers.

Deutsche Bank Expert Analyst Reveals His Forecast,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-there-be-a-rate-cut-this-year-deutsche-bank-expert-analyst-reveals-his-forecast/,"Escalating trade tensions amid new tariffs are forcing financial institutions to reassess their forecasts for the Fed’s monetary policy, with even the most hawkish analysts now conceding a rate cut in 2024 is not out of the question. Deutsche Bank’s economics team, previously the most hawkish on Wall Street on the Fed’s 2024 policy outlook, is facing a challenge to its forecast. While their official position is that the Fed will hold interest rates steady this year, Chief U.S. Economist Matthew Luzzetti acknowledged that the impact of newly imposed tariffs could significantly change that outlook. “You’re definitely starting to see some negative impacts from trade uncertainty in economic data,” Luzzetti said. “If that impact expands and shows up in weak labor market data, the Fed could cut rates this year.” But Deutsche Bank is taking a cautious approach, preferring to monitor the duration and scope of the tariffs' impact before revising its official forecast. Related News: Inside Information Leaks About Friday's Big White House Cryptocurrency Summit - Here are the Latest Information The uncertainty surrounding the trade environment was echoed by New York Fed President John Williams, who said it was important to understand the complex details of tariffs. “There is still a lot of uncertainty about how tariffs will evolve,” Williams said. He also acknowledged that tariffs would inevitably put pressure on inflation, affect market sentiment and potentially hinder economic growth: “Customs duties will have a certain impact on inflation. Customs duties will also affect market sentiment and drag down economic growth.” Despite these concerns, Williams maintained a generally optimistic view of the U.S. economy, citing the strong labor market and a gradual slowdown in inflation. “The US economy is in good shape and the labor market has stabilized. Inflation has gradually slowed,” he said. Williams also expressed confidence in current monetary policy, arguing that it is well positioned to adapt to changing economic conditions. “Monetary policy is in good shape and can be adjusted as needed. I don’t see any need to change interest rate policy at this time,” he concluded. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will There Be A Rate Cut This Year?

Backed by the positive shift in network activities, Cardano is now one of the most promising altcoins in the top 10 with bullish momentum as of writing. Amid the ongoing rebound, Cardano’s price has pared off some of its losses picked up from the volatility this week. Cardano Network Activity Sees Uptick According to data from Santiment , an ADA whale entered the market when its price briefly jumped to $1.13. The crypto analytics platform said this whale activity has been the most significant for three months. These whales represent transactions valued at $100,000 in ADA. Per the accompanying chart, as of March 4, the Cardano network has recorded 1,132 whale transaction counts. The Mean Dollar Invested Age came in at 529.05. In all, the network recorded 2,671 unique $100,000 transactions as the price jumped above $1.13 Alongside this uptick, Santiment noted that the sudden uptick in transactions worth $100,000 sparked a drop in the average age of Cardano now in wallets. This trend has an upside. It implies a jump in the number of ADA tokens in regular circulation. Cardano Price and the $10 Prospect At the time of writing, the ADA price was $0.9369, up 9.82% in the past 24 hours. The coin has traded in a very close range, from a low of $0.7684 to a high of $0.9502. Compared to an earlier ADA price analysis , in which the coin jumped 80%, the market remains cautious. However, the coin has the right fundamentals that might push it to a high of $10. Beyond the retained 35% growth over the past 7 days, Cardano’s open interest has skyrocketed by over 6% in 24 hours. Per Coinglass data, the coin’s futures open interest is 905.62 million ADA, worth over $842.04 million. A sustained boost in this metric might support the quest to breach higher price levels. ADA Price and ETF Catalyst The onchain enhancements spearheaded by Charles Hoskinson, like the push for Cardano to track government spending and the prospect of a Cardano ETF product, also boost ADA price sentiment. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Grayscale’s application for an ADA ETF. This acknowledgment places the coin on the list of altcoins awaiting official feedback from the SEC for approval or disapproval.

The lawsuit, filed in December, alleged Zelle’s parent company and the big banks often left victims of fraud on the instant payments platform to “fend for themselves.” Today, The CFPB told the court that it’s dismissing the action with prejudice, and without an explanation. The move follows the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken the agency by halting most of its operations, including investigations and rule-making. The administration’s stance reflects a broader goal of cutting federal bureaucracy, with Trump labeling the agency as a source of “waste, fraud, and abuse” that has harmed financial institutions. The CFPB’s lawsuit followed an investigation by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations led by Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who alleged Zelle and the banks routinely fail to adequately protect and reimburse consumers who use the popular network.

Per the South Korean newspaper Maeil Kyungjae , Seoul-based regulators are keeping a close eye on developments in Tokyo before making a decision on crypto spot exchange-traded funds. South Korean Bitcoin ETF Approval Drawing Closer? The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been discussing Bitcoin ETF approval since late last year . However, the body has repeatedly expressed a lukewarm attitude to crypto, and Bitcoin ETFs in particular. The headquarters of the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service. (Source: Financial Supervisory Service/YouTube/Screenshot) The newspaper wrote that Tokyo has also “previously taken a tepid stance on crypto,” but has recently “taken steps” to approve Bitcoin ETFs. As such, South Korean financial authorities have “also begun to respond.” The Financial Supervisory Service, another top South Korean regulator, has reviewed the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA)’s crypto policy and has “shared its findings with relevant organizations” in Seoul, the media outlet reported. Major Japanese media outlets like Nihon Keizai Shimbun (aka Nikkei) has reported that the FSA is considering reclassifying crypto as an investment tool. Nihon Keizai Shimbun added that the FSA is also “considering” granting Bitcoin and altcoin ETF approvals. Mayor of Seoul is hinting at a presidential bid with the slogan ""KOGA"" https://t.co/VvKC5ogprt — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) March 4, 2025 FSA Moving Fast? The South Korean regulators think that the FSA’s silence on this matter lends credibility to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun report. The FSA wants to roll out a raft of crypto-related regulatory changes before the end of June. The Japanese government plan will then likely approve these measures before new legislation rolls out in the second half of 2025 or early 2026. Maeil Kyingjae wrote: “If Japan speeds up the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in this manner, it will be interesting to see how the South Korean government responds.” Lawmakers in the South Korean National Assembly. The FSC, some feel, is acting with caution due to the ongoing power vacuum in Seoul. President Yoon Seok-yeol remains at the center of a drawn-out impeachment case . Japanese stocks have been stuck for about eight months, languishing below its new high hit last July and failing to convincingly break the curse of the ’80s. https://t.co/JkUPonFHhN — The Japan Times (@japantimes) March 3, 2025 Lawmakers Not Focusing on Crypto For Time Being In response, members of the National Assembly have stated that they have paused all work on crypto legislation until the “impeachment crisis” is resolved. This has effectively left the FSC and the Financial Supervisory Service to fend for themselves on crypto-related policy. The Democratic Party – the largest party in the National Assembly – last year pledged to allow citizens the right to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Prior to his election in 2022, Yoon also made a number of crypto-related manifesto pledges. However, his government failed to deliver on many of these.

While Seoul is usually more predisposed to follow Washington’s lead on financial policy, some South Korean regulators were concerned that the US decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 may have been overly bullish. This approach has angered many South Korean financial chiefs , who claim that the FSC is allowing rival nations to steal a march on Seoul. Maeil Kyungjae pointed out that the FSC has recently announced that it would “not approve virtual asset ETFs in the near future, citing Japan’s stance as the main reason.” Kim So-young, the FSC Vice Chairman and the head of the advisory Virtual Asset Committee , said last month: “I have continued to say that I would carefully review [Bitcoin spot ETF approval]. Several countries have not yet approved them. Examples include the United Kingdom and Japan.” The FSA, meanwhile, is also thought to be working on further crypto reforms. These include possible changes to the disclosure laws governing the financial information of crypto firms, and a law requiring all crypto investment advisors to sign up to a national registry.

Two of the funds will enable lending. Canada-based Blockstream announced plans for the funds in January. One fund will underwrite Bitcoin-backed loans. Another will use U.S. dollars as collateral for purchases of cryptocurrency. The third will function like a hedge fund, Bloomberg reported in March, citing unidentified sources. Blockstream’s makes its asset management debut Blockstream confirmed the Bloomberg story on X shortly after it appeared. The funds will go live on April 1, and the firm will begin adding external capital on July 1. Blockstream announced the formation of two of the funds in January. They mark the debut of Blockstream’s asset management division. The company said the funds were made possible by a $210 million investment round led by Fulgur Ventures in October that was intended to accelerate the company’s layer-2 development. Funding from Fulgrum boosted Swiss crypto bank Sygnum into unicorn status. The Blockstream Income Fund will loan U.S. dollars against Bitcoin collateral and focus on loans ranging from $100,000 to $5 million, a sector the company says is underserved, according to the company. Blockstream has a network of Bitcoin-native startups and other businesses are beginning to establish Bitcoin treasuries that will create a pipeline of borrowers. The fund targets yields in the high single digits to low teens. The Blockstream Alpha Fund will combine uncorrelated strategies to provide “consistent, risk-adjusted outperformance within the Bitcoin ecosystem.” The Bitcoin Yield Fund is described on the Blockstream website as “coming soon.” Its post on X implied that all three funds would launch at the same time. The funds are intended for institutions and qualified investors. Blockstream loans will fill a wintry gap The crypto winter of 2022 diminished the liquidity available in the system with the closure of lenders BlockFi, Genesis Global Capital, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius, as well as numerous smaller lenders. The collapse of FTX also shook the entire industry. Today, some centralized and decentralized exchanges offer loans. Credit can be obtained from other decentralized finance apps as well. Blockstream also made a $75 million strategic investment in digital asset services and custody provider Komainu in January. The investment aimed to integrate Blockstream’s Liquid Network asset management platform into Komainu’s off-exchange margining & settlement solution to cut transaction times from hours to minutes. It will also integrate Blockstream’s HSM wallet, among other things. Blockstream was co-founded by its current CEO Adam Back in 2014. Back is a specialist in cryptography and one of the cypherpunks who originated Bitcoin and much-related technology, especially related to privacy and censorship resistance . Back has been identified as Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. He denies that he is Nakamoto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Meet BlockDAG’s Pioneers Chasing $600M—Is It PEPE’s Turn to Break Out?,https://thecoinrise.com/aaves-bearish-outlook-escalates-meet-blockdags-pioneers-chasing-600m-is-it-pepes-turn-to-break-out/,"What is the top crypto to buy in 2025? As traders ponder this crucial question, three distinct cryptocurrencies emerge as top contenders for the upcoming months. AAVE’s bearish outlook is deteriorating further, with its price falling back to $250 and an increasing volume of transactions ending in losses. Meanwhile, after a significant drop last month, Pepe has found stability at a crucial support level, showcasing strong PEPE breakout potential if it holds. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a top crypto presale, bolsters its team with the addition of five new leaders. Combined with impending exchange listings and rapid growth, BlockDAG’s future looks increasingly bright. Analysts are even projecting an impressive 30,000x return for BDAG holders in the forthcoming years as the presale quickly heads towards its $600 million target. AAVE’s Bearish Outlook: Mounting Losses Signal Troubles Over the past year, Aave (AAVE) climbed from $94 to $400 before slipping to $250. However, the short-term view for AAVE bearish outlook grows increasingly gloomy, as many transactions are now ending at a loss. For every dollar of AAVE traded, $0.88 is lost. This trend highlights the growing fear and uncertainty in the market, particularly as major holders start to offload their holdings. This AAVE’s bearish outlook is further exacerbated by dwindling profits for long-term holders, adding to the selling pressure and potentially driving prices lower. Pepe Breakout Potential: Essential Resistance Marks The Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential is gaining traction after a significant downturn. Having plummeted 40% last month and an additional 4% recently, PEPE is now steadying at a crucial support level. If this support remains intact, experts suggest PEPE could rebound, with the breakout aiming towards $0.000016. The next major resistance is at $0.11, and breaking past that could propel PEPE to $0.21, with a further potential rise to $0.41 if the upward trend continues. Whether the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential materializes will also depend on wider market dynamics, particularly the movements of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlockDAG: Meet the Team Driving 30,000X ROI Potential! BlockDAG has recently welcomed five new experts to its leadership team, each seasoned in their respective fields. Nicolaas David van den Bergh, the new Chief Marketing Officer, boasts over 20 years in media and digital industries, aiming to enhance the network’s global outreach. Marcus Xavier, now Head of Learning, will leverage his instructional design expertise to enhance educational resources. Robert Radek, the new Product Manager, brings over seven years of experience in blockchain and fintech to spearhead innovation across BlockDAG’s offerings. Joshua Sack, a mining and cybersecurity specialist, will enhance the network’s security protocols, while Liza van den Berg will oversee HR and operations with her 13 years of experience in IT recruitment and business development. Together, these new leaders, along with the existing visionary team, aim to scale BlockDAG’s blockchain solutions, driving the network towards its $600 million crypto presale goal. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting a massive 30,000X ROI in the coming years as the network’s ecosystem expands, with its presale already crossed $200.5 million and upcoming exchange listings on the horizon. Currently, with BDAG priced at just $0.0248 in batch 27, it represents the top crypto to buy in 2025. Early participants have already enjoyed a 2380% return, and with a 30,000X ROI forecast in place, this offers the most substantial crypto opportunity today. Identifying the Top Crypto To Buy in 2025! As AAVE’s bearish outlook worsens with rising trade losses and diminishing long-term holder profits, indicating further price declines, the Pepe (PEPE) breakout potential remains robust, promising significant gains if current support levels endure. However, for those searching for the top crypto to buy in 2025 , look no further than BlockDAG. It stands out among other altcoins with its historic 30,000x ROI potential. Supported by a talented team and expertise across essential areas, the network is rapidly advancing towards a $600 million goal. Thus, the current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27 presents the best opportunity for maximum returns. However, with Batch 27 nearly sold out, swift action is essential to secure a spot before BlockDAG’s expected rise.

41166854,https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,1741132843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/41166854.jpeg,"Will Litecoin Hit the $500 Mark or Does Web3Bay’s 3,633% Growth Potential Offer More Value?",https://thecoinrise.com/will-litecoin-hit-the-500-mark-or-does-web3bays-3633-growth-potential-offer-more-value/,"Litecoin has recently broken out from its stagnant price range, achieving a noteworthy 30% rise within a fortnight. This surge has ignited discussions among analysts about whether LTC could reach the $500 milestone. Despite its well-established status in the crypto sphere, Litecoin’s path to significant gains is clouded by a competitive landscape that includes newer, more agile blockchains. Concurrently, Web3Bay is drawing considerable interest for its potential to redefine e-commerce through decentralization. Still in its presale phase, Web3Bay has already secured over $1.6 million in funding, with projections pointing to possible gains of up to 3,633% for early investors. This begs the question: is it more pragmatic to bet on Litecoin’s steady climb or to invest in the explosive potential of Web3Bay? Let’s delve deeper to uncover which offers the most promising prospects for 2025. Will Litecoin Achieve a $500 Valuation? The recent rally in Litecoin’s price has rejuvenated investor confidence, propelling LTC past the significant $100 resistance level to a current price of $128. If LTC can breach the $135 mark, it might set its sights on reaching higher resistance levels at $175 and $240, which correspond to key Fibonacci retracement levels, hinting at the possibility of further gains. Another pivotal factor for Litecoin’s potential growth is the prospective approval of a Litecoin ETF in the U.S. The SEC’s acknowledgment of a CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF filing and NASDAQ’s intent to list the ETF shares could usher in substantial institutional investment, driving up demand and prices. However, a surge to $500 would require an increase of nearly 290% from current levels—a feat Litecoin hasn’t managed since 2017. Given the rise of competitors like Solana and Avalanche, maintaining momentum to hit such a high target could prove challenging for Litecoin despite its optimistic short-term trajectory. Web3Bay’s Potential for a 3,633% Return While Litecoin offers a possibility for steady growth, Web3Bay’s promise of a high return on investment positions it as a potentially more lucrative endeavor. Web3Bay is innovating within the e-commerce sector by creating a decentralized platform where transactions bypass intermediaries, thereby reducing fees and enhancing user autonomy. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay aims to establish a more transparent, efficient, and community-focused shopping experience compared to traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay. The strong performance of the Web3Bay presale, which has already raised significant funds, underscores investor confidence. With the token priced at $0.005247 and a target launch price of $0.1959, early investors could achieve an ROI of 3,633% if the project reaches its expected valuation. Distinctive Factors Elevating Web3Bay’s Profile Tangible Benefits: Web3Bay is designed to solve genuine challenges in the e-commerce industry, suggesting a sustainable model for long-term growth. Advantageous Early Entry: The ongoing presale offers an opportunity for investors to acquire tokens at a minimal price before they are listed on major exchanges. Expansive Market Reach: The e-commerce industry, worth over $6 trillion, presents a vast field for Web3Bay to tap into with its decentralized solution, potentially removing costly fees and traditional barriers. Exceptional Growth Prospects: While Litecoin’s price might gradually increase, Web3Bay’s presale stage offers a unique chance for substantial returns in a shorter timeframe. Summing Up! Litecoin’s journey towards $500, though feasible, is fraught with uncertainties stemming from stiff market competition and the dependency on sustained institutional backing. In contrast, Web3Bay stands at a pioneering phase where the potential for extraordinary gains is markedly higher. As it carves a niche in decentralized e-commerce and continues to attract significant presale investments, Web3Bay represents an opportunity that is difficult to overlook. For investors who have previously missed out on early investments in major projects like Solana and Binance Coin, Web3Bay offers a comparable chance to participate at the ground level for potentially transformative returns.

XRP was created to be used with RippleNet, a blockchain-based network designed for banks and financial institutions. With growing adoption and potential replacement of traditional systems like SWIFT, many are asking: Can the XRP price hit $1,000? Can XRP Price Skyrocket if Trump Endorses It as Swift’s Successor? RippleNet provides customers with payments that are both speedier and cost-slower than what SWIFT, the industry norm, has delivered for many years. XRP serves as a bridge currency to enable swift currency exchange without dependent pre-funded accounts, which grants it superior functionality over conventional payment systems. SWIFT and XRP continue to compete actively, which reveals the move towards innovative payment systems. SWIFT operates as an established payment system for over 10,000 banks worldwide through a correspondent bank network, yet it has served the market since its inception many decades ago. RippleNet resolves settlement transactions through blockchain technology while offering almost instant and inexpensive transactions to compete against SWIFT’s control. Ripple has recently introduced XRP as a major international payment solution after the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve endorsed the blockchain network. XRP Price Analysis: Key Levels to Watch in March 2025 The latest price of XRP has seen notable fluctuations over recent days. As of March 4, 2025, the Ripple price is at $2.4, showing a surge of 1.83%. Most cryptocurrencies are struggling to recover after a day of massive liquidation. The top coin saw a strong rally earlier, reaching a peak of $2.83 before reversing its course, creating potential support and resistance levels that traders are currently eyeing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight bullish trend. The MACD line shows bullish momentum, having recently crossed above the signal line, signaling possible upward price movement. The RSI is positioned at 58.46, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, but its price could experience volatility as it hovers in neutral territory. Looking ahead, the support levels for XRP are seen at $2.20 and $2.00, while resistance is currently set around $2.46 and $2.50. A breakout above the $2.50 level could push the Ripple price prediction towards its next target of $2.80, representing a potential 19% price increase. On the downside, if XRP fails to hold its support, the next level to watch would be $2.00. XRP Price Chart: TradingView To sum up the, XRP price hitting $1,000 is a big stretch given the current market dynamics. While the technology behind XRP offers significant advantages, replacing SWIFT remains a challenge. The endorsement of prominent figures like Trump could boost its profile, but substantial hurdles remain for Ripple to reach such a high price point.

These holdings are worth around $7.18 billion. Some of these wallets had been idle for six to seven years before unexpectedly reactivating in January 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Below Parallel Channel – Is ETH Collapsing To $1,250? Old Wallets Begin Moving Large Amounts The once-idle wallets did not remain quiet for long, crypto sleuth ZachXBT disclosed. More than $109 million in XRP transactions were registered, with cash going to prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Bybit. This unexpected activity has prompted doubts regarding the timing and purpose of the transfers. Some in the cryptocurrency world worry if Larsen lost access to the wallets and only recently regained control. Others suspect that the money changed hands a long time ago, possibly as early as 2013. ZachXBT remarked that it is unclear whether Larsen still has direct control over all of these wallets. XRP: Market Impact And Price Surge The timing of these wallet activations coincided with a key announcement by US President Donald Trump. He outlined ideas for a strategic cryptocurrency reserve that comprises XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. This revelation caused a sharp price uptick in XRP: from $2.23 to a peak of $2.93 and then to $2.60, translating to an 18% increase. Investors and traders paid attention, with some conjecturing that the value increase was connected to the wallet movements. Previous Transfers Add More Questions Larsen’s transactions have made headlines before. Back in September 2020, he transferred approximately 500 million XRP, worth $115 million at the time, to an unidentified address. He later explained that the move was to NYDIG for security purposes. Nonetheless, others in the cryptocurrency field suspected that there could have been other motivations, although there was no substantial proof to corroborate those assertions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Risk Factor Remains High, Crypto Analyst Notes What Comes Next? Discussions have resurfaced in response to recent developments. Is this just ordinary fund management, or is there something bigger going on? The answers are still unknown. As the XRP community monitors these wallets, speculation persists. Will there be other significant transfers? Could this have a further impact on the XRP market price? While no one can say for sure, one thing is certain: when billions of XRP start moving, people will know and start to make some noise.

Forty-nine crypto wallets belonging to Parsarad were sanctioned as well. Nemesis itself was shut down last year. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions on Parsrad and his wallets on allegations that Nemesis sold almost $30 million in illicit drugs between 2021 and 2024. The site had 30,000 active users and 1,000 vendors. OFAC sanctioned 49 crypto addresses along with Parsarad Nemesis also provided such services as professional hacking services and the sale of false identification documents. Parsarad used the site to launder cryptocurrency for its users. Parsarad, an Iranian citizen living in Teheran, collected fees from users that OFAC estimated amounted to millions of dollars during its operation from 2021 to 2024. He was the sole administrator of the site. “Parsarad sought to build — and continues to try to re-establish — a safe haven to facilitate the production, sale, and shipment of illegal narcotics like fentanyl and other synthetic opioids,” Acting Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said. Chainalysis said the 44 Bitcoin wallets designated by OFAC on March 4 received more than $850,000 between July 2022 and March 2024 and sent more than $1.6 million from them, apparently taking advantage of the recent Bitcoin price surge. Parsarad also had five Monero wallets. Nemesis was shut down in March 2024 when U.S., German and Lithuanian law enforcement seized its servers. Parsarad kept a low profile in Iran, since drug offenses there carry punishments up to the death penalty. According to OFAC, Parsarad was discussing the revival of Nemesis’ services with vendors who had been active on it. Other darknet marketplaces have been sanctioned OFAC said in its announcement that this was the latest of several actions to combat drug trafficking on the darknet. It sanctioned Hydra Market in April 2022 and Genesis Market in April 2023. Authorities also targeted Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato, which laundered $700 million in crypto for Hydra users. Genesis also used a third-party payment processor. Bitzlato founder and majority owner Anatoly Legkodymov pleaded guilty in the United States to operating a money transmitting business in December 2023. The first darknet marketplace was Silk Road, established in 2011 by Ross Ulbricht and closed down in 2013. The U.S. government seized 174,000 BTC in that case and still holds them. Ulbricht received two life sentences in prison in that case, but U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned him this year.

President Donald Trump is set to headline the event. The summit, which will run from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM, will be a roundtable discussion featuring key figures like CEOs, investors, and members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets (PWG). According to Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, the guest list will be smaller than initially expected, with approximately 20-25 attendees. Among the confirmed participants are industry leaders such as MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is also expected to attend.

This meeting will serve as the first of a series of events designed to replace the previously proposed “crypto advisory council.” Although official invitations were just sent out recently, the event is already generating significant interest. For those not included in the roundtable, a larger, invite-only reception will be held across the street from the White House, allowing the wider crypto community to participate in the discussions. The gathering has sparked intrigue, especially given the involvement of prominent figures in both the government and the crypto industry.

Today, the spotlight turns to Web3Bay (3BAY) , a burgeoning project that promises to revolutionize blockchain-powered e-commerce, mirroring the early potential BNB once showed. For savvy investors aiming to capture significant gains from the next breakout token, Web3Bay emerges as a prime candidate for 2025. Already attracting over $1.6 million in its presale, this crypto gem is drawing in investors eager to participate before it catapults into mainstream recognition. BNB’s Rise to Stardom & Web3Bay’s Promising Path Initially, BNB was a modestly priced token designed for transaction fee reductions on the Binance platform. As Binance expanded and innovated, BNB’s value surged, peaking at over $600. Similarly, Web3Bay is carving its niche within the e-commerce sector. Rather than serving merely as a transactional token, 3BAY powers a decentralized marketplace facilitating direct interactions between buyers and sellers—free from intermediaries. Like BNB, which thrived by enhancing its utility across Binance’s growing ecosystem, 3BAY is poised to capitalize as Web3Bay’s platform attracts more users. For those who recognized BNB’s early potential and capitalized on it, Web3Bay offers a fresh opportunity to potentially replicate those successes in the burgeoning e-commerce blockchain space. Web3Bay’s Early Presale Success: A Prelude to Greater Achievements Web3Bay’s presale momentum is a testament to its burgeoning appeal, having swiftly exceeded $1.6 million in investments. This robust early support underscores the market’s recognition of its vast potential. Priced attractively at just $0.005247 during its presale, Web3Bay positions early investors for an exceptional potential return, forecasting a launch price of $0.1959—a prospective return of over 4200%. Adopting a structured 28-stage presale strategy, Web3Bay incentivizes early participation, similar to the successful launches of BNB, Solana, and Polygon. Web3Bay is not merely another digital token; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem poised to transform e-commerce. By eliminating traditional marketplace barriers like excessive fees and centralized data control, Web3Bay hands power back to the users, significantly reducing costs and enhancing transaction security. Why Web3Bay Stands Out Amidst a Sea of Cryptos In today’s saturated crypto market, Web3Bay distinguishes itself with its utility-driven approach within a legitimate business model. As the Web3Bay marketplace scales, the demand for 3BAY is expected to grow, fostering a self-perpetuating cycle of appreciation driven by actual utility and user adoption. While BNB took years to achieve widespread acclaim, Web3Bay is already making significant strides in its initial phase, promising rapid adoption and integration into the e-commerce industry. This not only positions it as a unique investment opportunity but also as a potential leader in the next wave of crypto innovations. Is Web3Bay Poised to Be the Next BNB? Reflecting on BNB’s ascension from a simple utility token to a multi-billion-dollar juggernaut, Web3Bay is charting a similar course in the lucrative e-commerce domain. As its presale approaches completion and early adopters secure their stakes, the window for entering at a ground-floor price is narrowing. Those who discern Web3Bay’s burgeoning potential now could witness substantial gains as it progresses into its next growth phase. The critical question remains: will you join as an early investor in what could be the next big crypto success, or will you sit back and watch another groundbreaking story unfold from the sidelines?

Turning to the layer-1 protocol Cardano, the trader unveils that deep-pocketed investors accumulated over $345 million worth of ADA over the same time period. “The largest whales on the Cardano ADA network have bought 420 million ADA in [24 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X All in all, crypto whales pocketed $2.51 billion worth of XRP and ADA in just a day. At time of writing, ADA is trading for $0.86. Turning to the charts, Martinez warns that XRP appears to be flashing a head-and-shoulders pattern, a bearish reversal structure that may indicate the uptrend is over once the asset moves below the pattern’s neckline. “XRP could invalidate this head-and-shoulders pattern with a daily close above $3, potentially paving the way for a rally to $5!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will plummet to $1.20 if it breaches the pattern’s neckline at $2. As for Cardano, the crypto strategist says he sees ADA igniting rallies if it takes out a key resistance area. “Cardano ADA could be poised for a rally to $2.20!

With countless options out there, finding a project with both excitement and potential is a rare gem. If you missed out on Binance Coin, now is the time to pivot towards Arctic Pablo Coin. A revolutionary meme coin with an adventurous story, Arctic Pablo Coin is rapidly gaining traction, and you don’t want to miss this thrilling ride to financial discovery.

Imagine an explorer named Arctic Pablo embarking on an adventure across icy terrains and uncharted ice-covered islands, uncovering hidden treasures along the way. This isn’t just about a coin—it’s about sharing the thrill of an expedition. Arctic Pablo Coin, or $APC, isn’t merely a digital asset but represents the promise of a magical journey into unknown territories, where every coin signifies both a treasure and an adventure. The presale for Arctic Pablo Coin is currently underway, and there’s a growing sense of urgency—prices are rising steadily, and the current phase could end at any moment. As Arctic Pablo continues his journey, the excitement is building, presenting investors with a unique opportunity to join before the next price increase. The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has already captured significant attention, raising over $1.74 million in its current phase, known as Chillville (Stage 13). The presale price is currently $0.00007 per coin, with the listing price expected to reach $0.008, offering investors a potential ROI of 11,285.71%. What makes this coin unique is its compelling narrative. Each presale phase is tied to different locations and stories, blending the worlds of myths and top crypto coins to create something entirely new. From Atlantis to Chillville, each stage unlocks a new chapter in Pablo’s journey, where the real magic unfolds.

As Pablo pushes further into unexplored realms, the presale prices will only rise, making this your final opportunity to get in at a low entry point. If you’re thinking about making an investment, this is it—the stakes are high, and the rewards even higher. Binance Coin: The Crypto Giant That Revolutionized DeFi Before diving deeper into Arctic Pablo Coin, let’s take a moment to reflect on the success of Binance Coin (BNB). Binance Coin has become a household name in the crypto world. Originally created as a utility token for the Binance exchange, BNB has evolved into much more than just a means of reducing trading fees on Binance. It is now a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem and a key player in the blockchain space. Binance Coin is powered by the Binance Smart Chain, just like Arctic Pablo Coin, but its focus is on scalability and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Binance Coin’s success story is a testament to the immense potential of the Binance Smart Chain, which has gained traction because of its lower fees and faster transaction times compared to Ethereum. As more developers and projects flock to the Binance Smart Chain, BNB continues to play a central role in powering the top crypto coins ecosystem. The performance of Binance Coin over the years has proven that getting in early can lead to significant rewards. However, as with all crypto, timing is everything. If you’re looking for an opportunity that could potentially offer even higher returns, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be your best bet. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as one of the top crypto coins with significant growth potential. The unique narrative-driven approach combined with a deflationary token burn mechanism and enticing staking rewards makes Arctic Pablo Coin an exciting opportunity for investors looking for the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Don’t let this chance slip away—join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and be part of an adventure that could lead to great financial rewards! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin, and what makes it unique? Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin with an adventurous narrative, centered around an explorer named Pablo who uncovers hidden treasures. What makes it unique is its presale structure, which is divided into different locations as Pablo’s journey progresses. This keeps the story fresh and exciting for investors. How is Arctic Pablo Coin different from Binance Coin? While both Arctic Pablo Coin and Binance Coin use the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin with a unique presale structure, staking rewards, and a narrative-driven approach, unlike Binance Coin, which primarily focuses on DeFi and reducing transaction fees within the Binance ecosystem. Why should I invest in Arctic Pablo Coin now? If you missed out on Binance Coin’s early success, now is your chance to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin. The current presale phase offers a low entry point, and prices are set to rise as the presale progresses. Additionally, the coin’s deflationary burn mechanism ensures increasing scarcity, which could enhance its value over time. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s staking program work? Arctic Pablo Coin offers an attractive 66% APY staking program. By staking your $APC tokens, you’ll earn rewards as the coin grows. The more you stake, the higher your earnings will be, and all staked coins will be vested for a two-month period from the launch date. What is the token burn mechanism, and how does it affect Arctic Pablo Coin? Arctic Pablo Coin uses a token burn mechanism where unsold coins are permanently removed from circulation during the presale. This deflationary strategy helps increase the coin’s scarcity, which could drive its value higher as the supply decreases. The post Didn’t Get in on Binance Coin?

One day, you’re riding a rocket to the moon; the next, you’re left staring at a chart that looks like a ski slope. Case in point: Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), a meme coin that made a splash when it launched on December 17, 2024, at $0.06 per token. The hype was real, but today? PENGU is trading at just $0.0066—a crushing 89% drop from its debut. Ouch. Now, imagine being one of the early buyers who held on too long, watching their six-cent dream melt like an ice cube in July. That’s the reality of meme coins: timing is everything. And if you’re looking for the next big thing, you might want to shift your focus to a fresh contender— BTFD Coin , which is possibly one of the best new meme coins to join this week. The Pudgy Penguins Price Rollercoaster: A Reality Check Pudgy Penguins wasn’t just another meme coin; it rode the NFT hype train straight into the crypto market. At its all-time high of $0.0692 on launch day, early buyers thought they’d struck gold. But the excitement fizzled fast, especially for those who hesitated to buy the dip before the coin reached its ATH. The token’s market cap sits around $418 million today, with a circulating supply of roughly 62.86 billion tokens. The takeaway? Dips can be awesome opportunities to cash in big, but only if you spot the signs of a meteoric rise early. Luckily, you might still catch BTFD Coin before it surges to insane heights! Why BTFD Coin Is Making Noise (and Raising Millions) BTFD Coin is part of a bigger movement, backed by a growing community and a killer Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. Currently, in its 14th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.00016, attracting over 11,200 investors and raking in $6.25 million so far. More than 71 billion BTFD tokens have already been sold, and the numbers keep climbing. But here’s the real kicker: BTFD Coin has an actual ecosystem. With a high-reward staking system and a fully integrated gaming experience, it offers real reasons to hold beyond the memes. What Makes BTFD Coin Stand Out? P2E Gaming Revolution – BTFD Coin’s game isn’t just another pixelated cash grab; it’s designed to be engaging, rewarding, and fully integrated into the token’s ecosystem. Community-Powered Growth – The Bulls Squad, BTFD’s core community, is made up of diamond-hand believers who see the long-term vision. Massive Staking Rewards – With an average APY of 90%, early adopters can compound their holdings while waiting for price appreciation. Deflationary Tokenomics – Strategic burns and a limited supply mean that as demand increases, scarcity kicks in, potentially boosting long-term value. The Numbers: What If You Buy BTFD Coin Now? If you invest $3,000 in BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll secure 18,750,000 tokens. If BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006 upon listing, your holdings would be worth $11,250—a 275% gain. But if it climbs to $0.006 (which isn’t far-fetched given the buzz), you’d be looking at $112,500. That’s a potential 3,650% return on investment. With Stage 14 of the presale wrapping up soon, the price is set to increase in the next phase. Translation? If you wait too long, you’ll be paying more for the same bag. The Verdict: Will You Catch the Next Wave or Watch From the Sidelines? Crypto history is littered with stories of people who hesitated and missed out. Pudgy Penguins had its moment, and while some early investors made money, many were left holding the bag. BTFD Coin, on the other hand, is still in its infancy—with massive upside potential. The window to get in early on one of the best new meme coins to join this week is closing.

Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week? BTFD Coin is gaining momentum due to its high-energy community, successful presale ($6.25M+ raised), and its P2E game that rewards players with BTFD tokens. Analysts predict a potential surge to $0.006, offering a 3650% ROI for early investors. How did Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU coin rise in value after its ICO? Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU started as a niche meme coin but skyrocketed in value due to strong community backing, NFT success, and its rapid expansion into Web3 projects. It saw a multi-fold increase post-ICO, making early investors significant profits. How much could a $3,000 investment in BTFD Coin be worth if it reaches its predicted highs? At the current presale price of $0.00016, $3,000 would buy 18.75 million BTFD tokens. If BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 at launch, that investment would be worth $11,250. If it moons to $0.006, it could skyrocket to $112,500!

PI Network Posts Profits as CoinMarketCap Listing Nullifies Bearish Headwinds Pi Network, a mobile-minable cryptocurrency, has long faced challenges due to anti-money laundering (AML) concerns and regulatory roadblocks. Trading was largely confined to P2P and OTC markets, limiting its mainstream adoption. However, shifting U.S. regulatory policies under the Trump administration have sparked renewed interest in Pi Network, paving the way for listings on top exchanges like Bitget. PI Network (PI) Listed on CoinMarketCap | March 4 Pi Coin secured a crucial listing on CoinMarketCap on Tuesday, marking a significant milestone for the project. This development has amplified demand and enhanced visibility, attracting new investors to the network. At press time, Pi Coin trades above $1.74 with a $12.1 billion market cap, posting a 3% gain. Notably, PI is the only cryptocurrency among the top 20 to remain in profit amid market-wide liquidations triggered by Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Increased Trader Activity, Nullifies Impact of Market Liquidations Ahead of March 17 Migration Deadline PI Network is currently undergoing a crucial migration process. Last week, the team confirmed in a blog post that March 17 is the final deadline for users to migrate their holdings. Those who fail to comply risk losing access to a significant portion of their PI assets. Crypto Market Liquidations Cross $1 billion on March 4, 2025 | Coinglass With less than two weeks remaining, network activity has surged. Previously inactive traders are now migrating their coins, driving heightened transaction volumes. Supporting this trend, PI’s hourly chart shows consistently elevated trading volumes, even as the broader crypto market experienced over $1 billion derivatives positions liquidated following Trump’s tariff confirmation on Monday, according to Coinglass data. As PI Network navigates this critical transition period, market participants remain watchful of its next major move, particularly with speculation surrounding a Binance listing. PI Coin Price Forecast: Bulls Eye $10 as Market Momentum Shifts PI Coin price is consolidating near $1.78, with early signs of a potential breakout as volatility contracts. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, signaling an impending move, while price action hovers near the mid-band at $1.74. A decisive push above the upper Bollinger Band resistance at $1.90 could fuel a strong rally toward the psychological $2 level, with extended targets aligning with a bullish breakout scenario toward $10 in the long term. The Parabolic SAR indicator has flattened, suggesting a shift in trend dynamics. A confirmed breakout above $1.90 with rising volume could validate bullish momentum, targeting previous swing highs. Meanwhile, the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator shows a battle between buyers and sellers. The green zone signals emerging bullish strength, but the broader downtrend remains unbroken unless bulls maintain support above $1.74. PI Coin Price Forecast On the bearish side, failure to reclaim $1.90 could trigger renewed selling pressure, with downside risks toward $1.58 and $1.54. A drop below these levels would expose PI Coin to further weakness, potentially revisiting lower liquidity zones. However, as long as price stabilizes above key supports and buying pressure builds, bulls may reclaim control and set their sights on higher targets, with $10 remaining a long-term bullish objective.

During the previous week Shibas Inu lost more than 10% of its value as its February market crash exceeded 30%. The cryptocurrency faces imminent danger as two vital support zones exist at $0.000012 and $0.0000094. The experts predict that breaking below $0.000012 in value will send SHIB plummeting 23% to $0.0000094. The current struggles of SHIB cause investors to shift their focus toward projects that merge innovative concepts with practical utility which leads them to inquire about alternative options like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Shiba Inu’s Market Position The recent performance of Shiba Inu directly follows changing conditions across the crypto market. During early February SHIB reached its all-time high of $0.00001964 before dropping to $0.0000123 thus eliminating months of market growth. The Relative Strength Index stands at 45.68 which suggests that the market currently falls outside the ranges of both overbought and oversold. The indicator analysis of Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) maintains a position beneath its signal line which suggests that bearish forces are active in the market. SHIB faces recovery barriers at $0.00001405 because Bitcoin maintains a low correlation of 0.79 with other cryptocurrencies which leaves SHIB without support from market trends. The prospects of achieving a 1000% price increase become elusive because of a lack of catalysts to boost market demand. SHIB’s re-entry into the top-10 market cap requires strong resistance to technical impediments while generating renewed market enthusiasm which seems unlikely due to present risk awareness patterns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gains Momentum During Shiba Inu’s market instability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) charges ahead with its second presale stage which gathers $2 million from new holders that exceed 3,800 users. MUTM is launching its price increase from $0.015 to $0.02 in the following stage while maintaining a current cost of $0.015 which gives all investors a 33% boost. Structured tokenomics outline a $0.06 listing price, locking in a 300% return for current participants. Beyond presale gains, projections suggest MUTM could reach $3.50 post-launch—a 233x surge from today’s price. Presale Demand Intensifies The presale performance of Mutuum Finance derives from its dual-lending mechanism together with built-in purchase motive applications. Users receive interest-bearing mtTokens (for instance mtETH) by depositing their assets including ETH or DAI through Mutuum Finance. These tokens gain value during the time period. Through these tokens the platform supports decentralized borrowing function while suppliers can earn dynamic yields from liquidity pools. The built-in peer-to-peer lending mechanism expands utility by allowing users to trade non-standard assets which include meme coins. The income generated from loan activities allows MUTM to conduct continuous buybacks which distribute the tokens back to staking participants. The continuous demand creation together with anti-abuse features becomes a self-strengthening system. The strategy augments its goal of creating urgency because the presale slots decrease simultaneously with the implementation of a $100,000 giveaway for initial participants. Mutuum Finance gives priority to systemic financial stability instead of hyperactivity which characterizes meme coins. The lending mechanism in Mutuum Finance operates under a loan requirements design that incorporates excess collateral as a safety measure for lenders. Variable interest rates modify according to market assessments to create balance between risks and gains. Security concerns related to newer projects are resolved by conducting third-party audits on smart contracts used by Mutuum Finance. Long-term planning reaches its peak through token allocation methods. Scarcely thirty-five percent (35%) receives diverted funds from supply to offer trading post-launch liquidity benefits. MUTM operates under protection from sudden market fluctuations since funds for partnerships and development and reserves occupy distinct sections of its supply. Shiba Inu faces technical challenges alongside declining momentum in its journey toward achieving higher price appreciation of 1000%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates DeFi technology with strategic project growth to establish itself as an excellent investment option. Early investors who purchase in presale periods achieve immediate profits as well as joining long-term successful ventures featuring robust demand. The upcoming price hike will decrease the available opportunity time. Mutuum Finance’s presale phase 2 offers one of the lowest prices before exchange listings. At $0.015, the token bridges accessibility with exponential potential. Join 3,800 holders and position for gains up to 300% at launch—or beyond.

Solana Realized Profit Registered A Sharp Spike Yesterday According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Realized Profit observed a huge spike for Solana recently. The “Realized Profit” here refers to an indicator that, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total amount of profit that the investors are ‘realizing’ through their selling. The metric works by going through the transfer history of each coin being sold on the blockchain to see what price it was transacted at prior to this. If this previous selling price for any coin was more than the current spot price, then that particular token’s sale is leading to profit realization. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Range The Next Key Resistance, Analytics Firm Says The Realized Profit takes the difference between the two prices to calculate the exact amount of profit involved in the transaction and sums it up for sales across the network. In the context of the current topic, the usual Realized Profit isn’t the metric of interest, but rather a derivative form known as the Realized Profit by Age. This indicator basically tells us about how the SOL profit-taking is distributed among the various coin age bands. An “age band” is a time-range within which coins part of the band were last moved. The 1-week to 1-month age band, for instance, refers to the part of the supply that was last involved in a transfer between one week and one month ago. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Solana Realized Profit by Age over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the aggregated Solana Realized Profit observed a huge spike on Monday following the recovery in the cryptocurrency’s price toward the $180 mark. The sharp rally in the coin came after United States President Donald Trump announced a Crypto Strategic Reserve that is going to include five digital assets, one of which is SOL. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As Bitcoin & Altcoins Bounce Back It would appear the investors were keen to cash in on this opportunity, as the SOL Realized Profit shot up to an hourly value of over $257 million, making the profit-taking event one of the largest in the last couple of months. Interestingly, as the chart displays, 99% of the aggregated profit realization (around $255 million) came from the 1-day to 1-week age band alone. This would suggest that the profit-taking spree was almost entirely due to investors who bought during last week’s dip, capitalizing on their quick gains. SOL Price Solana has crashed following the profit-taking selloff as its price has returned back to $136.

Despite a recent drop from $98,000 to $96,000, many experts maintain that BTC is on course for its next upward move. Last month’s record high of $109,114.88 has fueled speculation that the next milestone will be $116,652, with long-term projections ranging between $150,000 and $200,000. While Bitcoin remains the leading force in the crypto market, those seeking higher returns are turning their attention to budget-friendly altcoins that offer substantial growth potential. Two stand out as top contenders before Bitcoin’s anticipated rally: Web3Bay (3BAY) and Sonic (SONIC). Both remain priced under $1, making them accessible options for investors aiming to optimize their portfolios before the next major market upswing. Bitcoin’s Projected Move: Will It Break Past Six Figures? The recent decline to $96,000 may have unsettled some traders, yet market analysts see this as a routine correction before Bitcoin continues its upward trend. With a previous all-time high of $109,114.88 confirming its bullish outlook, the focus now shifts to whether BTC can surpass $113,000 to $116,000. This expectation is driven by historical market behavior, increased institutional involvement, and the rising demand for Bitcoin ETFs. On-chain data suggests significant whale accumulation, reinforcing the belief that another upward movement is approaching. Some experts anticipate Bitcoin reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 in the coming months, cementing its status as the dominant digital asset. Despite Bitcoin’s potential, its high price limits the ability of smaller investors to capitalize on its growth. As a result, the strongest opportunities lie in lower-market-cap altcoins with significant room for appreciation—making Web3Bay and Sonic particularly compelling options. Web3Bay (3BAY): Positioned for a 3,633% Surge Web3Bay is rapidly gaining traction in the crypto sector due to its decentralized approach to e-commerce. Unlike centralized platforms such as Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay operates on blockchain technology, eliminating intermediaries, reducing transaction fees, and granting users greater control over their purchases. This model has driven high demand for its native token, 3BAY, which has already surpassed $1.5 million in presale funding. Investors are drawn to its real-world application within the $6 trillion global e-commerce market, offering an alternative to centralized platforms known for high fees and restrictive policies. Currently, 3BAY is priced at $0.005247, yet its anticipated launch valuation of $0.1959 suggests a potential return of 3,633% for early participants. The presale follows a structured 28-stage system, where each stage raises the token price, meaning that early investors have the most significant opportunity to benefit before 3BAY enters mainstream trading. Web3Bay stands apart due to its combination of practical use and high growth potential. Many altcoins struggle to retain value due to a lack of adoption, but Web3Bay directly addresses a major inefficiency in online commerce, positioning it as a strong candidate for sustained success. Sonic (SONIC): A Low-Cap Altcoin Gaining Market Momentum Sonic is another budget-friendly altcoin drawing increased interest. Built with an emphasis on speed, efficiency, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Sonic offers an alternative to conventional financial systems while delivering rapid transaction speeds. SONIC’s recent 12% price increase has captured investor attention, signaling growing momentum. With a relatively low market capitalization and early-stage adoption, it has ample room for further price appreciation, making it an appealing choice for investors aiming to capitalize on an upcoming altcoin rally. What sets Sonic apart is its extensive utility within the DeFi ecosystem. Its integration into various blockchain projects—including cross-border transactions, yield farming, and decentralized applications—indicates rising demand for SONIC tokens. This increasing adoption is expected to drive further price growth in the months ahead. Why Web3Bay & Sonic Are Worth Considering Before Bitcoin’s Next Move While Bitcoin is likely to achieve new price milestones, altcoins with high growth potential remain the most viable options for maximizing returns. Web3Bay and Sonic offer strong investment potential at low entry points, making them attractive ahead of Bitcoin’s next move toward six figures. Web3Bay’s projected 3,633% return, supported by its expanding presale and blockchain-based e-commerce model, highlights its position as one of the most promising projects of 2025. Meanwhile, Sonic’s role in the growing DeFi market and its increasing adoption provide additional expansion opportunities. By securing positions in these altcoins before Bitcoin’s next rally, investors can position their portfolios for significant gains. With Bitcoin expected to break past $116,000 and potentially reach new highs, now presents an opportunity to consider altcoins poised for substantial price movement.

The summit, led by AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, replaces the now-terminated “crypto council” that Former President Donald Trump once promised. Formal invites started going out Tuesday, with confirmed attendees such as Strategy’s Michael Saylor, Multicoin Capital’s Kyle Samani, and Paradigm’s Matt Huang. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev even teased that he would be there, along with Coinbase and Kraken, who said their CEOs, Brian Armstrong and Arjun Sethi, would attend. The White House summit is expected to serve as a key forum for shaping future crypto regulations. Exclusive Summit limits attendance as White House shifts crypto strategy According to reports , the White House Crypto Summit will have a smaller-than-expected guest list featuring government officials from the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. A larger reception is planned nearby for those not invited to the roundtable. Amid increasing infighting within the industry and overwhelming demand for seats, the Trump administration pivoted to a more permanent crypto council. Instead, the White House will convene crypto summits periodically to meet with leaders. With critical regulatory decisions on the horizon, the event is seen as a sign of things to come for the administration’s approach to digital assets. Saylor pushes Bitcoin strategy as institutions and states boost investments Michael Saylor recently called for the U.S. to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, describing it as the “greatest economic program of the 21st century.” Saylor also said that the U.S.’s ownership of 10–20% of the Bitcoin network could be used to lower the national debt. Despite concerns about the sustainability of the Bitcoin acquisition plan, large financial institutions continue to invest in the company through buying shares or fixed-income securities. According to a Feb. 6 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.6 trillion in management assets, increased its Strategy stake to 5%. BlackRock’s filing came one day after MicroStrategy rebranded to Strategy and adopted a Bitcoin-themed marketing scheme to reflect its core focus. A dozen US states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin, currently hold Strategy stock as part of their pension programs or treasury funds. California’s State Teachers’ Retirement Fund had the largest exposure among the 12 state funds, holding nearly $83 million in Strategy stock. The California Public Employees Retirement System was close behind, which manages state employee pensions and holds approximately $76.7 million in Strategy shares. On Feb. 20, Strategy announced a $2 billion convertible note offering, its latest corporate securities move to fund additional Bitcoin purchases.

Qubetics, Cardano, and Ethereum are in the spotlight, each offering unique value. Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain interoperability, Cardano has staged a remarkable rally, and Ethereum is facing a crucial support test after a steep decline. With crypto presales gaining traction and altcoin season approaching, which projects holds the strongest potential for long-term gains? Qubetics: Solving Blockchain’s Biggest Problem—Interoperability Most blockchain networks today operate in isolation, making cross-chain transactions and seamless data exchange difficult. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralized applications (dApps), financial services, and enterprise blockchain adoption. Qubetics aims to eliminate these barriers by building a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple blockchain ecosystems. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and interoperability, Qubetics aims to become a critical bridge for developers, enterprises, and users navigating the decentralized world. The Qubetics presale is seeing rapid investor demand, surpassing $14.5 million as $TICS trades at $0.0976 in Stage 24. With 495 million tokens already distributed to 22,100+ investors, the project is moving toward its final presale stages. Analysts anticipate $TICS hitting $0.25 before exchange listings, offering a 155.93% ROI for early investors. Those investing $100 at today’s price would receive 1,023.72 tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 post-mainnet launch, that investment would yield an ROI of 10,136.92%, positioning Qubetics as one of the top crypto presales with long-term profit potential. Ethereum: Will ETH Hold the $2,400 Support Level? Ethereum has sharply declined, falling 12.22% over the past week to $2,438.47. Despite its $294.04 billion market cap, the second-largest cryptocurrency has broken key support levels, signaling potential downside risks. With trading volume surging 160.73% to $37.49 billion, sellers have taken control of the market. Ethereum’s downtrend began on February 24, and the price is now hovering just above a crucial $2,400 support zone. If Ethereum fails to hold this level, analysts warn that it could drop to $2,200, creating uncertainty for investors. However, if ETH rebounds from support, it could offer a strong recovery play for those eyeing long-term growth. Cardano: Defying the Market with a Massive 39.93% Rally Cardano (ADA) has outperformed the broader market, surging 39.93% in the past seven days to $1.06. This impressive rally has reignited investor interest, pushing Cardano’s market cap to $37.43 billion and solidifying its position in the top 10 cryptos. ADA’s trading volume exploded by 1,396.90% to $8.79 billion, with technical indicators confirming a strong breakout on March 1. Cardano successfully broke multiple resistance levels, demonstrating bullish momentum with minimal retracement. However, some analysts caution that momentum indicators show overbought conditions, meaning a short-term cooldown could occur before another push higher. If ADA sustains its breakout trend, it could continue rallying toward higher price targets, making it one of the best crypto investments for 2025. Which is the Best crypto investment? Qubetics, Ethereum, and Cardano each present strong investment opportunities, but their appeal depends on an investor’s risk appetite and time horizon. Qubetics stands out as the most explosive opportunity for those seeking high-growth potential, with its crypto presale nearing completion and a possible 10x–15x price surge post-mainnet launch. It is a key player in blockchain interoperability, solving a major industry problem that could drive mass adoption. Cardano’s bullish price action has solidified it as a top-performing altcoin, proving that investor confidence remains strong. Despite its recent pullback, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency, with institutional backing and massive network utility. With 2025 shaping up to be a pivotal year for crypto, these three projects are proving that the biggest opportunities often emerge in times of transformation. Whether investors seek massive gains in Qubetics, stability in Ethereum, or momentum-driven growth in Cardano, each of these cryptos offers a compelling case for being among the best crypto investments of the year. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs How does Qubetics improve blockchain interoperability? Qubetics acts as a Web3-aggregated chain, allowing seamless cross-chain transactions, asset transfers, and data sharing. This eliminates barriers between blockchain networks, making it easier for developers and users to interact across ecosystems. Will Ethereum recover after its recent drop? Ethereum is currently testing the $2,400 support level. If buyers step in, ETH could stage a recovery. However, if sellers maintain control, ETH could decline further to $2,200 before finding stability. Can Cardano’s rally continue? Cardano has broken multiple resistance levels, and if trading volume remains strong, ADA could extend its gains. However, momentum indicators show overbought conditions, meaning a short-term pullback before further upside is possible.

As reported by Business Insider, the motion presented by Senator Ted Cruz, was approved under the Congressional Review Act on Mar. 4, indicating that both parties were against the Biden-era rule. Introduced in December, the IRS DeFi broker rule required DeFi platforms to report user data for tax compliance, thereby broadening the definition of “brokers” to include them. Since decentralized platforms do not hold funds or keep customer data in the same manner as traditional financial institutions, critics claimed the law was impractical. The digital asset think tank Coin Center referred to the proposal as “technologically unfeasible.” “The Biden administration did everything it could to stifle financial innovation in the United States,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said in a statement. “The Senate is working to undo these burdensome regulations one at a time to restore financial freedom for the American people.” The resolution must still pass the House of Representatives in order to be delivered to President Donald Trump for final approval, even after the Senate has approved it. In addition to being prohibited from enforcing the rule, the IRS would also be prohibited from enacting similar policies in the future if the rule were to become law. You might also like: SEC’s crypto task force to hold roundtables on crypto regulations and security status Supporting the repeal, the Blockchain Association, which represents popular cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap Labs, said it will avoid needless limitations on DeFi innovation. According to the DeFi Education Fund, the Senate vote was the “first of many historic milestones in the regulation of digital assets in the United States.” This vote echoes previous attempts to remove Securities and Exchange Commission accounting standards for digital assets and continues a trend of bipartisan crypto-related legislation. The Senate’s ruling might lay the stage for more extensive regulatory reforms, since stablecoin and cryptocurrency market structure legislation is anticipated to be on the legislative agenda. A matching resolution has already been approved by the House Financial Services Committee, and a final floor vote is still pending. According to the White House, President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law as soon as possible.

Vital BTC trading indicators suggest BTC could struggle to hold the recent gains. Bitcoin (BTC) Retakes $87,000 as Market Sell-Off Subsides Bitcoin rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a turbulent 48-hour sell-off triggered by market fears as Trump announced commencement of 25% tariffs on US imports from Canada and Mexico. Investors had withdrawn capital from risk assets following the former president’s announcement on Monday, leading BTC to slump to $82,000, its lowest level in over two weeks. However, as broader market sentiment stabilized, Bitcoin swiftly reclaimed lost ground, surging 9% in the last eight hours to trade at $87,300 at press time. Bitcoin Price Action | BTCUSD 4-hourly Chart, March 5. The BTC/USD 4-hour chart reveals a strong relief rally, with price action bouncing off key support at $82,000 and reclaiming the critical $87,000 resistance level. The rapid move suggests aggressive short covering, as traders who had bet against Bitcoin were forced to unwind positions. However, spot market volumes remain moderate, indicating that fresh bullish momentum has yet to fully materialize. Despite the recovery, BTC price remains vulnerable to renewed selling pressure if macroeconomic fears persist. Failure to hold above $87,000 could see BTC retest support at $83,500, while a decisive breakout above $88,500 would position the market for a potential retest of the psychological $90,000 barrier. The next few sessions will be crucial in determining whether this rebound holds or fades into further volatility. Bitcoin Long positions holders booked 74% of total market liquidations While Bitcoin’s price rebounded 9% to reclaim the $87,000 level, liquidation data suggests that bullish momentum remains fragile. According to Coinglass , Bitcoin long position holders absorbed $370 million in liquidations over the last 24 hours, accounting for 74% of the total $505 million liquidated across the crypto derivatives market. This disproportionate loss among bullish traders signals that the rally may lack strong conviction, increasing the risk of a pullback. Crypto Market Liquidations, March 5 | Source: Coinglass Typically, when long liquidations dominate the market, it indicates that bullish traders were overly leveraged, leading to forced sell-offs that pressure prices lower. The BTCUSD 4-hour chart further supports this, showing a relief rally following a deep sell-off, but with no confirmation of strong buy-side continuation. This suggests that the recent price surge may be driven more by short-covering rather than fresh capital inflows. If Bitcoin fails to consolidate above $87,000, bearish pressure could send prices back toward $83,500 in the coming sessions, with $82,000 as the next major support. However, if bulls can regain control and push BTC above $88,500, the next critical resistance lies at $90,000, a level that could determine Bitcoin’s mid-term trajectory. BTC Price Forecast: Analyst Cole Garner identifies Bitcoin Order Book Depth Pattern Signaling Next Big Move Analyst Cole Garner identified another key Bitcoin price forecast signal alluding to long-term recovery timeline. As seen in the chart he posted on X on Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price action exhibits a strong correlation between deep bid-side liquidity and explosive rallies, as highlighted in previous accumulation phases. The lower panel, tracking order book depth cumulative sum delta, shows a fresh surge in green bid-side liquidity, historically signaling smart money accumulation before breakouts. BTC Price Forecast This pattern has preceded major bullish runs, and if history repeats, Bitcoin could be on the verge of another expansion phase. A sustained bid above $85,000 could trigger a breakout toward $92,000, with an extended rally toward the psychological $100,000 mark if liquidity absorption remains consistent. However, despite the bullish setup, the chart also reveals a historical cyclical reversion. Each liquidity spike was followed by a sharp contraction, marked by red sell-side dominance, triggering corrective retracements. If Bitcoin fails to hold support at $81,500, order book imbalances could shift bearish, opening the door for a pullback to $76,800. A deeper rejection below this level could expose liquidity gaps down to $72,500, risking further capitulation. With Bitcoin hovering at a crucial inflection point, the market’s next move will be dictated by whether bid-side liquidity converts into price expansion or dries up, triggering a reversal. Traders are watching order book dynamics closely, as smart money positioning suggests a major move is imminent. The post Bitcoin Price to $100k or $70K?

Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing bullish momentum, fueled by whale accumulation, but its success still depends on market hype. Avalanche (AVAX) is struggling near key support, with uncertainty looming over its next move. Then there’s Web3Bay (3BAY), a project revolutionizing e-commerce with blockchain—and it’s already proving its worth. Unlike DOGE and AVAX, 3BAY isn’t just another tradable asset—it’s a real solution to online commerce barriers. With a presale raising over $1.6M, 390 million+ tokens sold, and a projected 6,430% ROI at launch, Web3Bay is attracting early investors looking for substantial gains and long-term adoption. Avalanche (AVAX) Struggles at $25 – Will Bulls Defend Key Support? Avalanche (AVAX) is facing renewed selling pressure, slipping 3% to $25 after failing to hold its recent $27 resistance. The token previously rebounded from a five-month low but is now at risk of further declines. If $24 support fails, AVAX could drop to $21.2 or even $17.3, mirroring its August 2024 lows. Despite the current bearish trend, a strong bounce from support could trigger a reversal, with resistance at $27.2, $31.5, and $38 as key targets. However, low trading volume suggests market indecision, and a surge in volume could determine the next major move. Investors are watching closely—a breakout could mean big gains, but another dip could offer a strategic buying opportunity. If bulls regain control, AVAX could be gearing up for a strong recovery in the coming weeks. Dogecoin (DOGE) Gearing Up for a Major Breakout? Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a potential breakout, with large holders aggressively accumulating despite recent market fluctuations. Transaction volume has surged 40%, indicating rising investor interest. Analysts believe this accumulation phase could trigger a strong upward move in the coming weeks. Whales holding 10M–100M DOGE have amassed over $6 billion since November, signaling growing confidence in DOGE’s long-term potential. Currently, DOGE is holding strong support at $0.23, with key resistance at $0.35. A breakout above this level could attract both retail and institutional buyers, pushing prices toward previous highs of $0.48. With a growing holder base and rising community engagement, Dogecoin is positioning itself for a potential rally. As crypto sentiment improves, investors looking for high-upside opportunities may find DOGE an attractive bet before momentum fully kicks in. Web3Bay: Transforming E-Commerce with Blockchain Innovation Most online marketplaces are controlled by centralized entities that make decisions without user input. Web3Bay is changing that by giving power to its community. The 3BAY token lets holders vote on platform updates, ensuring a decentralized governance system. Web3Bay is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about crypto presales of 2025, offering a groundbreaking decentralized e-commerce platform that aims to disrupt traditional online marketplaces. By eliminating intermediaries, Web3Bay allows users to buy and sell goods with full control over their transactions, avoiding the high fees and restrictions imposed by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay. Its multi-chain payment system supports various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and even PayPal integration, bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 commerce. With over $1.6 million raised and more than 390 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s presale is gaining momentum at an unprecedented rate. Currently priced at $0.00524 in Stage 5, the token is expected to hit $0.1959 at launch, presenting a massive 3,639% potential ROI for early investors. Whales have already poured over $200,000 into Web3Bay within 24 hours, signaling growing institutional confidence in the project. Security is another key advantage, with Web3Bay leveraging IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for tamper-proof data storage, ensuring transactions remain decentralized and censorship-resistant. As e-commerce giants face increasing criticism for high fees and centralized control, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the future of online shopping, making it one of the top crypto investments of 2025. Final Outlook While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to attract attention, their success largely depends on market sentiment and short-term price movements. DOGE’s whale accumulation signals potential for a breakout, but its long-term value remains speculative. AVAX faces resistance at $27, with a risk of further decline if support fails. These assets offer trading opportunities, but neither presents the fundamental transformation that Web3Bay (3BAY) brings to the market. Web3Bay is not just another token—it’s a real-world solution to global e-commerce challenges. By removing high fees, banking restrictions, and centralized control, 3BAY creates a seamless, decentralized marketplace. Its hybrid payment system, NFT expansion, and decentralized governance model set it apart from typical crypto projects.

This follows a day of intense negotiations with both nations, suggesting a potential compromise in U.S. trade policy. The move could scale back some of the recently imposed 25% tariffs. Right away, the largest tech stock ETF rose nearly 1% in late trading, and index futures bounced back from their lows. These remarks came right after the U.S. stock market faced sharp declines for the second day, driven by fears that Trump’s tough trade policies could spark a full-blown trade war. Specifics Not Revealed! The Cabinet secretary didn’t reveal the specifics of Trump’s plans but hinted that the president would be open to meeting Canada and Mexico “in the middle.” He also suggested that Trump would not completely remove the tariffs. “Both the Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they’ll do better,” Lutnick said Tuesday afternoon. Lutnick hinted that any deal would need Canada and Mexico to address on issues Trump has criticised. He noted, “The President is fair and reasonable,” but added that Mexico and Canada must “do more” before any relief happens. The comments came just hours before Trump was scheduled to give a primetime speech to Congress. Trump Threatens For EU Tariffs Trump has always defended tariffs as a negotiation tool, claiming that Canada and Mexico haven’t done enough to stop drugs and crime from entering the U.S. Now, with the economic impact being felt, the administration seems ready to adjust its approach, but not entirely. Tariffs on China began in February, and China retaliated. Trump then raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%, and China will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. farm goods starting Monday. Trump also threatened new tariffs on the EU, possibly extending the trade war to Europe. Impact On The Crypto Market The tariff announcement yesterday had caused havoc in the crypto markets as well with Bitcoin dropping over 9% to $83K levels, while Ethereum plunged 15% and altcoin saw a steep decline as well. Bitcoin is now trading at $87,723, up over 4% in the past 24 hours. Altcoin like Ethererum, XRP, SOL and Cardano have also experienced slight increase as they are up over 5%, 9%, 5%, and 22% respectively over the past day. The crypto market cap is close to $4 trillion today, with an increase of 4% in the past day. Crypto-related stocks also have seen gains: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is up 9.55%, Coinbase (COIN) is up 3.22%, and Marathon Digital (MARA) has gained 1.34%.

The first major resistance is near the $2,275 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,550 swing high to the $2,003 low. A clear move above the $2,275 resistance might send the price toward the $2,350 resistance. An upside break above the $2,350 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions.

THE NEXT 1000X CRYPTO – CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW! OFFICIALMAGACOIN: A New Entrant with Explosive Potential Launched recently, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has made a remarkable entrance by raising over $3.8 million within minutes during its presale phase. This rapid capital influx underscores strong investor confidence and suggests a robust demand for the token. The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability. While it holds promise, these issues may impact its ability to sustain the momentum required for a 1000x surge.

In his latest post on X, the analyst references historical price behavior, a potential channel formation, and precise technical indicators to suggest that XRP may be on the verge of a swift move toward the $27-$33 price range. The timeframe for this potential surge, according to his analysis, could be as short as 28 days if conditions mirror XRP’s 2017 bull run. XRP Price To Hit $33? Egrag opens his post by acknowledging the risk and difficulty of making time-based forecasts. “Sometimes, I throw myself under the bus with time predictions, but honestly, it’s worth sharing with the community! Even though I know it might backfire, I still give it a shot,” he writes. He also reiterates his broader philosophy: “Now, let me be clear—I never try to time the market because it’s nearly impossible. Instead, I follow the golden rule: ‘Time in the market is more important than timing the market!’” This balance between caution and optimism underscores the delicate nature of technical analyses in unpredictable cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: XRP Price Can Fall Further To $1.5 If This Level Fails To Hold The centerpiece of Egrag’s analysis is a potential weekly channel that he believes strongly resembles the price structure XRP exhibited in 2017. He points out that, during that period, the cycle leading from the channel’s inception to the final breakout lasted approximately 175 days. Within that timespan, the token recorded a rise of about 2,500% from the lower boundary of the channel. That surge culminated in a cycle “blow-off top,” a term used by traders to describe a rapid price climb followed by an even quicker reversal. According to Egrag, these chart features appear to be resurfacing now, with XRP showing signs of maintaining support above the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). “We’re seeing similar XRP price action today, with the 21 EMA closing above and only a minor wick,” he notes, suggesting that the token’s price is finding strength near a well-watched moving average. Such support, if sustained, can be an early indicator that bullish momentum is building. One of the most eye-catching points in Egrag’s chart is his projection that XRP could climb toward the Fib 1.618 extension level, where he places a tentative target between $27 and $33. He explains that, if 2017’s channel pattern truly echoes today’s structure, XRP may replicate a similar percentage gain and time duration before hitting that upper range. “If we apply this same pattern to the current market, XRP could surge to the Fib 1.618 level, targeting $27-$33!” he writes. He further suggests that this parabolic move “could happen within just 28 days,” based on his historical observations. Before reaching this high, XRP could first target the Fib 1.272 level at $8.38, followed by the Fib 1.414 level at $13.67. These are historically relevant Fibonacci extension points that traders often monitor as price advances in an uptrend. Related Reading: XRP Price Bubble Burst? This Pattern Suggests Imminent Drop To $1.1 In the immediate short term, XRP is currently positioned at the 0.888 Fibonacci retracement level ($2.23), with additional support at the 0.786 level ($1.57) and 0.702 level ($1.78). These levels suggest that XRP is consolidating within a structured Fibonacci-based pattern before an anticipated breakout. This 28-day forecast is arguably the most striking part of his analysis, reflecting a break from his usual reluctance to pin down short-term timelines. Egrag concedes that timing market moves is notoriously challenging but remains confident that reviewing past cycles can still offer valuable insights. “Even though I know it might backfire, I still give it a shot,” he remarks, acknowledging the inherent volatility and unpredictability of crypto assets. At press time, XRP traded at $2.32.

Sigel outlined three major proposals — SIMD 096, SIMD 0123, and SIMD 0228 — in a post on X on Mar. 4. These proposals seek to improve Solana’s ( SOL ) economic framework but have the potential to reduce validator revenue by up to 95%. Solana has several upcoming protocol upgrades, known as SIMDs, aimed at enhancing its technical capabilities and economic framework. These changes could help stabilize and strengthen Solana's position in the crypto ecosystem moving forward. Solana recently implemented SIMD 096… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) March 4, 2025 Solana’s SIMD 096, implemented on Feb. 12, redirected 100% of priority fees to validators, eliminating the previous system that burned half of these fees. Staking payouts increased as a result, but off-chain trading agreements between validators and traders were deterred. SimD 0123, which is currently up for vote, would further divert revenue away from node operators by requiring validators to pay priority fees to stakers. SIMD 0228, the most contentious proposal scheduled for a vote on Mar. 6, would modify Solana’s inflation rate based on stake participation. The network’s yearly inflation rate would decrease from 4.7% to 0.93% if staking levels stayed at 63%. This would lower token dilution but also reduce staking rewards, much to the disadvantage of validators. You might also like: Hamster Network hits 34,028 TPS, surpassing Solana and Aptos Validators are mainly concermed about the high operating costs required to run nodes. These include mandatory voting fees of 1.1 SOL each day (about $58,000 yearly) and hardware expenditures of approximately $6,000 annually. Since only 458 of Solana’s 1,323 validators own a sufficient amount of stake to turn a profit , smaller operators risk being forced out. Lowering voting fees has been proposed by several community members as a way to alleviate financial strain. Despite the controversy, Sigel maintained that reducing inflation would benefit SOL in the long run by lowering sell pressure and supporting the token’s value. Solana’s network activity remains strong. With $109 billion in February, the blockchain has surpassed Ethereum for the fifth consecutive month, demonstrating its dominance in decentralized exchange volume, according to DeFiLlama data . The current plans, however, might render operating a node unfeasible for small validators, which could result in even more centralization. Read more: What is Physical Bitcoin?

It is now eyeing to break the $2 mark. Pi Network has seen a major drop from its all-time high of $3, now trading around the range of $1.60-$1.70. Despite the broader market downturn, investor sentiment remains hopeful, with signs that a reversal could be on the horizon. The MACD indicator shows potential bullish momentum, but with the RSI still below 50, recovery may be slow until market conditions improve Adding to the bullish theory, the X account ‘Binance Intern’ tweeted some intriguing messages. The first tweet read, “If you’re reading this, you’re a real one,” followed by the Pi symbol. This is the first time Binance has directly referenced Pi Coin in this way. Could it be a joke? Maybe. But it sure looks like they’re giving Pi some attention. In another tweet, they asked, “If your favorite project was a dessert, what would it be?” and posted a slice of pie emoji. These tweets have been getting massive attention and this could be a way for Binance to gauge the Pi community’s interest. What’s next for Pi Coin? The big news is that Pi Day (March 14th) is approaching, and experts believe that’s when Pi Coin could be listed on Binance. If Binance lists Pi, it will put pressure on other exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Crypto.com, and Gemini to list it too. Pi’s trading volume is huge right now and other exchanges will want a piece of that action. Pi Coin’s community is one of the strongest out there. People have been mining Pi since 2019, and many are holding onto their coins for the long term, even locking them up until 2027.

The asset’s latest price action shows signs of upward momentum, with analysts debating whether this breakout is sustainable. Meanwhile, on-chain data reveal a SOL whale transferred 494,153 SOL, valued at $71.95 million, to Coinbase Institutional, adding further speculation about market movements. Solana Price Attempts Breakout From Descending Channel In recent Solana price analysis, technical indicators suggest the asset is challenging key resistance after weeks of downward movement. A descending parallel channel has been restricting its price, but the latest attempt to break above this trendline has drawn attention from traders. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart showing Solana price moving past its downtrend resistance, targeting a potential rally toward $213. If confirmed, this move could indicate a shift from a bearish trend to a more sustained uptrend. However, analyst Seth maintains a cautious outlook, suggesting that Solana price remains within the broader channel, facing resistance at crucial levels. Source: X Whale Transfers 494,153 SOL to Coinbase Institutional Additionally, blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported a SOL whale moving 494,153 SOL, worth approximately $71.95 million, to Coinbase Institutional. Large-scale transfers of this magnitude often attract market attention, as they may indicate either selling pressure or institutional accumulation. If the transferred SOL is intended for liquidation, it could introduce selling pressure, potentially affecting the ongoing breakout attempt. However, if the transaction is related to over-the-counter (OTC) trading or institutional accumulation, it may signal increased demand, which could support further upward movement. According to recent Solana whale activities, SOL price might be headed for a breakout to $180. A whale’s $14 million accumulation eased selling pressure, supporting the recent rebound to $145. If momentum sustains, breaking the $170 resistance could pave the way for a SOL rally toward $180. Buyers Return as SAR and MACD Suggest a Breakout Meanwhile, Solana price technical indicators have also turned bullish, supporting the potential breakout. The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator, represented by the dotted blue lines, has shifted below the price candles, signaling a possible trend reversal to the upside. This suggests that selling pressure is weakening and buyers are regaining control, increasing the likelihood of a sustained price recovery. Source: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Histogram further reinforce this bullish sentiment. The MACD line has started converging toward the signal line, reducing the bearish momentum. Additionally, the histogram bars have begun turning green, indicating a potential crossover into positive territory. This shift suggests that buying pressure is building up, which could support an upward move toward $170 and possibly $180 if resistance levels are breached. However, historical resistance between $175 and $185 remains a significant test for the asset. To confirm a true breakout, Solana price needs to maintain high-volume closes above these levels. Failure to do so may result in a rejection, pushing the asset back into the descending channel. More so, the Solana network has outpaced Ethereum in terms of active users and transaction efficiency. This has lead to speculations that SOL price could hit $500 before ETH price reaches $5,000. With 73.4 million monthly active addresses compared to Ethereum’s 7.4 million, Solana’s adoption rate suggests strong upside potential. If this growth trend continues, analysts believe SOL could outperform ETH in the near term.

The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $2.40 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Ripple Lawsuit Continues: The crypto community is now eagerly awaiting the outcome of the ongoing Ripple case. Despite the SEC’s recent dismissal of cases against several cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap and Gemini among others, the lawsuit against Ripple Labs remains unresolved. Additionally, President Donald Trump’s recent announcement designating XRP, Ripple’s native token, as part of the U.S. government’s strategic cryptocurrency reserve has raised expectations for a favorable resolution. Ripple’s legal team has asked for a deadline of April 16, 2025, to submit their cross-appeal. This date is important because it could affect how the case moves forward. Experts believe the case could be resolved before this date, but no official updates have been given yet.

Scott Bessent Hints at Rate Cuts,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-interest-rates-go-down-today-scott-bessent-hints-at-rate-cuts/,"The post Did Interest Rates Go Down Today? Scott Bessent Hints at Rate Cuts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent brushed off concerns about a Wall Street selloff following the White House’s trade war with Canada, China, and Mexico. Speaking on Fox & Friends , Bessent emphasized that President Trump’s main focus is improving the living standards of everyday Americans, despite market worries over the 20-25% tariffs on key trading partners. Rebalancing The Economy Bessent stated that, although Wall Street has been successful, the primary focus is on supporting small businesses and consumers. He highlighted that the goal is to rebalance the economy to benefit everyday Americans in the long run. Bessent’s comments came shortly after the tariffs took effect, causing the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to drop nearly 2% in the morning, now 10% lower than its peak on December 16. “One of the biggest wins for the American people, since election day and since inauguration, mortgage rates have come down dramatically,” he said. “The bottom 50% of Americans over the past two years have gotten crushed by these high interest rates.” Mortage Rates See Massive Drop Bessent said that mortgage rates have dropped significantly since Election Day and the inauguration. He believes this decline is partly due to expected bank deregulation, which could have a positive impact on the economy and mortgage rates. 30-year mortgage rates dropped to 6.76% on Thursday, the lowest in two months, down from 6.85% last week. They had peaked at a 10-year high of 7.79% on October 26, 2023, during Biden administration. Bessent Dismises Inflation Concerns Over Tariffs Some economists worry that the tariffs could drive inflation up and keep interest rates high through 2026. Bessent dismissed concerns that tariffs would increase inflation, pointing to Honda moving production from Mexico to Indiana to avoid them. He’s confident that manufacturers will absorb the tariffs, keeping prices steady, and believes the U.S. is in a middle of “transition” with Canada and Mexico. Bessent explained that lower interest rates would not only help homeowners but also reduce the costs of credit cards and auto loans, which have hurt low-income Americans. “Bringing interest rates down is one of our greatest achievements so far,” he said. He noted that while inflation is easing, it is still not back to the Fed’s target. However, Bessent remarked that affordability has been hit hard over the past few years, when asked about the impact of affordability on inflation. Since Trump took office, investors now expect the Fed to cut rates three times by the end of 2025, lowering the federal funds rate from 4.25%-4.5% to 3.5%-3.75%. This is a shift from just one expected rate cut when Trump first took office.",News|Crypto news|Fed,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 04:40:47

With meme coins surging in popularity, the search for the next big winner is on. While Floki Inu and Non-Playable Coin have been making headlines, all eyes are now on Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), a rising star in the meme coin space. Floki Inu recently announced a major marketing push, while Non-Playable Coin has been expanding its metaverse integration. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is the real game-changer, with an innovative token burn mechanism and a presale structure unlike anything seen before. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin , Non-Playable Coin, and Floki Inu. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: How Token Burns Drive Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) introduces a powerful deflationary model through its token burn mechanism. By permanently removing unsold tokens from circulation every week during the presale, APC ensures increasing scarcity, which can drive value upward. Not only that, but any tokens left unsold after the presale will also be burned, further reducing supply and fostering a deflationary environment. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), all burn transactions are recorded transparently, adding an extra layer of trust. This strategy is designed to enhance investor confidence and create a long-term growth trajectory for the token. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale: Enter ChillVille Before Prices Rise! Arctic Pablo Coin has now reached ChillVille, the 13th stage of its unique meme coin presale journey, where APC is available at just $0.000070. With an ROI potential of over 11,285.71% from this stage to its launch price of $0.008, the opportunity to secure massive gains is closing fast. Over $1.74 million has already been raised, proving the overwhelming demand for this project. Unlike traditional presales, Arctic Pablo Coin’s sale isn’t divided into rounds but by locations as it “travels,” adding an exciting narrative to its journey. As each new location is reached, prices increase, making ChillVille one of the last stops before a major price jump. Those who get in now at the lowest entry point stand to benefit the most. With its next location on the horizon, the chance to buy at $0.000070 is fading quickly. Non-Playable Coin: Expanding the Metaverse Frontier Non-Playable Coin is making waves with its latest push into the metaverse, introducing new partnerships that enhance its virtual ecosystem. This strategic move positions it as a key player in the NFT gaming space, attracting a broader audience. With metaverse adoption growing rapidly, Non-Playable Coin’s innovations could set the stage for long-term success. As Arctic Pablo Coin gains traction, Non-Playable Coin’s latest developments add to the excitement in the meme coin space. Floki Inu: Marketing Blitz Boosts Community Growth Floki Inu has ramped up its global marketing campaigns, securing high-profile sponsorships and expanding its reach. With a strong community and increasing adoption, this strategic expansion could drive further price appreciation. As the meme coin market heats up, Floki Inu’s aggressive branding efforts keep it at the forefront of investor interest alongside Arctic Pablo Coin and Non-Playable Coin. Analysts Predict $0.10 for APC—A Million-Dollar Opportunity? Crypto analysts are bullish on Arctic Pablo Coin, forecasting a massive price surge to $0.10 post-listing. With its listing price set at $0.008, early investors at the current $0.000070 price point could see life-changing returns. A $1,000 investment today would secure 14,285,714 APC tokens, translating to $114,285 at listing and an astonishing $1,428,571 when the price hits $0.10. The potential for such gains has made Arctic Pablo Coin one of the Top Meme Coin Presales to Buy Now . As the project continues its journey through new locations, the window for early investment is closing fast. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge Meme coins continue to capture investor attention, with Non-Playable Coin diving deeper into the metaverse and Floki Inu leveraging aggressive marketing strategies. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique presale structure and deflationary model set it apart. With its token burn mechanism, strategic price hikes, and massive ROI potential, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as a top pick among meme coin investors. As ChillVille nears its end, those looking to enter at the lowest price point must act fast before APC’s next price jump.

ADA has gained a whopping 16% in the last 24 hours. Ripple’s XRP has also bounced back in the last 24 hours and is up by more than 6%. The price is now trading at $2.44, eyeing to break levels above $2.50. Bearish Divergence on the 3-Day Chart According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , XRP has been showing signs of a bearish divergence on the 3-day time frame. This means that while the price has been making higher highs, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been making lower highs. This divergence has been present for some time, and despite short-term bounces, it suggests that we might not see a strong bullish trend anytime soon. Until XRP sees a confirmation of an invalidation signal, the bearish trend could still continue. Short-Term Price Action: Support and Resistance Levels The price is currently bouncing from a significant support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. If XRP breaks below this level, it could drop to the next major support zone around $2. Currently, there’s a lack of strong momentum in either direction, so we may see sideways movement in the short term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Lawsuit News: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Says ‘Trump Has To Drop’ The Case , The RSI has recently reset to neutral levels, which could lead to more stable, less volatile price action. In the past, when the RSI reset from overbought conditions, XRP experienced relatively flat price movement for a few days. Resistance Levels to Watch If XRP continues its short-term bounce, key resistance levels to watch are between $2.65 and $2.80. Additional resistance could be found around $3.00, with a possible short-term resistance at $2.50 based on previous support turning into resistance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On February 26, Story (IP) surged beyond $7, following a massive 115% rally. However, within hours, the token dropped by 15%, indicating the volatility of the market despite initial bullish sentiment. The A.I. market, including Story (IP)holders, now eyes Coldware (COLD) as the next potential standout, with growing interest in its decentralized gaming platform and blockchain-based infrastructure. Coldware (COLD), already making waves in the GameFi sector, offers a refreshing twist for Story (IP) holders who are witnessing this retracement. As Story (IP) prices fluctuate, Coldware’s focus on blockchain technology that powers game economies provides Story (IP) holders an interesting investment alternative, promising both short-term rewards and long-term growth. Story (IP)’s Price Retracement and Coldware’s Potential After Story (IP) hit its peak, the retracement became a talking point for investors watching Coldware (COLD). With Story (IP) facing pressure, Coldware is seen as an ideal move for those looking to diversify their holdings in the blockchain gaming space. Coldware (COLD) offers a solid investment case, especially as it integrates seamlessly into GameFi ecosystems, a sector that has proven to be a high-growth area within the cryptocurrency world. As Story (IP) faces challenges in regaining its upward momentum, Coldware (COLD) continues to attract a strong following among traders. Despite Story (IP)’s bullish run, the new Coldware (COLD) layer offers multiple use cases within the gaming industry, and its continued development is expected to boost its value in the coming months. Coldware’s (COLD) position within blockchain gaming represents an exciting entry point for investors, including Story (IP)holders who may be seeking a new and innovative way to capitalize on the booming sector. With Story (IP) retracing after its rally, Coldware’s rise within GameFi continues to hold significant potential. Could Coldware (COLD) Surpass Story (IP)? As Story (IP) faces retracement, it is important to consider the broader picture of the A.I. market, where Coldware (COLD) could potentially take the lead. If Coldware (COLD) continues to develop its offerings in blockchain gaming, it could surpass Story (IP) in terms of adoption and usage. Coldware is quickly becoming a dominant player in GameFi, and as the market shows signs of retracement for Story (IP), Coldware (COLD)’s value proposition in decentralized gaming continues to resonate with A.I. investors.

This decline has led to a wave of liquidations totaling $1 billion over the past 24 hours, as leveraged traders faced significant losses amid the market correction. According to Coinglass, a total of 305,170 traders were liquidated during this period, reflecting the impact of Bitcoin’s latest decline in price on investor positions. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Range The Next Key Resistance, Analytics Firm Says Detailing The Total Liquidations The majority of liquidations came from long positions, where traders had bet on Bitcoin’s price increasing. As the market moved against them, forced sell-offs occurred, accelerating the downward momentum. Data from Coinglass shows that long liquidations accounted for over 80% of the total, reaching $833.24 million, while short liquidations were significantly lower at $170.08 million. Among the affected crypto exchanges, Bybit and Binance recorded the highest liquidation volumes, with $411.54 million and $242.25 million, respectively. Bitcoin itself accounted for the largest share of the total liquidations, contributing $371.66 million. Ethereum (ETH) was the second most impacted cryptocurrency, with $200.94 million in liquidations, while other crypto assets collectively accounted for over $100 million. The single largest liquidation order took place on Bitfinex, with a $13.40 million BTC position being forcefully closed. The high liquidation volume suggests that many traders were caught off guard by Bitcoin’s price drop. With long positions dominating liquidations, it indicates that market sentiment was largely bullish before the downturn. Market Outlook: Can Bitcoin Recover Soon? Despite the sharp downturn, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Crypto analyst Javon Marks noted that despite the recent decline, indicators still suggest Bitcoin could be gearing up for a larger bullish rally. Signs are still pointing towards a monumental bullish rally for Bitcoin.$BTC — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) March 4, 2025 Meanwhile, RektCapital pointed out that Bitcoin’s decline has resulted in a fully filled CME gap between $84,650 and $93,300, which could potentially lead to a price reversal in the near term.

Qubetics Presale—A Limited-Time Window for Early Buyers If you’re looking for the best crypto presale to join right now, Qubetics is the one to watch. The project is currently in Stage 24, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0976. Over 495 million tokens have been sold, raising a staggering $14.5 million and bringing in over 22,100 token holders. But here’s the kicker—presale prices increase every 7 days, with a 10% price jump every Sunday at midnight. And the potential gains? Mind-blowing. $TICS at $0.25 (presale end) = 155.93% ROI $TICS at $1 (post-presale) = 923.72% ROI $TICS at $5 (long-term) = 5,018.58% ROI $TICS at $10 (mainnet launch) = 10,137.16% ROI $TICS at $15 (mainnet success) = 15,255.75% ROI For example, a $1,000 investment today at $0.0976 per token would give you 10,246 tokens. If $TICS hits $10 post-mainnet launch, that’s a $102,460 return. With the mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, early buyers are locking in their spots before prices explode. 2. Filecoin (FIL) — Decentralizing Data Storage for the Web3 Era The internet is built on data storage, and today, tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft control the industry. But Filecoin is changing the game, offering a decentralized storage network (DSN) where anyone can rent out extra storage space, creating a Web3-powered alternative to centralized cloud providers. Why does this matter? Because businesses, developers, and individuals need secure, censorship-resistant, and cost-effective storage solutions. With the rise of AI, NFTs, and DeFi, demand for decentralized storage is surging—and Filecoin is at the forefront. Currently, FIL trades at a fraction of its all-time high, making it an attractive long-term play. As Web3 adoption accelerates, Filecoin’s network effect and demand for decentralized data storage could send FIL skyrocketing. 3. Cosmos (ATOM) — The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is solving one of crypto’s biggest challenges: blockchain fragmentation. Right now, most blockchains operate in isolation, unable to interact with each other efficiently. Cosmos fixes this with its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, creating an internet of blockchains where assets and data flow seamlessly. Think of it as the highway system for blockchain networks—instead of each blockchain being a standalone island, Cosmos builds bridges between them, making transactions and smart contract execution much faster and more efficient. With the rapid expansion of DeFi, gaming, and enterprise adoption, Cosmos’ role as an interoperability powerhouse could push ATOM into massive growth territory in the coming years. 4. Polygon (MATIC) — Ethereum’s Scaling Powerhouse Ethereum is the most-used blockchain in the world, but it’s notorious for high fees and slow transaction speeds. Polygon is solving this by building Layer 2 solutions that make Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more scalable. With top-tier partnerships (including Starbucks, Nike, and Disney) and increasing adoption in DeFi and gaming, Polygon is cementing itself as Ethereum’s go-to scaling solution. As the Ethereum ecosystem expands, Polygon’s demand will only continue to rise, making it one of the best cryptos with 1000X potential to invest in right now . Conclusion: The Crypto Projects Set to Explode The days of betting on meme coins and hype-driven projects are over—real utility is what drives long-term growth. Qubetics is leading the charge by fixing blockchain interoperability and revolutionizing cross-border payments. Filecoin, Cosmos, and Polygon each bring massive real-world use cases to the table, making them top contenders for explosive gains in 2025. For those looking for serious upside potential, Qubetics’ crypto presale is currently the hottest opportunity. With its mainnet launching in Q2 2025 and potential for 10,000%+ ROI, early buyers are locking in before the next price jump. Don’t miss out on one of the best crypto presales in 2025!

DOGE tested $0.1820 and is now consolidating below the $0.2150 resistance. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.2150 and $0.2100 levels. The price is trading below the $0.2100 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1900 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a recovery if it clears the $0.2050 and $0.2120 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Recovery Dogecoin price started a fresh decline below the $0.2150 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.2050 and $0.200 support levels. It even spiked below $0.1880. A low was formed at $0.1826 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the $0.1950 level. The bulls pushed the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2421 swing high to the $0.1826 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1900 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2050 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2120 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2421 swing high to the $0.1826 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.2195 level. A close above the $0.2195 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2220 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2350 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2050 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1950 level. The next major support is near the $0.1920 level. The main support sits at $0.1820. If there is a downside break below the $0.1820 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1740 level or even $0.1650 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

With BTFD Coin’s presale surging past $6.25 million, Moo Deng seeing a notable trading volume increase, and Turbo facing a market shift, meme coin enthusiasts are watching closely. Right now, BTFD Coin is making waves in the staking world, offering a massive 90% APY and a limited-time referral bonus that has investors stacking up tokens before the final presale stages. Meanwhile, Moo Deng’s rising market activity is catching attention, and Turbo is experiencing a cooldown after recent volatility. The real question is—which of these three projects offers the best potential for significant returns? BTFD Coin’s Presale Momentum and Analysts’ Predictions FOMO is kicking in as BTFD Coin’s presale continues to gain traction, drawing in over 11,200 bulls and selling more than 71 billion tokens at $0.00016 per coin. With only two presale stages left, investors are jumping in before prices rise again. But what’s really driving this surge? BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a staking powerhouse. Investors who lock in now secure a 90% APY, making it one of the best cryptos to stake for passive income. On top of that, BTFD’s referral program is adding fuel to the fire, giving users a 10% bonus on all referred purchases and extra rewards for top referrers. But here’s where it gets even more exciting—BTFD Coin’s $0.006 moon target. Analysts predict that once it lists, it could see massive price surges, and early investors are eyeing a potential 3650% ROI. A $15,000 investment at $0.00016 right now would secure 93,750,000 BTFD tokens. At $0.0006 listing price, that turns into $56,250, and if it hits the projected moon price of $0.006, that same investment would explode to $562,500. Getting in on BTFD’s presale is easy. Investors simply need to: Set up a wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Connect to the BTFD presale page and select the purchase amount. Enter the 100% BONUS CODE “LAUNCH100” and double their tokens instantly. Confirm the transaction and secure their BTFD tokens. With the presale stages closing fast, this is one of the last chances to own the dip before prices shoot up. Moo Deng Gains Interest as Trading Volume Climbs Moo Deng is not your average meme coin. Inspired by a viral pygmy hippo, this Solana-based project is building traction in the meme coin market. Despite an 18.77% price drop in the last 24 hours, its trading volume has risen by 22.59%, signaling renewed interest. With its unique branding and growing niche appeal, Moo Deng has the potential to ride the next meme coin wave. Investors are watching for signs of a market reversal, as increased trading volume often precedes price movement. While Moo Deng’s current trend is uncertain, it remains one of the more talked-about meme coins on Solana. Its ability to capture attention through viral branding has positioned it as a potential breakout player in the meme coin space. Turbo Faces Market Shifts After Recent Drops Turbo made history as the first-ever AI-generated meme coin, created through GPT-4’s direction. But after seeing explosive early success, it’s now experiencing a market cooldown, with its price dropping 15.34% in the last 24 hours and trading volume down by 16.75%. Despite these dips, Turbo’s community remains strong, and its unique AI-driven narrative keeps it relevant in the evolving crypto landscape. Many investors see Turbo’s pullback as a potential buying opportunity, while others wait for the next major push in market sentiment. The real challenge for Turbo will be regaining momentum in a competitive meme coin sector. With projects like BTFD Coin offering staking rewards and referral incentives, investors seeking immediate gains may find better opportunities elsewhere. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is emerging as the top contender among meme coins right now. With its 90% APY staking, referral rewards, and explosive presale growth, it’s easily one of the best cryptos to stake for significant gains. Meanwhile, Moo Deng is gaining traction with increased trading volume, indicating stronger market interest, while Turbo navigates its latest price fluctuations. Both projects have potential, but BTFD Coin’s combination of staking, presale momentum, and analyst predictions is setting it apart as the best pick. With BTFD’s presale nearing its final stages, this is the last chance to get in before the price jumps. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and own the dip before it’s too late. FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the best cryptos to stake? BTFD Coin offers a 90% APY staking program, a high-paying referral system, and strong presale momentum, making it a top choice for passive income seekers. Is Moo Deng’s volume increase a sign of a market recovery? Moo Deng’s 22.59% trading volume increase suggests growing interest, but its price action remains uncertain. Many investors are watching for further movement before making a decision. Can Turbo regain its momentum after its price dip? Turbo’s AI-driven meme coin status keeps it in the conversation, but its recent price decline and lower trading volume suggest a period of consolidation before its next potential move.

This company created the cryptocurrencies Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST). Kwon's career is notable. He co-founded Terraform Labs in January 2018 with Daniel Shin. Their goal is to enhance payment systems using blockchain technology. This effort led to the creation of the Terra blockchain and its tokens, LUNA and UST.Details:Organization: Terra MoneyLocation: South KoreaEducation: BS in Computer Science from Stanford University Experience:Founder & CEO at Terraform Labs logo from Jan 2018 - Present Founder & CEO at Anyfi Inc. from Jan 2016 - Oct 2017 FAQ's1.

What is the net worth of Do Kwon?Do Kwon's net worth is $10 Billion Entrepreneur Crypto and Blockchain Expert Chief Executive Officer fate is set in stone! Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon’s U.S. court hearing has been postponed after prosecutors uncovered a massive trail of new evidence. Originally set for March 6, the hearing will now occur on April 10, giving both sides more time to review the findings. For those asking, I can confirm Do Kwon's status conference has been pushed back from March to April to account for additional evidence discovery The government is adding 4 cellphones belonging to Kwon to the stack of evidence Trial still set to begin in January 2026 pic.twitter.com/OALr78EnlY — Zack Guzmán (@zGuz) March 4, 2025 There Is More to Unearth! After reviewing the details, Judge Paul Engelmayer of the Manhattan federal court granted the delay after prosecutors revealed they had discovered an additional four terabytes of evidence, including data from various electronic accounts and third-party entities. This follows a release of 600GB of evidence containing Do Kwon’s phone data, emails, and crypto transaction records. Despite this delay, Kwon’s final trial is still scheduled for January 26, 2026. The court has ordered both sides to submit pretrial motions by July 1, with responses due by August 11. Meanwhile, Do Kwon pleaded not guilty and said he was shocked to see the market reaction post-Terra collapse. The Fallout from Terra’s Collapse Kwon’s legal troubles stem from the dramatic collapse of Terraform Labs’ ecosystem in May 2022. The algorithmic stablecoin TerraClassicUSD (USTC) lost its peg and plummeted below $0.01, triggering panic selling that wiped out $60 billion in market value. The collapse of USTC also dragged down the Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) token, causing widespread investor losses. Following the collapse, Kwon moved between Singapore and Dubai before being arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 while attempting to travel with a fake Costa Rican passport. He served a four-month prison sentence before being extradited to the U.S. in December 2024 . On January 2, 2025, Kwon appeared before a U.S. judge and pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges related to fraud. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: SEC Drops Another Case, And it’s Not Ripple Lawsuit , SEC Takes Action Against Kwon and Terraform Labs In addition to criminal charges, Kwon and Terraform Labs are facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has accused Kwon of misleading investors about the stability of the Terra ecosystem. In April 2024, a jury found both Kwon and Terraform Labs guilty of defrauding investors. Following the verdict, the SEC sought $5.3 billion in fines, citing it as a conservative estimate of the fraudulent gains. The court ultimately imposed a $4.5 billion penalty on Kwon and Terraform Labs, adding to their mounting legal challenges. With more evidence coming to light, the case against Do Kwon continues to unfold, keeping the crypto industry on edge as one of its most controversial figures fights legal battles on multiple fronts. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With stock and crypto markets already in chaos over his new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, Trump doubled down on his support for Elon’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the group leading the charge to gut federal spending and slash jobs. “And Elon is doing a great job,” Trump said. “He didn’t need this. He’s doing America a favor, and we really appreciate it.” Then, in true Trump fashion, he looked over at the Democrats, nodded toward their side, and added, “Even this side appreciates it, trust me. They’re just not gonna admit it.” Across the room, the Democrats had brought along military veterans and former government workers—people who lost their jobs thanks to Elon’s campaign. They held up protest signs that read, “False,” and “Protect veterans.” document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sotu2025.trump_.2a_v2_ec5064k.mp4 Trump appreciates D.O.G.E. Source: WSJ Elon’s D.O.G.E wipes billions in claimed savings DOGE has been on a deletion spree, wiping out claims of savings faster than they appeared. Late Sunday night, the group removed or altered more than 1,000 contracts it had previously said were canceled. That’s over 40% of all contracts listed just a week ago, bringing down its total savings claims from an initial $16 billion to less than $9 billion. Among the deleted entries were five of the seven biggest savings claims DOGE had boasted about. A $1.9 billion IRS contract for tech services? Gone. The New York Times found out the contract had already been canceled under Biden in November. A $149 million contract for three administrative assistants at the Department of Health and Human Services? Disappeared. The numbers didn’t match up, and a completely different contract was mistakenly linked. Another $133 million in so-called savings came from a US Agency for International Development contract for work in Libya. The contractor, Chemonics International, had already wrapped up the project last year. Yet DOGE took credit for canceling it. Even after all these changes, the errors haven’t stopped. As of Monday morning, DOGE’s site still claimed a $106 million savings from two Coast Guard contracts. A quick check of federal records showed those contracts ended back in 2005 and 2006—during the George W. Bush administration. Confusion over D.O.G.E’s Wall of Receipts DOGE had initially launched its “wall of receipts” as a public showcase of all the canceled contracts that supposedly saved taxpayers over $100 billion. But with more deletions happening every week, the list is becoming less reliable. It’s also the only place where DOGE is giving a detailed public breakdown of its numbers, and it’s raising questions about just how accurate their figures really are. After multiple reports from media outlets pointing out the mistakes, DOGE quietly updated its website to shift responsibility. Now, a disclaimer says that all numbers “originate directly from agency contracting officials.” That doesn’t explain why so many of the claims keep vanishing. The shrinking savings total hasn’t slowed down Elon’s operation. DOGE keeps adding new canceled contracts to replace the deleted ones. But these new ones are worth smaller amounts, meaning that the total savings number is still dropping. Meanwhile, contracting and budget experts are raising concerns about DOGE’s overall competence, given how many mistakes keep piling up.

The latest Pepe price prediction remains bleak, following suit with an 80% drop from ATH. The Trump tariff and whale activity decline drove the steep downturn in the PEPE price. Eventually, negative sentiment flooded the market with massive token sell-offs, increasing selling pressure. But a low-cap gem, Panshibi is outperforming with its meme revolution and explosive potential this year. This viral crypto has drawn interest from PEPE investors seeking the next big opportunity for life-changing gains. Let’s dive right in. Panshibi: Low-cap Crypto With True Purpose While the PEPE price remains relatively unstable, Panshibi provides investors with the perfect security during this volatile period. Panshibi’s ace up its sleeves is its innovative approach to meme culture and community-focused initiatives. Since its presale launch, Panshibi has proven to be the lasting upgrade to meme culture’s fickle fad. The token is a panda-inspired meme coin, drawing its uniqueness from the fresh appeal away from the typical dog memes in the crypto market. To sweeten the pot, Panshibi runs an AI-powered social-fi platform where users can earn rewards for socializing with others, participating in quests, and being active community members. Moreover, holders get exclusive access to the Bamboo VIP membership club, where they can receive exciting rewards and perks. Panshibi is excelling where other meme coins are faltering hard. Its AI ingenuity provides value-driven utility a chance for meme enthusiasts to connect and earn passively. Its stake-to-earn program even provides up to 1200% APY that no savvy investors would sideline. All these had the Panshibi presale soaring high when meme stalwarts like PEPE took a dip. Demand for the project is skyrocketing as thousands of investors sink over $1.2M in its potential. The low-cap meme coin is available on presale at a very low price, and its value is expected to keep increasing until launch. Panshibi sells for $0.005 in the ongoing Stage 4 presale, but the $0.026 listing price offers over 400% profits. Panshibi looks like a ripe buy due to its lower volatility and higher growth potential. The meme coin is progressing well on presale and may explode after listing, making today the best time to join the revolution. Pepe Price Prediction: Bears Target 40% Loss As Whales Exit Long Positions Despite the bull’s effort to push the PEPE price out of its adversities, the meme coin made huge losses. Analysts’ lofty PEPE price predictions following its halving event in February all amounted to nothing. The meme token bucked expectations and traded low to new lows at 0.000007263. According to CoinGlass data, this steep drop triggered a wave of $20M liquidations. Several analysts believe this extreme sell-off will continue as whales exit their long positions. A crypto analytics firm reported that a single wallet deposited 430 billion PEPE, valued at $6.39 million, into Binance in February. Another whale offloaded 325.5 billion PEPE, worth $4.9 million, while additional large holders transferred millions more to exchanges. This influx of supply could significantly weaken the PEPE price, leading to a sharp decline. Even the technical outlook echoes the same sentiment, as PEPE recently closed under the 200 EMA on the daily chart. If PEPE maintains its bearish momentum and closes below the EMAs daily, it could extend the decline by nearly 40% from current levels and retest its April 2024 low of $0.00000450. Panshibi Presale: Momentum Builds With The Upcoming Price Surge The window of opportunity in the Panshibi presale is closing fast, especially now that PEPE holders are securing positions. This exciting prospect is currently in Stage 4 out of 15, with tokens selling for just $0.005. Investor interest rises as its presale funds exceed $1.2 million, setting the stage for the next price surge. Act now to join the next meme revolution.

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin were both front-page news during past bull cycles, but Remittix’s explosive growth, with 3.4x returns, is leaving most traders in awe. As meme coins still enjoy huge followings, the question is whether the price momentum can still keep up with upstarts with practical use cases. Shiba Inu’s Ongoing Surge Shiba Inu is in the spotlight again. The token is at $0.00001408, up 1.31% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $8.27 billion. Its 24-hour volume jumped 201.93% to $459.28 million, which is driving rumors that Shiba Inu can be what it once was. Ethereum’s April upgrade can be a fresh catalyst for SHIB according to uKastlFatu’s tweet . In spite of the hype, there are questions regarding how Shiba Inu will perform in an evolving market that values real-world utility more than memes. Trump’s executive order, which named tokens like XRP, SOL, and ADA, did not specifically name meme coins. However, the Shiba Inu community hopes that dedicated supporters and ecosystem expansion will propel another rally. Dogecoin Eyes a Golden Cross Dogecoin is $0.2198 , rising 5.47% in 24 hours, on the back of a 302.87% increase in volume to $4.02 billion. A David Dogecoin post refers to an imminent “golden cross,” as the 100-day moving average is about to cross over the 200-day line. The technical measure in the past predicts a bull price run, and this is stoking hopes that $DOGE will “moon” soon. But Dogecoin’s trajectory is that of Shiba Inu’s—both are subject to social sentiment. While Senator Cynthia Lummis and others worry about institutionally friendly assets for a future US Crypto Reserve, meme coin enthusiasts see each speculative cycle as an opportunity. The real test for Dogecoin is whether its future technical indicators turn into long-term gains. Remittix: The 3.4x Phenomenon Whereas Dogecoin and Shiba Inu follow well-trodden meme coin ground, Remittix has flown below the radar to spoil early adopters with a 3.4x return, thanks to its PayFi bridge between blockchain and real-world finance. Already trading at $0.0694, the token has already sold more than 515 million units, raising almost $13.5 million in presale. Unlike Shiba Inu’s dependence on community frenzy, Remittix is targeting a massive global remittance market through instant crypto-to-fiat conversions. Imagine one South American business owner who imports goods from Asia on a regular basis, for example. With Remittix, they can receive crypto payments, which they can instantly exchange for local currency—no red tape, no secret fees. That’s in contrast to meme coins, whose value swings wildly based on social media opinion. With Remittix, users get actual cost savings and faster transactions, a big draw for businesses and freelancers. The intuitive dashboard makes every transaction into straightforward steps that anyone can follow so that new users can operate the platform without having to understand complex blockchain. If this can be done all over the world, Remittix can be a go-to option for cross-border transactions—a niche most expect to be taken over by tokens like XRP or SOL. With a real-world application, Remittix has overcome market skepticism, even surpassing meme coins that are currently popular in recent times. Meme Coins versus Utility Tokens: Can Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Match Remittix’s Real-World Effectiveness? Meme tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are still near the heart of crypto culture, fueled by passionate communities and meme-worthy events. Yet Remittix’s quick appreciation demonstrates how utility-focused projects can appeal to investors seeking something greater than short-term pumps. Even as the potential for a US Crypto Reserve teeters in the air—maybe to the benefit of XRP, SOL, and ADA—traders are still drawn to meme tokens because of their high-risk, high-reward potential. Whether Dogecoin or Shiba Inu will be able to duplicate a significant rally is a matter of present network innovation, celebrity endorsement, or overall market sentiment. Meanwhile, Remittix quietly advances by solving real-world remittance problems, creating a niche in a rapidly changing crypto environment. The next couple of months will determine whether meme coins will be able to keep dominating or if rational platforms will be leading the next wave of adoption. Take a glance at the Remittix presale to understand how PayFi can revolutionize cross-border payments, while Shiba Inu and Dogecoin fight for meme coin dominance. If Remittix continues on its current path, it could be the next hit story in a market that is known to be turned upside down in one night.

The agency started Trump’s presidency with almost 100K employees, but nearly 7K have been laid off since February 20th. Small business Tax professional and co-founder of The Collaboration Room Mike Sylvester said it was ‘an utterly awful idea’ that could potentially ‘jeopardize’ the agency’s tax collection services. Employees who recently joined the agency without job protections were mostly affected by the layoffs; the rest took Musk’s offer to resign. ‘Losing half of its employees would severely strap the I.R.S., meaning Americans may have to wait longer to receive tax refunds,’ noted the New York Times. The cuts, including normal retirements, are part of the Trump administration’s goal of halving the IRS workforce and all the other agencies across the government. The IRS has not yet specified how quickly the next terminations could take place or how they will affect each department. IRS officials have reportedly delayed some ‘firings’ until spring when the busy period will end. The agency is in the middle of reviewing the U.S. citizens’ tax returns during this year’s ‘annual filing season’. Losing half of its staff presents a tough challenge for the IRS Apparently the IRS has been directed to come up with a plan to reduce their workforce to 45,000. This is cutting it in half during a time when 90,000 is not enough due to the 50 year old technology the IRS has been saddled with. As a tax professional, this is an utterly awful… — Mike Sylvester, CPA (@FortWayneCPA) March 5, 2025 The IRS has reportedly struggled for years with hiring and retaining employees that could process millions of tax returns every year and conduct complex audits. However, the agency was directed to come up with a plan to reduce their workforce to 45,000. U.S. citizens may soon have to wait longer to receive refunds or speak with I.R.S. employees in future filing seasons. Corporations and wealthy Americans may also face less scrutiny from the understaffed tax agency. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) led by Gavin Kliger and Sam Corcos working from its Washington headquarters, has reportedly taken a keen interest in the IRS in recent weeks in connection with Musk’s cost-cutting effort. D.O.G.E continues to push for access to the IRS databases, which include the most recent records with information about the agency’s contractors. “This is cutting the IRS in half during a time when 90,000 is not enough due to the 50 year old technology it has been saddled with” – Mike Sylvester IRS leadership has been in ‘turmoil’ since the layoffs began and two leaders have already stepped down under President Trump. Melanie Krause, the current acting commissioner at the IRS, reportedly put the chief human capital officer at the I.R.S. on administrative leave this week. IRS ‘disproportionately’ harms enforcement efforts Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said on a Thursday call with reporters that the IRS layoffs would disproportionately harm enforcement efforts. According to the latest IRS data, the IRS employs roughly 90K workers across the United States. People of color account for nearly 56% of the IRS workforce, and women represent about 65%. The layoffs likely meant the end of ‘the agency’s plan to go after super-rich tax dodgers and could spell disaster for revenue collections’. The majority of the employees shown the door at the IRS so far were newly hired workers focused on compliance, which includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code and paying delinquent debts, among other duties. A union representing Treasury Department employees warned on Thursday that the IRS layoffs were one of the largest purges of probationary workers across the government this year, and it could hurt customer service and tax return processing during tax season . Former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and six other former commissioners strongly opposed the planned downsizing, also warning that it could severely impact the agency’s ability to function. However, employees directly involved in the 2025 tax returns season have allegedly been barred from accepting Musk’s buyouts until after the April tax filing deadline in mid-May. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem formally requested IRS personnel in February to reassign some IRS employees to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assist with immigration enforcement.

If momentum persists, Solana could reclaim key resistance levels and reassert itself as one of the top-performing assets of this cycle. Meanwhile, Rollblock is revolutionising blockchain gaming by merging traditional casino experiences with Web3 technology in its play-to-earn ecosystem. As the iGaming industry rapidly expands, RBLK is positioning itself as a top contender, with the potential to skyrocket in value much like other breakout gaming tokens in 2021. Why Rollblock Could Become The Next Big Gaming Giant Rollblock is reshaping blockchain gaming, bringing next-level innovation to a rapidly expanding industry. With over 7,000 games ranging from traditional casino classics to cutting-edge blockchain exclusives, the platform delivers a rich and engaging gaming experience tailored to a global audience. Sports betting has further enhanced Rollblock’s ecosystem, adding another layer of entertainment and accessibility. With nearly $11 million secured in its tenth presale stage and a fast-growing community of 50,000+ members, Rollblock is establishing itself as a premier player in iGaming and blockchain-based entertainment. The RBLK token is central to Rollblock’s long-term sustainability, driving engagement and rewarding users. Up to 30% of platform revenue funds strategic buybacks, with 60% of repurchased tokens burned to create scarcity and 40% distributed as staking rewards, reinforcing value appreciation. Rollblock prioritizes security and compliance, operating with an Anjouan Gaming license and undergoing a rigorous SolidProof audit. Equipped with AI-powered fraud detection and advanced encryption, the platform ensures a safe, transparent, and fair gaming environment for all users. Here’s The Rundown On Solana Following The US Crypto Reserve News Solana has remained a dominant force in the market, benefiting from strong institutional interest and its growing role as a retail haven in the crypto ecosystem. However, recent setbacks, including the Libra meme coin scandal and an impending 11 million Solana token unlock, have raised some concerns despite wider bullish news. Adding to market speculation, CME Group has announced the launch of Solana futures , indicating further institutional interest. This move could pave the way for a spot Solana ETF, with firms like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pushing for regulatory approval. If approved, this would solidify Solana’s position as an elite cryptocurrency alongside Ethereum. Investor sentiment remains mixed, however, with some traders fearing further downside if Solana loses key support at $130. For instance, crypto trader Ali Martinez has warned that Solana breaking below this level could trigger a 52% drop to $65 . Despite recent volatility, Solana’s long-term prospects remain promising. Solana continues to be the leading blockchain for meme coins and decentralized applications, attracting both high-risk traders and serious developers simultaneously. With regulatory developments on the horizon, Solana could easily emerge as one of the top-performing assets in this bull cycle.

The publicly listed company, already known for its proactive Bitcoin strategy, just announced a significant addition to its treasury. Buckle up as we dive into how Metaplanet is doubling down on Bitcoin, acquiring a whopping 497 BTC and solidifying its position as a corporate Bitcoin champion. What does this mean for the future of corporate Bitcoin investment and the broader crypto landscape? Metaplanet’s Bold Move: Adding 497 BTC to its Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet’s latest announcement sent ripples through the financial markets as they revealed the purchase of another 497 Bitcoin. This substantial acquisition isn’t just a minor top-up; it’s a powerful statement of belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Let’s break down the key details: Significant Purchase: Metaplanet has acquired 497 BTC, adding considerably to their already substantial BTC holdings . Growing Treasury: With this latest purchase, Metaplanet now holds a total of 2,888 BTC. This makes them one of the most prominent publicly listed companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Public Announcement: The news was shared via X, highlighting the company’s transparency and engagement with the crypto community. This move begs the question: Why is Metaplanet so aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, and what are the potential benefits for the company and its investors? Why Bitcoin Investment is at the Heart of Metaplanet’s Strategy Metaplanet’s dedication to Bitcoin isn’t a fleeting trend; it’s a core element of their corporate strategy. But why are they so bullish on Bitcoin? Here are a few compelling reasons: Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and traditional economic downturns. In a world of fluctuating currencies and economic instability, Bitcoin offers a decentralized and limited-supply asset. Long-Term Value Proposition: Metaplanet likely views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. They are not just trading Bitcoin; they are accumulating it, indicating a belief in its appreciating value over time. Diversification and Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin diversifies Metaplanet’s treasury beyond traditional assets, positioning them as an innovative and forward-thinking company in the eyes of investors. Potential for Higher Returns: Compared to traditional low-yield assets, Bitcoin offers the potential for significantly higher returns, although with increased volatility. This strategic Bitcoin investment aligns Metaplanet with a growing number of companies recognizing the potential of digital assets. But what makes Japan such an interesting location for a company leading the charge in corporate Bitcoin adoption? Japan : A Crypto-Friendly Hub for Innovation Japan has long been recognized as a forward-thinking nation when it comes to technology and finance. Here’s why Japan ‘s regulatory environment and technological landscape make it fertile ground for companies like Metaplanet to thrive with their corporate Bitcoin strategy : Progressive Regulations: Japan has established relatively clear and progressive regulations for cryptocurrencies, providing a degree of legal certainty that encourages innovation and investment in the crypto space. Tech-Savvy Population: Japan boasts a highly tech-savvy population with a strong understanding and adoption of digital technologies, including cryptocurrencies. Financial Innovation Hub: Japan is a major global financial center, fostering an environment conducive to financial innovation and the integration of new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Government Support for Blockchain: The Japanese government has shown support for blockchain technology and its applications, which indirectly benefits companies operating in the cryptocurrency sector. With Japan as its base, Metaplanet is strategically positioned to leverage the country’s crypto-friendly environment to further its corporate Bitcoin strategy . But how does Metaplanet’s BTC holdings compare to other companies, and what are the broader implications of this trend? Analyzing Metaplanet’s BTC Holdings and the Corporate Bitcoin Trend Metaplanet’s BTC holdings are not just a number; they represent a significant shift in corporate treasury management. Let’s put their holdings into perspective and explore the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin strategy : Company Estimated BTC Holdings Strategy MicroStrategy ~214,000+ BTC Primary Treasury Reserve Asset Metaplanet 2,888 BTC Treasury Diversification and Growth Tesla ~9,720 BTC (estimated) Diversification, Payments (Previously) Block, Inc. ~8,038 BTC Treasury Reserve and Ecosystem Support As you can see, while MicroStrategy remains the leader in corporate Bitcoin strategy , Metaplanet’s BTC holdings are substantial and growing. This trend signals a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. What are the potential benefits and challenges for companies adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy ? Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Embracing a corporate Bitcoin strategy comes with both exciting opportunities and significant considerations. Let’s weigh the pros and cons: Benefits: Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin’s potential for price appreciation can significantly boost corporate treasury returns, especially in a low-interest-rate environment. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation, preserving the real value of corporate assets over time. Brand Innovation: Adopting Bitcoin can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, attracting investors and customers who value technological advancement. Decentralization and Security: Bitcoin offers a decentralized and secure alternative to traditional financial systems, reducing reliance on intermediaries. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can lead to significant fluctuations in the value of corporate holdings, requiring robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty: While Japan is progressive, regulatory landscapes for cryptocurrencies vary globally and are constantly evolving, posing potential compliance challenges. Accounting and Tax Complexity: Accounting for and taxing Bitcoin holdings can be complex and requires specialized expertise. Security Risks: Safeguarding large BTC holdings requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Despite these challenges, Metaplanet’s continued Bitcoin investment underscores their belief that the benefits outweigh the risks in the long run. Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin Right for Your Corporate Treasury? Inspired by Metaplanet’s corporate Bitcoin strategy and wondering if Bitcoin is right for your company’s treasury? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Conduct Thorough Research: Understand Bitcoin, its underlying technology, and its market dynamics. Educate your team about the risks and rewards. Assess Risk Tolerance: Evaluate your company’s risk tolerance and financial stability. Bitcoin investments should align with your overall financial strategy. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives for Bitcoin investment . Are you looking for a hedge, long-term growth, or diversification? Implement Robust Security: If you decide to invest, prioritize security. Use cold storage solutions and implement best practices for digital asset management. Stay Informed and Adapt: The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about regulatory changes and market trends, and be prepared to adapt your strategy as needed. Conclusion: Metaplanet Leads the Charge in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 497 BTC is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a resounding endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic corporate asset. As they boldly expand their BTC holdings , Metaplanet is setting a precedent for other companies to consider the potential of corporate Bitcoin strategy . While challenges remain, the potential rewards of Bitcoin investment , including enhanced returns, inflation hedging, and brand innovation, are increasingly compelling.

In a series of recent developments, the White House has announced its support for congressional efforts to overturn an IRS rule targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, while also preparing to host a high-profile crypto summit. The summit, set to take place in Washington, DC, will bring together key industry leaders, including executives from Coinbase, Kraken, and Chainlink, to discuss the future of digital assets in the US. Trump Administration Backs Effort to Rescind IRS DeFi Broker Rule The White House has announced its support for congressional efforts to overturn the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that classifies decentralized finance (DeFi) software providers as brokers. The move, championed by AI and crypto czar David Sacks, signals the Trump administration’s commitment to fostering innovation in the digital asset space while pushing back against regulatory measures deemed restrictive to the industry. In a March 4 post on X, Sacks expressed the administration’s support for resolutions led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Representative Mike Carey under the Congressional Review Act. These resolutions seek to repeal an IRS rule that expands the definition of a “broker” to include software providers facilitating access to DeFi protocols. Sacks noted that senior advisers to President Donald Trump would recommend signing the joint resolution, S.J. Res. 3, into law should it reach the president’s desk. “This rule, issued as a midnight regulation in the final days of the previous Administration, would stifle American innovation and raise privacy concerns over the sharing of taxpayers’ personal information, while imposing an unprecedented compliance burden on American DeFi companies,” read a statement from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on March 4. The IRS rule, introduced in December 2024 before Trump took office, was met with swift opposition from the crypto industry. Critics argue that the policy, set to be implemented in 2027, could drive companies offshore and hinder innovation within the DeFi sector. Under the IRS framework, a DeFi platform facilitating digital asset exchanges and exerting influence over transactions could be classified as a broker. This classification would subject such entities to rigorous reporting obligations. The IRS estimates that between 650 and 875 DeFi brokers would need to start collecting and reporting user data beginning in 2026. Crypto advocacy groups, lawmakers, and industry leaders have criticized the policy as overly broad and inconsistent with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. They argue that forcing DeFi platforms to comply with broker regulations contradicts the fundamental principles of decentralization and financial autonomy. Trump Administration’s Crypto-Friendly Stance Since assuming office in January, the Trump administration has taken a proactive stance toward digital assets. With Republicans controlling both the Senate and House of Representatives, several crypto-friendly legislative proposals have emerged. Trump has already signed multiple executive orders aimed at supporting the industry and reducing regulatory burdens. The push to rescind the IRS DeFi broker rule represents a broader shift in regulatory approach under the current administration. By supporting resolutions to overturn restrictive measures, the White House signals its willingness to work with the crypto sector to create policies that promote growth while addressing concerns around compliance and oversight. While the fate of the IRS rule now lies with Congress, industry leaders remain optimistic that the Trump administration’s support will lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. Trump to Host Crypto Summit with Industry Leaders at White House In related news, the White House is set to host a highly anticipated crypto summit, bringing together some of the most influential figures in the digital asset industry. President Donald Trump will personally address the gathering, which will include top executives from leading crypto firms such as Coinbase, Kraken, Chainlink, and Paradigm. The summit shows the administration’s growing commitment to making the United States a global leader in the cryptocurrency space. Among the high-profile attendees confirmed for the event are Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, and Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. A spokesperson for Chainlink verified Nazarov’s attendance, while representatives from Coinbase and Kraken also confirmed Armstrong and Sethi’s participation. In addition, Strategy founder Michael Saylor, Exodus CEO JP Richardson, and Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang are slated to attend, according to announcements made on X on Tuesday. “I look forward to discussing how America can take a leadership role in promoting the principles of open crypto and enabling builders in ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana,” Huang stated. The summit, chaired by AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, will be directed by Bo Hines, who leads Trump’s working group on digital assets. The event is scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. ET, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Trump administration’s recent pro-crypto stance marks a significant shift from previous regulatory approaches. Over the past few weeks, the president has made several statements indicating that his administration aims to position the US as the “crypto capital.” One key topic expected to be discussed at the summit is Trump’s proposed Crypto Strategic Reserve , a working group initiative designed to establish a digital asset reserve comprising “US-based coins.” This would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select altcoins such as Solana, Cardano, and XRP. While Trump’s proposal has been met with enthusiasm in some circles, critics have questioned the inclusion of certain altcoins, arguing that Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain higher decentralization and developer activity. Regulatory Changes and the SEC’s Retreat The timing of the summit coincides with sweeping changes at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Since former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s departure in January, the regulatory landscape has shifted notably. The agency has dropped lawsuits against several major crypto firms, including Kraken, Consensys, and Coinbase, and has ended probes into companies such as Gemini and Yuga Labs. On Tuesday, market maker Cumberland DRW confirmed that the SEC had agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against the firm, marking yet another significant legal victory for the crypto industry. These developments suggest a regulatory thawing, which could pave the way for greater institutional adoption and innovation in the sector. The White House’s move to host a crypto summit is widely seen as an attempt to align US policy with the interests of blockchain innovators and investors. In a statement on Saturday, the administration emphasized its commitment to fostering a more welcoming regulatory environment for digital assets. “After the previous administration unfairly prosecuted the digital asset space, President Trump’s policy vision represents a new era for digital financial technology,” the statement read. With major industry leaders gathering in Washington, the crypto community is watching closely to see whether this summit will lay the foundation for new policies that could solidify the US’s role as a global crypto hub.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|LINK|TECHNOLOGY|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-05 06:00:00

According to a tweet from Bybit, the exchange’s users can now mint, redeem, and earn USDe on Bybit On-chain earn, an ongoing campaign. Ethena Labs also shared a tweet to commemorate the partnership, explaining that the new development allows Bybit users to mint and redeem USDe natively without leaving the platform.

This is expected to help support deeper liquidity on the exchange. According to Ethena Labs, “this feature perfectly complements Bybit USDe holders’ ability to earn rewards for holding USDe as well as using it as derivatives margin collateral.” The tweet ended with Ethena Labs highlighting how committed it and Bybit are to creating innovative user experiences and further improving users’ capital efficiency. An interface of a direct swap between Tether’s USDT and Ethena Labs’ USDe. Source: Ethena Labs With the Bybit integration, USDe gains a larger user base, making it an even bigger contender in the stablecoin race, which is getting more serious as the crypto industry hedges closer to mass adoption. Aside from the partnership with Bybit, Ethena’s USDe has also been enjoying recent popularity in the industry as several other entities seem bullish on it. Last month, MEXC cryptocurrency exchange invested in Ethena as part of a broader push to promote stablecoin development and adoption. MEXC made the announcement on February 26, claiming it allocated $20 million to Ethena’s synthetic US dollar, USDe, and $16 million to developer Ethena Labs. Like Bybit, the exchange also launched a $1 million reward pool to encourage participation in USDe trading and staking. It is not hard to see why MEXC made such a huge commitment. The exchange’s chief operating officer, Tracy Jin, believes stablecoins have a “pivotal role” to play in promoting cryptocurrency usage and adoption. USDe has a circulating supply of nearly $5.4 billion, making it the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. More good news for Ethena Labs’ USDe MEXC’s investment followed Ethena reportedly closing a $100-million funding round backed by major investors, including the famed Franklin Templeton. According to a Bloomberg report, the fundraising was financed via a private sale of Ethena’s governance token, ENA and the funds will be used to build a blockchain and token for the traditional finance industry. According to Ethena Labs’ founder, Guy Young in a January blog post, Ethena has plans to deploy iUSDe, a token with the sole purpose of regulating financial institutions. This token differs from USDe in that it is designed to “export” the benefits of USDe to traditional finance institutions. In short, its purpose is to bridge crypto yields with regulated financial markets. iUSDe shares the same delta-neutral stability mechanism as USDe which means it maintains its peg by collateralizing stablecoins and taking futures positions with large open interest. However, it also includes “transfer restrictions” to comply with TradFi regulatory requirements. It is essentially a wrapped version of sUSDe created specifically for institutional use. So, while USDe is available for regular users, iUSDe will be restricted to approved institutional players via partnerships with TradFi distribution channels. As far as yield is concerned, it will offer a similar yield to sUSDe, which is around 10-20%. However, it’s being touted as a “savings token” for institutions to access without direct blockchain exposure.

One of them is Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer of Maelstrom. In fact, Hayes likes it so much, he has revealed that his digital asset fund has raised its exposure to USDe “to record levels.” USDe is already popular, but now that yield-bearing stablecoins appear to be gaining ground, it is expected to become even more attractive. Back in February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security from Figure Markets. The forthcoming YLDS stablecoin will allow users to earn interest payments on their holdings and experts think it signals the regulator’s intent to accommodate the rapidly growing stablecoin market. According to Figure Markets CEO Mike Cagney the application was submitted to the SEC more than one year ago. However it was most likely not taken seriously by the previous SEC administration as it eliminates the need for traditional finance. “If I can hold this [stablecoin], if I can self-custody this, if it pays me interest, and I can actually use it to transact, what do I need a bank for?” Cagney said.

The decline came after a wave of profit-taking, following initial optimism around President Trump’s U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement on Mar. 2. Solana ( SOL ) surged to $179, before plummeting to $130 as the market reacted to Trump’s confirmation that tariffs on Canada and Mexico will take effect on Mar. 4. Despite the volatility, Solana’s DEX sector remains strong. According to DeFiLlama data , Solana topped DEX volume for the fifth consecutive month, hitting $109 billion, which was 24% higher than Ethereum ( ETH ). Even though the memecoin trading market has cooled , platforms like Raydium ( RAY ), Meteora, and Orca are still driving huge trading volumes. On the technical front, the 9-day EMA is acting as resistance, indicating bearish momentum. Support is located at $136, while key resistance levels are at $150.05, $166.32, and $179.01. At 39.65, just above oversold zone, the relative strength index indicates the possibility of a brief recovery. Solana technical analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although there has been a spike in trading activity recently, the overall trend is still downward. SOL may try to recover toward $166 if it breaks above the $150 level. However, it could drop further if current support is not maintained. You might also like: Solana loses over $5 billion in TVL since all-time high, will SOL recover?

Ripple’s long-running battle with the SEC might finally be nearing its end. Rumors of an imminent dismissal or settlement have sparked a buying frenzy, pushing XRP up over 23% in the past 24 hours. Some analysts even believe a resolution could send it soaring over the $20 mark. While XRP dominates headlines, StratoVM (SVM) could make its own mark in the BTCFi sector. Its dedicated Layer-2 solution has pushed an impressive 6240% price surge in just 14 days, defying the recent red trend. Let’s check out the details! Ripple XRP News: Could Drop of SEC Lawsuit Triggering a XRP Rally to $20? Traders are turning bullish as the SEC acknowledges more spot XRP ETF filings, fueling hopes for regulatory progress. XRP has jumped over 15% since closing at $2.32 on Feb. 6, driven by excitement over CoinShares’ ETF application via Nasdaq. This is the fourth spot XRP ETF to get an initial nod, following filings from Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Brazil’s securities commission approved the country’s first spot XRP ETF from Hashdex, though it’s not trading yet. Despite the rally, XRP futures traders are still hesitant – open interest dropped over 78% last week after XRP fell 26% in early February. Even with a 20% price rebound, OI has only climbed by $600 million after losing nearly $4 billion. This suggests lower trading volume is pushing the rally, making it more vulnerable to volatility. Analyst Amonyx predicts the SEC-Ripple lawsuit will be settled soon, triggering a “god candle” that could send XRP to $20 within 10 days. If legal clarity combines with ETF momentum, XRP might finally break out in a big way. StratoVM (SVM) Could Capture a Large Share of the BTCFi Market StratoVM (SVM) is developing a Layer 2 blockchain on Bitcoin that might enable smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi apps directly on the Bitcoin network. CoinGecko shows StratoVM trading at around $0.173, which represents a 6240% increase in just two weeks. This surge might show its strength during market ups and downs, possibly because it could help solve Bitcoin’s scaling issues. The team plans to launch their mainnet soon, which could mark a big step forward. Compared to other Bitcoin Layer 2 projects like CoreDAO (valued at roughly $990M), StratoVM sits at $2 million suggesting room for future growth. DefiLlama reports that BTCFi protocols have grown from about $307 million in January 2024 to roughly $6.6 billion in February 2025. StratoVM might tap into this with its approach to Bitcoin scaling. The project’s listing on UniSwap could boost its credibility as something worth watching more closely. StratoVM has built a network of over 50 strategic partners, which might help drive future growth and innovation. Some reports suggest a possible listing on a centralized exchange (CEX), which could be good news for the project. The community seems interested, with nearly 100,000 followers across its official X , Telegram , and Discord channels. The testnet shows amazing early results, supporting over 113,000 registered wallets and processing more than 56,000 daily transactions. As Bitcoin grows beyond just “digital gold,” StratoVM’s scaling and security features might help it capture part of the growing BTCFi market. With the mainnet launch just around the corner and these features in place, SVM might secure additional exchange listings after its official debut. Final Thoughts If the SEC settles with Ripple, XRP could finally break free from legal uncertainty and push toward the $20 milestone. With ETF buzz growing and speculation heating up, all eyes are on its next move. While XRP grabs headlines, StratoVM (SVM) could bring innovation in the BTCFi field. StratoVM grew 6240% in just 14 days, attracting liquidity and developer interest. This article is not financial advice.

With the ETH price and the price of Solana poised to see some gains soon, many investors are keeping an eye on them. With the recent US crypto reverse announcement, both these tokens may surge quickly. Even market experts like Crypto Rover and Ray have made bold price predictions for these top crypto coins. IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making headlines with its great crypto ICO event performance. This presale star, now in phase ten, has already rewarded early buyers with a 911% return. But a Tier-1 CEX listing is coming soon, which will bring another massive rally. Not only that, but IntelMarkets will also bring the future of crypto trading using AI technology, making it a powerful force in this space. Thus, it could even have a higher upside than ETH and SOL. IntelMarkets (INTL) Stuns Traders With a 911% Return With the ETH price and the price of Solana potentially soaring, IntelMarkets (INTL) is making waves, too. This presale has raised over $11M so far and could hit $13M before this month ends. Investors who got in early are now 911% richer—a percentage that will rise soon as the eleventh phase of the crypto ICO event starts and a Tier-1 CEX listing comes. The INTL token will power the IntelMarkets trading platform. This platform is also making headlines as it aims to use AI tech to stand out from peers like Coinbase. On IntelMarkets, users will get access to self-learning trading robots that do not make the same mistake twice and the Intell-M® channel analysis tool, which provides consolidated insights from over 10K data platforms. Thus, countless traders are waiting for the launch of IntelMarkets. INTL costs just $0.091 but this value will hit $0.10 after phase eleven of its presale begins. Also, a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap will trigger a rally to $0.11. In other words, those who buy this crypto coin now will get a 20% return. This growth could pale in comparison to what INTL may see if it follows the same trajectory as other promising exchange tokens like BNB did. The ETH Price Will Explode Soon, Analyst Claims Ethereum (ETH) is one of the best cryptos, but it has faced some turbulence recently. CoinMarketCap shows that its value has dropped from around $3,000 to nearly $2,000 in the past 30 days. In other words, the ETH price has fallen over 30% in just a few short weeks. However, market expert Crypto Rover remains bullish for Ethereum (ETH). According to his X post, the bottom is in, and the ETH price may skyrocket soon. He even says that the ETH price will explode like Bitcoin’s. This Ethereum price prediction has made some waves, but many traders are still skeptical. This is because its high market cap of around $250B means a lot of new money needs to roll in for the ETH price to soar. As a result, traders are choosing to focus on INTL instead. Ray: The Price of Solana (SOL) May Hit $1,000 Although one of the top 10 altcoins, Solana (SOL) has also shown red price charts. In the past 30 days, the price of Solana fell over 35% as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value dropped from around $210 to nearly $130. The community is watching Solana (SOL) thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Ray. In a recent X post, Ray said that the price of Solana could reach $1,000 soon. This Solana price prediction has turned many heads in the market. Nevertheless, many investors are skeptical about this price of Solana movement prediction. This is because its high market cap of around $70B. As the price of Solana may see slower gains, a lot of traders are looking at INTL as an alternative. IntelMarkets (INTL) vs. Ethereum (ETH) vs. Solana (SOL) – Which Crypto Coin Stands Out? IntelMarkets (INTL), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) could all see big price gains in 2025. But, a lot more eyes are set on IntelMarkets. This project introduces groundbreaking technology that taps into the growing AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. As a result, its long-term growth potential and stability may be better. Additionally, the smaller market cap of INTL means faster price gains while the price of Solana and the ETH price could see slower growth. Due to all these factors, investors look at INTL as the best crypto investment for fast returns this year.

BTFD Coin’s Presale and Explosive 3,650% ROI Projection Say It’s Time to Get In",https://thecoinrise.com/watched-brett-hit-0-235-btfd-coins-presale-and-explosive-3650-roi-projection-say-its-time-to-get-in/,"Meme coins have become a goldmine for early investors, turning small bets into life-changing profits overnight. Brett ($BRETT), the official mascot of Base Chain, took off in spectacular fashion, soaring to an all-time high of $0.235 just three months ago. Many traders who sat on the sidelines watched in disbelief as early holders cashed in big, proving once again that catching the right meme coin at the right time is the key to serious gains. Now, with Brett’s momentum shifting and new opportunities emerging, all eyes are on BTFD Coin. With a $6.25 million presale tally, over 71 billion tokens sold, and a projected moon price of $0.006, BTFD is shaping up to be the next meme coin explosion. As one of the top cryptos to join for short term , it offers investors a golden opportunity to get in early before the hype fully takes off. Those who regret missing Brett’s breakout have a chance to redeem themselves, but they’ll have to act fast—Stage 14 is live, and this price won’t stay for long. BTFD Coin—The Next Meme Coin to Watch BTFD Coin is more than just hype; it’s got the numbers and the momentum to back it up. Its presale has already raised over $6.25 million, with a rapidly growing investor base of over 11,200 Bulls. Analysts are buzzing about its potential, predicting a massive 3,650% ROI once it hits the projected post-launch price of $0.006. Unlike Brett, which many only discovered after its major run-up, BTFD Coin is still in its early stage, giving investors a rare second chance at catching a winner before it skyrockets. To put things into perspective, let’s say you invest $15,000 in BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016. Once it lists at $0.0006, that investment could turn into $56,250. And if the moon price projection of $0.006 holds? You’re looking at over $562,500—the kind of gains that could fund a brand-new car, a luxury vacation, or even set you up for early retirement. With numbers like these, it’s no surprise that BTFD Coin is being recognized as one of the top cryptos to join for short term, offering investors a prime chance to capitalize before the real surge begins. The opportunity is here, but like every meme coin rally, it won’t wait forever. BTFD isn’t just about speculation—it has real incentives driving its growth. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, launched on January 1, 2025, lets users earn rewards in $BTFD, adding a fresh utility layer that most meme coins lack. On top of that, staking rewards offer a jaw-dropping 90% APY, making it one of the most lucrative passive income opportunities in crypto right now. The Bulls Squad community is thriving, bringing together thousands of investors who recognize the best new opportunities in meme coins with 100x potential before the mainstream catches on. Getting in on BTFD’s presale is as simple as setting up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, funding it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and connecting your wallet to the presale page to purchase tokens before the presale ends. Over 71 billion tokens have already been claimed, and with each stage pushing the price higher, waiting too long could mean paying more later. Brett Exploded to $0.235—Will It Happen Again? Brett made a name for itself as the official mascot of Base Chain, drawing inspiration from Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comics. It capitalized on the growing hype surrounding meme coins, riding the wave of Base Chain’s popularity to reach its all-time high of $0.235. Investors who got in early watched their holdings multiply in value, proving once again that meme coins can generate insane profits when they catch fire. But as with any meme coin, timing is everything. The real money is made by those who buy before the hype peaks. Brett’s price action has cooled since its ATH, and while it remains a strong player in the Base Chain ecosystem, the biggest gains often come from spotting the next breakout star before the rest of the market catches on. That’s exactly where BTFD Coin comes into play. Looking at the patterns in meme coin history, it’s clear that early-stage investments bring the highest returns. Brett rewarded its early adopters, but now BTFD Coin is sitting at a low presale entry point with the potential for a massive rally post-launch. Those who missed Brett’s climb to $0.235 don’t have to sit out on another moonshot—BTFD Coin’s presale is still open, but not for long. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin has all the elements of a high-reward, early-stage investment. Its presale numbers speak for themselves, with over $6.25 million raised, 71 billion tokens sold, and a community of more than 11,200 Bulls backing its success. With a projected listing price of $0.0006 and a moon price target of $0.006, investors have a clear path to 3,650% ROI potential. The biggest regret in crypto isn’t the coins you sell too early—it’s the ones you never buy at all. Brett reached $0.235, and many watched from the sidelines as it happened. This is the chance to avoid making the same mistake twice. As one of the top cryptos to join for short term, BTFD Coin is gearing up for its biggest run yet, and the investors who act now will be the ones celebrating when it hits new all-time highs. Join BTFD Coin’s presale before it’s too late. FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the top cryptos to join for short term? BTFD Coin’s explosive presale, 3,650% ROI potential, staking rewards, Play-to-Earn game, and strong community backing make it a major contender in the meme coin space. How does BTFD Coin compare to Brett’s run to $0.235? Brett’s rally proved the power of meme coins, but BTFD Coin is still in presale mode, meaning investors can enter at a much lower price with the potential for bigger gains post-launch. How can I buy BTFD Coin before the presale ends? Buying BTFD is easy. Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, connect to the presale page, and purchase BTFD tokens before the price goes up.

41178515,https://nulltx.com/?p=146525,1741158959,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Dogecoin’s 2021 Chart Mirrored in DTX Exchange, But Can This Presale Star Surpass DOGE’s ATH by Q2?",https://nulltx.com/dogecoins-2021-chart-mirrored-in-dtx-exchange-but-can-this-presale-star-surpass-doges-ath-by-q2/,"2021 marked a historic rally for meme coins with the Dogecoin price soaring to great heights thanks to social media and viral buzz, but a new challenger is following an identical path. DTX Exchange, a new concept in DeFi and TradFi, is moving forward similarly to DOGE in its initial months of skyrocketing. However, analysts wonder if DTX can exceed DOGE’s ATH throughout the market. Read on to find out more. DTX Exchange Gains Momentum Among Retail and Institutional Investors The Dogecoin price volatility has pulled investors toward more stable and high-growth opportunities like DTX Exchange . The platform aims to unite stocks, bonds, ETFs, options, forex, crypto, and commodities in a new hybrid trading environment to give traders a diversified financial environment. VulcanX, a Layer-1 blockchain designed for speed and efficiency, is at the heart of its innovation. It can process more than 200,000 transactions a second (TPS) and ensures trade execution without congestion and delays, a problem that has bedeviled centralized and decentralized exchanges. With speed no longer a problem, traders can concentrate on profiting without network slowdowns. DTX Exchange is unique in integrating with different blockchain protocols, creating liquidity pools and cross-chain asset trading. Deep liquidity access opens up more market opportunities for traders while preserving asset liquidity so they can be traded across ecosystems. Unlike traditional exchanges that suffer from inefficiencies, DTX is a hybrid model that combines the best of centralized platforms with decentralized finance’s transparency and user control. Traders get institutional-grade security, instant order execution, and full asset ownership. For those seeking leverage, DTX raises the bar with 1,000x trading power. A $100 position can control up to $100,000 in assets, offering a level of market exposure rarely seen elsewhere. Whether trading forex, stocks, commodities, or top altcoins, users have a unique opportunity to amplify potential gains. Beyond its trading features, DTX Exchange is introducing an automated investment manager tailored to both active and passive investors. It simplifies wealth-building while reducing market stress by allowing strategic portfolio growth through automated micro-investments and risk-adjusted allocations. Security remains a top priority, and DTX achieves this by adopting a non-custodial wallet system. Traders control their private keys, and their assets are never subjected to third-party failures. This particular self-sovereign approach matches the core ideas of blockchain technology. The DTX presale has already surpassed $15.5 million, drawing in thousands of investors eager to get in early. With the listing price set to increase soon, now is the last opportunity to secure a 100% token bonus. Investors using the code “LIST2X” at checkout will see their holdings double, effectively securing a 4x return instead of the standard 2x post-listing. This positions DTX holders for more gain than DOGE. Dogecoin Price Faces Uncertainty as Investors Shift to Other Projects The Dogecoin price has recently hiked to $0.24 before retracing to $0.21, depicting a 5.89% surge on the daily charts. The trading volume has registered a 286% surge to $3.95 billion; however, the discrepancy in network activity has raised some worries. Dogecoin’s Unspent Transaction Output, which indicates user involvement, has fallen by 89% since the end of 2023. Besides, the outgoing idling addresses, which were 2.66 million in November 2024, had been reduced to just 130,280 in February 2025, which means the number had decreased by 95%. Source: CoinMarketCap This decline suggests a waning interest in transactions and uncertainty about the sustainability of the Dogecoin price. Without a rebound of user activity, DOGE could lose its grip on the market. The bearish sentiment extended to long-term holders, who cut their positions by 2.67%, and mid-term holders, who sold off 11.81%. All these exits signal increasing volatility in the Dogecoin price and an unwillingness of investors to stick around. Technically speaking, the Dogecoin price must remain above the $0.19 support zone for the rest of the week. If DOGE breaks through key resistance levels, analysts expect a long-term target of $4, which is 1,900% above current levels. This move will take DOGE’s market cap to $575 billion, which isn’t entirely impossible. While DOGE has shown historical resistance, uncertainty has driven many holders to DTX Exchange, a hybrid trading platform that is fast gaining traction. Nonetheless, DOGE is still causing panic speculations; traders are mainly enthusiastic about those tokens with actual value and growth prospects instead. Conclusion With the continued uncertainty in the Dogecoin price, DTX Exchange is improving its leading position as the best trading platform. With the presale priced at $0.18 and the token launching at $0.36, DTX token holders can 4x their investments using the code “LIST2X” at checkout to secure massive early-stage profits. With the Dogecoin price facing uncertainty, DTX offers a more secure financial future.

41178517,https://nulltx.com/?p=146531,1741159012,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, And This Utility Coin — Which One Will Dominate Q2?",https://nulltx.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-and-this-utility-coin-which-one-will-dominate-q2/,"As the second quarter of 2025 moves closer, investors are on the lookout for the asset that will lead the next cycle. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are two top meme coins, but the question now is whether they are still worth the hype. Meanwhile, a new player is quietly rising and proving itself in its publicly available presale. DTX Exchange is showing a pathway for serious growth beyond speculation. This is because it boasts a platform with extraordinary real-world use cases. So this article takes a closer look at Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and the promising future of DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Utility Coin Gaining Traction DTX Exchange focuses on innovation and aims to remove the gap between traditional finance and blockchain. DTX gives access to a vast array of over 120,000 assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex. This is powered by the hybrid layer-1 Vulcan X blockchain, which also brings features like the Phoenix Wallet, capable of holding a diverse range of assets. This way, DTX ensures a highly efficient trading experience. And to prove its security, the platform has cleared a SolidProof audit. The project has already secured over $15.5 million during its presale phase, attracting the support of over 700,000 early investors. It is currently priced at $0.18 in its bonus presale round and its expected listing price has jumped from $0.20 to $0.36. Moreover, unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu that have high circulating supplies, DTX’s token supply is capped at 475 million tokens, adding scarcity value. With a very well-defined roadmap coupled with gradually increasing adoption, DTX Exchange now has all the chance in the world to become a leader in this crypto space. Will Dogecoin (DOGE) Be More than Just a Meme? Dogecoin has survived mainly due to its loyal fanbase and some spurts of excitement. But 2025 hasn’t been great for DOGE holders. Over the past month, Dogecoin’s price has dropped more than 30%. It recently saw a 9% price increase in the last 24 hours, but that doesn’t change the poor price range as it currently trades at $0.22. There has been talk of possible Dogecoin ETFs, but some experts are skeptical. Some believe meme coin ETFs could be risky and compare them to gambling speculations rather than legitimate investments. So the biggest issue with Dogecoin still remains the lack of more utility. While it is accepted by some merchants for payments, its price movements are still largely driven by speculation and look unlikely to compete with the new intriguing utility coin, DTX. Shiba Inu (SHIB) in a Struggle to Stay Relevant The price of Shiba Inu has also been moving downward. The price just saw a slight 24-hour increase of 3.9% and currently trades at about $0.14. Investors are still looking for bigger moves, especially when it has already fallen by 25% over the past weeks. Admittedly, the Shiba Inu team has been working hard to move away from being just a meme coin. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 scaling solution, has processed over 250M transactions so far, reducing fees by 90% and burning 12B tokens. A recent UAE ministry partnership is also leveraging ShibOS, which is built on Shibarium, for public services. Shiba Inu also recently launched “SHIB: The Metaverse,” drawing more than 100K+ users to virtual worlds of gaming and more. But these efforts are yet to result in major price increases. Conclusion Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have shined in the past, but their reliance on speculation makes them risky bets. DTX Exchange, on the other hand, is built on utility. With its growing user base, strong security measures, and clear development plan, it could be poised for serious growth as we approach Q2.

As Bitcoin loses strength, investors are looking towards high-momentum altcoins, and DTX is at the forefront. With an upcoming listing and a 2x bonus offer before launch, early buyers have a very rare chance to double up even before it reaches major exchanges. Many believe this could be the best time to enter before prices surge. Bitcoin Price is Struggling, Time to Look Elsewhere? The Bitcoin price is having a hard time increasing, and the majority of traders are worried. CoinMarketCap data shows that Bitcoin price is stuck at key levels, and the sellers are stopping it from rising further. Some analysts say that this could be a sign that Bitcoin’s better days are coming to an end. As a result of this, people are now resorting to other coins that can appreciate faster and bring higher profits. One of the strongest picks out there right now is DTX Exchange. Unlike Bitcoin, DTX is new, fast, and set to rise. It can handle 200,000 transactions per second, making it much stronger. Currently, DTX Exchange is in its final presale stage, and users who use “LIST2X” get double the tokens right away. This is a 100% profit before it even goes live on major exchanges. With Bitcoin prices struggling, DTX Exchange could be the next giant altcoin in the cryptocurrency market. Cardano Price Shows Strength; Can It 10x in March? Cardano has been gaining traction as a high-performing altcoin. Recent data shows that Cardano’s price has held strong support, and analysts predict that it could see a massive 10x increase this March. Source: CoinMarketCap With growing adoption and new upgrades, Cardano is proving to be a top choice for investors looking for big gains. If momentum keeps building, Cardano’s price could break out fast, leaving slow-moving assets behind. But as an investor, if you want even bigger returns, DTX Exchange is where the real money is. Unlike Cardano, which is already a big coin, DTX Exchange is in its final presale stage at just $0.18, with a listing price of $0.36. That means investors can double their money instantly before it even goes live. DTX is not just a token, it’s a full exchange, built for speed, security, and massive liquidity. SUI Blockchain Could 10x in March, Here’s Why SUI Blockchain is growing fast, and experts say it could be 10x this March. According to a recent market analysis, SUI Blockchain has a strong trading volume and rising demand. More people are using SUI Blockchain because it is fast, cheap, and built for the future. If this trend continues, SUI Blockchain could be one of the best coins to watch this year. But DTX could be an even bigger winner. Unlike SUI Blockchain, DTX is still in presale at just $0.18, but its listing price is $0.36, meaning early buyers instantly double their money. Even better, using “LIST2X” gives investors twice the tokens, making profits even bigger. DTX Exchange: The Only Token Offering Instant 4X Gains Before Listing Imagine buying a token at $0.18 and having it listed at $0.36, that is 2X your money already. But what if you could get 4X? That is what DTX Exchange is offering currently. Investors who use the “LIST2X” code during the final presale phase get double the tokens, which makes their gains even higher before the token even goes live. DTX Exchange uses a non-custodial model, that is, you have 100% ownership of your assets, and there is no third party that holds your funds. This is safer than centralized exchanges that have been hacked and had funds frozen in the past. Another massive aspect of DTX is its revenue-sharing mechanism. Holding DTX tokens gives investors a share of the platform’s profits, so they can make passive income just by holding. This is in contrast to Bitcoin price, which only depends on market volatility. With DTX, users are rewarded while waiting for the price to increase. This makes it one of the few crypto projects that reward holders in multiple ways. As Bitcoin weakens, traders are looking for improved alternatives like Cardano, SUI Blockchain, and DTX Exchange. While ADA and SUI have good potential, DTX is offering something superior yet; instant 2X gains, non-custodial model, and an overall passive income. As crypto investors shift their focus, DTX Exchange is standing out as the best new opportunity in March.

Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has seen notable price swings recently. In the past week, its price has dipped by 4.03%. Over the last month, the decline is sharper at 30.33%, highlighting a significant short-term downturn. However, looking back six months, SOL has actually grown by 26.38%, indicating long-term positive momentum despite recent drops. Currently, Solana trades between $142.98 and $197.24. The nearest resistance level is at $215.66, and the closest support level is $107.14. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $164.65, while the 100-day SMA is slightly lower at $146.41. The Relative Strength Index sits at 49.16, signaling a neutral market, but the Stochastic indicator at 17.80 suggests the asset may be oversold. These indicators point to potential for a price rebound. If SOL climbs to the nearest resistance at $215.66, it would mark an increase of about 26% from its current price around $170. A drop to the support level at $107.14 would mean a decrease of approximately 37%. Breaking through the resistance could propel Solana towards the second resistance level at $269.92, indicating significant growth potential ahead. Conclusion Solana and others excel in the bull run, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans and meme culture, aiming for significant growth and community empowerment.

With an RSI of 67.28, it’s climbing steadily, suggesting more room for growth. Over the past 6 months, XRP’s price surged over 400%, reflecting strong market interest. If it breaches the resistance at $3.68, the next target could be $4.73. The coin’s recent weekly rise of over 9% hints that investors are still bullish. The current market conditions suggest that XRP could soon see another leg up. Cardano (ADA) on the Verge of a Breakthrough Cardano is gaining momentum, with prices ranging between $0.76 and $1.33. Recent trends suggest a potential run towards the nearest resistance level of $1.52. The Relative Strength Index is high, which signals strong buying pressure. Cardano’s price change over 1 week is near 38%, while the 6-month rise is over 230%. This suggests a robust upward trajectory. If the surge continues, ADA might test the second resistance level at $2.08, indicating a further upward potential of around 56%. Keep an eye on the support level at $0.39, as it acts as a safety net against any sudden dips. Current indicators and momentum position Cardano favorably for a bullish move. Conclusion While XRP and Cardano show less potential for short-term growth, Catzilla emerges as a promising opportunity. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale stages, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016, Catzilla offers governance features, loyalty incentives, and staking options.

What’s his plan, and why does Africa have a special meaning for Tether? Ardonio’s announcement On March 2, 2025, Ardonio took to X to tell about his vision of how to tackle the power crisis in Africa. He stated that 600 million Africans don’t have access to electricity and shared his vision of a possible solution. Ardonio suggested that there is a “plan underway.” He believes a network of kiosks with high-performance batteries and eco-friendly solar panels attached to the top can be a remedy. People will be required to buy a monthly subscription to recharge the batteries using these kiosks. They will be able to pay for it in local currency, Bitcoin, or USDT. Kiosks will provide electricity for the local community. Up to 2023, 600 million people in Africa lacked access to electricity. Imagine a kiosk in Africa, with solar panels on top to recharge hundreds of high performance batteries, offering monthly subscription to the local community (payable in local currency, Bitcoin LN or USDt).… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) March 2, 2025 The network is going to be deployed in at least two phases, with ten thousand charger locations built in the first stage. In the second stage, the number of locations will be brought to 100k. On top of providing the residents with electric power, the kiosks will provide high-quality educational materials and courses on Bitcoin and saving in Tether. More than that, Ardonio mentions “the biggest distribution network for any goods and services.” On March 3, Tether CEO added that the described plan “is not an [sic!] hypothetical,” and “few hundred kiosks are up and running.” In the comment section, Ardonio added that after Tether does power generation, it will work on infrastructure. Reactions The announcement was met with a full spectrum of reactions–from skeptical to full approval. For instance, Blocksteam CEO Adam Back expressed the willingness to broadcast his company’s educational materials about Bitcoin using these kiosks. Several commenters outlined potential problems of the enterprise or questioned Tether’s role in such an initiative. One of the commenters, Mutasco, pointed out that the decentralization spirit aligns more with creating a framework where incentives would have driven various independent actors to build such kiosks, not the company itself building the entire network. He added that the Tether Foundation could have probably come up with the framework. “This balances autonomy with centralized support that creates alignment with the ethos of building a community-owned network,” said Mutasco. In the spirit of decentralization, is this mission under a framework designed under some operator model structured as a decentralized, incentive-driven system where independent local operators can act as ambassadors and facilitators? Perhaps, Tether can support the framework… — Mutasco (🐝) (@Cryptic_Chelsea) March 3, 2025 Another commenter, who goes by the moniker Crouching Tiger Hidden Whale, questioned if the residents would be able to pay for the subscription. More than that, Crouching Tiger expressed concerns over the safety of Tether’s enterprise, saying that locals could potentially “hijack” the kiosks to use battery rechargers without the paywall. To these concerns, Ardonio noted that several hundred locations are already working and “so far so good.” Hmm.. cool concept, but do those local people have any actual income to pay for the subscription/service? 😅 And if so, is it enough to cover the capex of building it all out? 🤔 And if not… what happens if some more “enterprising” locals hijack the whole solar… — Crouching Tiger Hidden Whale (b/acc) 🍊🌋🐳 (@hidden_whale) March 2, 2025 The telecom companies reps showed up in the comment section to praise the initiative and promote their services, indicating the importance of connectivity. One of them said that in 2019, he and his partners installed two airnodes in a small remote fishing village in Tanzania, and the move proved to be very effective as now the village has tripled in size, and people feel safer and have more opportunities for selling fish. Tether in Africa and America It’s worth saying that Tether has always been vocal about its role in Africa and other regions where people lack banking and tools for saving money in stable currencies. The company’s website directly points to Africa, South, and Central America as the regions where Tether “empowers millions,” saving families “from the spiraling devaluation of their local currencies.” The USDT use has significantly grown in Africa since 2022. Bloomberg cites Tether’s Head of Economics, Philip Gradwell, who says that the main use cases of Tether in Africa are in saving value and sending money abroad. https://crypto.news/chainalysis-stablecoins-represent-40-of-crypto-economy-in-sub-saharan-africa Facilitating financial opportunities in developing countries has an accompanying mission of stretching the American dollar’s influence in these regions. Tether is one of the world’s biggest buyers of U.S. Treasury bills, so the company emphasizes its role in contributing to the elimination of the U.S. debt and galvanizing the American economy as well. The latter becomes especially relevant today when the company is facing increased scrutiny in the U.S. While the new crypto-friendly SEC consistently keeps on dropping one Gensler-era case by another, Tether finds itself in a much more heated place now than before 2025. The new GENIUS Act aimed to regulate stablecoins demands more transparency from Tether, a company that was never subjected to audits made by the big four audit companies. Some experts believe that Tether won’t be able to adhere to the rules and will have to leave the U.S. market. The U.S. Treasury is considering sanctioning Tether as it provides services for sanctioned nations like Russia and Iran and the terrorist organization Hamas. Another concern is the involvement of Tether in funding the North Korean nuke program. In October 2024, WSJ reported that federal prosecutors are investigating possible violations of sanctions and anti-money-laundering laws. The January 2024 UN report shows that Tether is one of the preferred cryptocurrencies for crime and money laundering. The report names $17.07 billion as a sum of USDT spent on illegal activities between September 2022 and September 2023, which is not a huge share of the Tether overall volume but a good excuse to intensify the scrutiny and potential prosecution. In the face of a possible withdrawal from the U.S., increasing its influence in other regions and shifting the focus from the USD-pegged stablecoins to Bitcoin may prove to be an effective recovery plan for Tether.

This latest buy bumps its total stash to 2,888 BTC, worth over $251 million, with Bitcoin hovering around $87,198 at press time. The Japanese firm bought the dip as Bitcoin dropped over 8% on March 4 as concerns regarding a potential trade war and fresh tariffs from the U.S. continued to rattle markets.

It’s also now the 12th-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally.

Despite some volatility last week as Bitcoin slumped, Metaplanet’s stock remains one of the best performers, boasting gains of over 1,700% on a yearly timeframe. This marks the Tokyo-headquartered firm’s second BTC buy for the week.

The FIU of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission hosted a meeting to discuss countermeasures against new money laundering methods. Let’s explore the potential strategies South Korea may employ and their implications for the global crypto landscape. South Korea’s FIU Enhances AML Laws: What to Know According to the latest media report , South Korea is set to undergo a significant regulatory revamp, with a focus on strengthening Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This move comes in response to the increasing number of money laundering cases and crypto crimes. On March 5, 2025, the Financial Intelligence Unit under the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea convened a meeting. Notably, the AML Inspection Trustee Council chaired by FIU Head Park Kwang, concentrated on examining AML regulations and shared inspection plans with key agencies. The regulators remain dedicated to tackling crypto thefts and new money laundering methods. AML Inspection Trustee Council: Top Discussions Notably, South Korea’s FIU is taking proactive steps to combat novel money laundering methods such as virtual accounts and easy remittance abuse. As per the FIU’s findings, these crimes have been facilitated by the establishment of cryptocurrencies. Significantly, FIU’s AML Inspection Trustee Council prioritizes standardizing AML inspection procedures. This is to rapidly disseminate critical risk factors associated with money laundering. The recent meeting concentrated on the necessity of revamping AML rules in response to the growing crypto threats. Along with Chief Park, AML inspection officers from 11 key institutions, including the Financial Supervisory Service, Ministry of the Interior and Safety, and Korea Federation of Mutual Savings Banks participated in the meeting. The discussion centered around two main objectives: fortifying measures against crimes that affect livelihoods and establishing annual inspection operation plans tailored to each institution. This development comes on the heels of Upbit Operator Dunamu’s appeal against the FIU. Dunamu sought to cancel the FIU’s business suspension order. South Korea Fosters User Protection: Key Strategies As part of the current program, South Korea’s FIU is planning to establish a ‘People’s Livelihood Crime AML Joint Response Team’ in collaboration with the Financial Supervisory Service and other financial institutions. The team’s efforts will center on detecting AML vulnerabilities and implementing measures to strengthen resilience against financial crimes. South Korea’s current initiatives align with the global trend of regulatory reforms to combat crypto crimes. The US SEC is making efforts to establish a regulatory framework that guarantees both crypto growth and user protection. The European Union is also taking proactive measures to foster a healthy crypto environment. These enhanced regulatory measures are a direct response to the mounting cryptocurrency fraud. Recently, the crypto space suffered a major blow with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack , a breach that ranks among the largest crypto thefts ever.

Further, the exchange will implement security protocols to ensure asset protection. “To ensure the highest level of protection for seized assets, we have deployed a specialized team armed with advanced security protocols,” said CoinDCX co-founder Sumit Gupta. CBI and ED Seize Nearly $200M in Major Cryptocurrency Fraud Cases Authorities have ramped up enforcement following large-scale cryptocurrency fraud cases. In the GainBitcoin case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) carried out searches across multiple cities. The investigation focused on an alleged multi-crore scam tied to a Bitcoin-based multi-level marketing scheme. During these raids, the agency seized cryptocurrencies worth ₹23.94 crore (about $2.88m), along with documents and electronic devices that are currently being analyzed for evidence of financial misappropriation and cross-border transactions. Similarly, in the BitConnect scam, the ED seized digital assets worth ₹1,646 crore (about $198m) last month. The scam defrauded investors worldwide. As a result, authorities raided multiple locations across Gujarat. They confiscated ₹13.50 lakh (around $16,250) in cash, an SUV and several digital devices. Following a two-day search of over 60 locations in India's major cities, the police confiscated $2.75 million worth of #crypto in connection to the #GainBitcoin scam. #CryptoScam #India https://t.co/3cGVdjqFdR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 26, 2025 Tighter Crypto Regulations Aim to Protect Investors from Fraudulent Schemes “CoinDCX has been cooperative and assisted in the seizure process, providing valuable support in the investigation led by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

The deal includes measures aimed at reducing the country’s Bitcoin exposure. Despite the agreement, El Salvador has continued to increase its Bitcoin portfolio. The El Salvador government has continued its effort to bolster the country’s economy with Bitcoin. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) however, has expressed concern for the country’s financial stability as cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. In 2024, the El Salvador government agreed to scale back on its Bitcoin ambitions in exchange for a much-needed billion-dollar loan. The deal with the IMF included measures such as businesses in El Salvador no longer being mandated to accept Bitcoin and the payment of taxes in US dollars and not cryptocurrency. However, El Salvador President, Nayib Bukele is now reneging on the deal and sticking to his Bitcoin strategy. El Salvador’s $1.4B deal In 2024, the IMF released a statement saying that in exchange for the financial aid program to support the government’s economic overhaul agenda, the El Salvador government agreed to implement measures to mitigate bitcoin-related risks. The decision to make Bitcoin a legal tender in the country was met with cheers from crypto enthusiasts, but it caused a delay in the country receiving financial support from the IMF as there were concerns about the volatility of crypto assets. The IMF believed that the introduction of Bitcoin as a legal tender would cause further decline in the finances of El Salvador, an already impoverished and indebted nation. The government of the country did not share these concerns and set its Bitcoin ambitions in motion, purchasing one Bitcoin daily since November 2022. While the country’s adoption of Bitcoin became more accepted over time, problems like the volatility of digital assets and the lack of understanding of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has led most of the population to opt for the US dollar for their transactions. This, of course, did not deter the government from building its Bitcoin reserve. Data indicates that the El Salvador government now holds approximately 6,101 BTC, valued at around $527 million at current market prices. The country’s latest acquisition of 19 BTC is a lump sum accumulated over multiple previous purchases made in January and February, even after the IMF agreement was finalized. proof of whining.'"" width=""1272"" height=""1570"" /> El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio. Source: The Bitcoin Office The IMF’s financial aid agreement with El Salvador includes specific measures to limit the government’s involvement with Bitcoin. These measures include a ban on new acquisitions, so it was expected that the country would stop its Bitcoin acquisition. However, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele is clearly ignoring these restrictions. Bukele posted on social media platform X that the country’s Bitcoin purchases would continue. “This all stops in April. stops in June. This all stops in December. No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining,” He said . “This all stops in April.” “This all stops in June.” “This all stops in December.” No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most “bitcoiners” abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining https://t.co/9pC0PoY3YQ — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) March 4, 2025 The IMF has not made any comments regarding Bukele’s disregard for the agreed terms. As a part of the deal, the El Salvador government is required to publish all wallet addresses used for Bitcoin transactions. Audited financial statements must also be released for crypto-related government entities. The Fidebitcoin trust fund must also be liquidated by July 2025, in accordance with the agreement. The trust fund was originally established to support Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. The government is also expected to withdraw from direct involvement in the country’s official Bitcoin payment platform, the Chivo Wallet system. The agreement between the IMF and El Salvador is anticipated to draw in supplementary funding from the World Bank and other regional development banks. The country’s $1.4B deal with the IMF is expected to snowball into $3.5B with the support from these other financial organizations. The IMF said in a release that, “the program is also expected to catalyze additional financial support from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and other regional development banks (Central American Bank for Economic Integration, CABEI, Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean, CAF) for a combined overall financing package of over US$ 3.5 billion over the program period.” El Salvador is now looking into alternative strategies Although Bukele’s strategy started with Bitcoin adoption, it has expanded over time to include the booming AI and tech industry. The government is adjusting the regulatory framework and pushing policies that are sure to attract tech companies and improve the country’s economic future. On March 2, official accounts posted photos of Bukele’s meetings with Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen, the co-founders of a16z, discussing technology and AI investment opportunities.

El Salvador wants to become a regional tech hub and a leading destination for entrepreneurs and investors. To achieve this, El Salvador is offering incentives such as a 0% tax rate for companies in tech industries. Tether , the issuer of the world’s largest USDT stablecoin has already migrated its head office to the Central American nation. The government also created the National Artificial Intelligence Agency (ANIA). This agency operates under the Office of the Presidency to oversee AI-related activities in the country.

Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen Discusses Future & Security,https://coingape.com/brandtalk/opinion/will-crypto-wallets-replace-exchanges-trust-wallet-ceo-eowyn-chen-discusses-future-security/,"With no doubt, the crypto industry has witnessed remarkable growth in 2024, with over 562 million people worldwide owning various forms of digital currencies. This accounts for approximately 6.8% of the global population, according to crypto ownership data from Triple-A. As Web3 adoption accelerates, Crypto Wallets are also evolving beyond simple storage solutions into multifunctional financial tools. The global crypto wallet market, valued at USD 8.42 billion in 2022 by Grand View Research, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8% from 2023 to 2030. The critical role of Web3 wallets in safeguarding digital assets further came into focus following the recent $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, exposing vulnerabilities in Web3 wallet infrastructure. Safe{Wallet}, an institutional multi-signature smart contract wallet provider, has recently acknowledged its role in one of the largest thefts the crypto world has ever seen. As crypto wallets gain wider adoption, CoinGape speaks with Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen in this exclusive opinion piece on the evolving role of crypto wallets and the need for an improved user experience. She also discusses essential security measures for Web3 wallets, particularly in light of Safe{Wallet}’s acknowledgment of its infrastructure’s role in the Bybit hack. Crypto adoption doesn’t happen in a vacuum—it happens when people can seamlessly integrate crypto into their everyday lives. That’s why wallets are no longer just storage tools; they’ve got to evolve into personal companions that help users buy, store, and use crypto in a number of ways that feel intuitive and natural,” says CEO Eowyn Chen. At Trust Wallet, we believe adoption starts with ease of usability and a real sense of security. If interacting with crypto is complicated or feels risky, most people won’t take that first step. A Web3 wallet should make self-custody effortless, giving users full control over their assets while ensuring a secure and frictionless experience. Web3 Wallets’ Evolving Role beyond just as ‘Crypto Storage tools’ In their jouney of evolution since 2009, crypto wallets are becoming more user-friendly and intuitive to attract mainstream users. Though in the early days, wallets were used primarily to store and transfer Bitcoin and early altcoin, today with the rise of smart contract, they are acting as Web3 gateways for various digital services. From the early days of Bitcoin Core and Paper wallets in 2009, we are witnessing the rise of Centralised Exchange hybrid wallets and In-app/in-device wallets such as Trust Wallet’s mobile based approach. Major exchanges such as Binance, OKY, Kraken and Bybit have integrated self-custodial crypto wallets within their CEX applications. Further, following the Solana Saga Phone’s success, there is also an influx of hardware-based Blockchain products which feature in-built crypto wallets. The days of wallets being just “crypto vaults” are over. As the industry evolves, wallets are becoming the gateway to everything on-chain —whether it’s swapping tokens, participating in DeFi, exploring NFTs, or managing digital identity or even the AI data economy to come soon. But with this expanded role comes responsibility. Cautioning, CEO Chen further says, “But with this expanded role comes responsibility. A Web3 wallet must also be secure, reliable, and easy to use, ensuring that anyone—whether a first-time user or an experienced trader—can confidently engage with blockchain technology. As we adopt more users, the user profile and needs also become more diverse than before. As such, a useful wallet also needs to be personal – understanding the users’ needs and stages in their journey to better serve them.” Owing to the rising players in the Web3 wallet space, there is also an increasing competition among the CEXs, Web3 Fintech and Web2 messaging applications such as Telegram. Vying for acquiring a greater user base with increased crypto adoption, these players are continuously working on improving user experience. I believe that user experience (UX) is the foundation of driving widespread adoption in the Web3 space. A great UX isn’t just about seamless functionality—it’s about ensuring users feel secure, confident, and empowered as they explore the decentralized world,” says Trust Wallet CEO. Are Crypto SuperApps the future of Crypto Wallets As the leaders in the industry are working on improvising user-interface by providing access to various decentralized applications (dApps) directly on users’ wallet, the role of crypto wallets is set for further expansion. A 2024 Report by Binance on ‘The Future of Crypto Wallets’ in fact projected that the wallets can follow on the lines of ‘Browser Wars’ of Web2 in near future. They can soon transition from just financial tools to comprehensive tools for managing various digital services akin to browsers with greater access to third-party dApps. In Web2, we have seen many such remarkable expansions and growth, viz., Uber, Grab, Musk’s X – to name a few. More than ever, people want a seamless way to interact with Web3 without the technical complexity. The next generation of wallets will remove friction—users won’t have to worry about which blockchain they’re on, how gas fees work, or whether they need multiple platforms to swap tokens or stake assets. Everything will just work. As wallets evolve, their role will go beyond transactions. They will help users manage their digital lives effortlessly, making Web3 more accessible, intuitive, and secure for everyone. Will Crypto Wallets end up in replacing Exchanges Recently, in an interaction, Binance CEO and founder, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, opined that wallets can replace exchanges for everyday Crypto use. CZ stated, “Most people shouldn’t have to use an exchange,” indicating that wallets are better suited for routine crypto activities. He suggested that crypto exchanges should serve as liquidity pools for large traders, rather than platforms for everyday users. C On the question of replacing exchanges, Trust Wallet CEO Eowyn Chen says, “CZ has an interesting point. A lot of what you can do with web3 platforms like Trust Wallet overlaps with what exchanges have traditionally been known for. Buying and selling crypto, for example, is something users can do directly within Trust Wallet through our trusted partners—without needing to go through a centralized exchange. Many people also hold their crypto on exchanges, which is convenient but comes with risks, especially in light of recent security breaches and platform failures. This is what makes using a self-custody wallet so attractive—it gives users full ownership and control over their assets, rather than relying on a third party to safeguard them. When CZ mentioned the point, he thinks Centralized exchanges should focus on serving trading scenarios. So far the performance, experiences, and fees on CEX are still better than DEXs. But still, during this cycle, we have observed a significant increase in DEX trading volumes, reaching well over $500 billion in January 2025, according to DefiLlama . So do DEXs impose a threat onto CEX? I think so. Can it fully replace CEX? I hope so, but we will see how the industry evolves. Though the fact that centralized exchanges and self-custody wallets serve unique purposes, and both have a role to play in the broader crypto ecosystem, can’t be denied. CEXs users prefer using an exchange for having a third party control over their funds and assured security, while those who prefer latter prioritize self-control. Bottleneck in Web3 Wallet Security Infra The recent Bybit Hack and the subsequent acceptance of Safe Wallet about the role of its fault infrastructure in the stealth theft, exposes the major security bottlenecks yet to be resolved in the Web3 Wallet infrastructure. On solutions, CEO Chen says, “to stay ahead, wallet providers must act proactively: conducting regular security audits not only within their own systems but also across third-party integrations to catch vulnerabilities early, and deploying real-time monitoring to spot anomalies like unusual transaction patterns. These aren’t new ideas—they’re proven practices from Web2 and traditional finance. Looking forward, wallet security will mean smarter risk detection, better recovery options, and stronger authentication—think of it as technology that anticipates threats before they strike. But for us, it’s bigger than that. It’s about giving users the confidence and tools to thrive in Web3. That’s the future we’re building at Trust Wallet. We’re investing heavily in features like our built-in security scanner and real-time monitoring, while also prioritizing user education to help our community navigate risks with clarity.

What to Expect ? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News US President Donald Trump is making waves in both the financial and crypto markets with his latest move. On Sunday, March 2, the crypto market saw a significant rally after Trump announced that five major cryptocurrencies- Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Ethereum would be added to the US’s new strategic reserve. This initiative aims to position the US as the “Crypto Capital of the World.” Historic Crypto Summit! But that’s not all. A historic event is set to happen this Friday, March 7, as Trump will host the first-ever White House Crypto Summit , marking a key moment for both US politics and the crypto industry. David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, will organize and manage the summit, with Bo Hines, the executive director of the working group, assisting. President Trump will lead the event. Sacks revealed that key founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto world will meet with Trump’s digital assets working group at the White House to dive into crucial discussions on crypto policy and potential regulations. Key Attendees and Topics In Focus The summit will focus on key topics like the US strategic reserve’s role in crypto, setting industry guidelines, expanding stablecoin oversight, opposing a US CBDC, and creating a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” with major cryptocurrencies. It will also explore regulatory frameworks to support growth, balance regulation with innovation, and consider tax-free crypto sales to boost adoption. The White House Crypto Summit will feature key figures like President Trump, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov, and others. Other crypto leaders like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Jesse Powell and the Winklevoss twins may attend. In the 119th Congress, some Republican lawmakers have introduced competing stablecoin bills, aiming to establish a regulatory framework for these digital assets. However, Democratic lawmakers have criticized President Trump for launching the $TRUMP memecoin shortly before his inauguration, alleging potential conflicts of interest and ethical concerns. Nevertheless, the summit seems to be the first major gathering of digital asset leaders at the White House. Under Trump, the SEC has halted investigations and enforcement actions against many digital asset firms. These changes align with the Trump administration’s broader efforts to foster innovation and position the U.S. as a leader in the cryptocurrency sector.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 07:41:32

Originally set for March 6, the hearing is now rescheduled for April 10, according to a March 3 ruling from Judge Paul Engelmayer. The decision followed a February 27 letter from prosecutors indicating they expected to provide an additional four terabytes of discovery to the defense. Newly Acquired Evidence Includes Data from Warrants and Third-Party Documents The newly acquired material reportedly includes evidence obtained through warrants on several electronic accounts, as well as documents from third-party organizations and individuals. Prosecutors explained that they had already supplied Kwon’s team with approximately 600 gigabytes of data, including information from four of his cellphones and emails from both his personal and corporate accounts. Moreover, details related to Kwon’s extradition, the FBI’s retrieval of evidence in Montenegro, statements made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and records of digital asset trading activity have been shared with the defense. The Terra ecosystem’s collapse in May 2022 wiped out an estimated $60 billion in market capitalization. Its algorithmic stablecoin, TerraClassicUSD (USTC), lost its dollar peg, plummeting below one cent. The sudden destabilization, accompanied by heavy sell pressure, also contributed to Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) losing the majority of its value. Kwon, who is of South Korean nationality, spent months traveling between Singapore and Dubai before arriving in Montenegro, where authorities apprehended him in March 2023. He had allegedly attempted to depart for Dubai using fraudulent travel documents. Following a four-month prison term, negotiations between Montenegrin authorities and the United States resulted in Kwon’s extradition last December. For those asking, I can confirm Do Kwon's status conference has been pushed back from March to April to account for additional evidence discovery The government is adding 4 cellphones belonging to Kwon to the stack of evidence Trial still set to begin in January 2026 pic.twitter.com/OALr78EnlY — Zack Guzmán (@zGuz) March 4, 2025 He made his first appearance before a U.S. court on January 2, pleading not guilty to nine felony counts, all tied to alleged fraud. Despite the postponement of his next hearing, Kwon’s trial remains on track for January 26, 2026. Pretrial motions are due by July 1, with responses to those motions required by August 11, as set forth by the court. Judge Signs Off on $4.5B Terraform, Do Kwon Settlement with SEC In June last year, U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) approved a settlement that will require Terraform Labs and Kwon to pay a staggering $4.5 billion in disgorgement and civil penalties. Additionally, they will be permanently banned from engaging in any transactions involving “crypto asset securities,” which includes tokens within the Terra ecosystem. The settlement came after initial proposals from the SEC suggested a $5.3 billion penalty, which Terraform Labs contested by advocating for a maximum fine of $1 million. Ultimately, on June 6, the legal representatives for both Kwon and Terraform Labs agreed to the SEC’s revised settlement offer of $4.5 billion. Terraform Labs, currently operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, faces the challenge of how to fulfill the substantial financial obligations imposed by the settlement.

The event will be hosted by Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks , and industry leaders are hoping for regulatory clarity that could help the US retain blockchain talent and foster domestic crypto business growth following years of oppression under the previous administration. On March 5, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett said that “invites were sent to attendees via email this afternoon,” meaning Tuesday. However, there were no further details in the missive beyond time and location, she said. NEW: A little more detail here — invites were sent to attendees via email this afternoon.

The gathering of around 20-25 people will be a roundtable setting at the White House and include other members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, which is why the industry invites will be fewer, she added. Aside from Sacks and the Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, Bo Hines, it was unclear who else would attend on behalf of the government. However, the President’s Working Group on crypto also includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and the chairs of the SEC and CFTC. “A larger, invite-only reception is being planned across the street from the White House after for those not invited to the roundtable meeting.” Also on the list of attendees are Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital, Zach Witkoff, the co-founder of the Trump family DeFi platform World Liberty Finance, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi. An unconfirmed list of invite recipients was also posted, which included Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, Circle boss Jeremy Allaire, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, Vitalik Buterin, and the Winklevoss twins. However, these people have yet to be officially confirmed. Potential discussion topics include establishing a US crypto reserve , stablecoin oversight, potential tax incentives for crypto businesses, and AI’s role in crypto fraud detection and compliance. Ethereum Representation? Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano commented on Ethereum representation, considering that Trump’s DeFi platform is based on and buying ETH, Coinbase’s layer-2 and stablecoin are Ethereum-based, and Robinhood and Kraken are working closely with Ethereum L2s. “Would love to have someone from Etherealize in the room (hopefully Danny Ryan) but Ethereum does have pretty good representation already.” Core Ethereum developer Ryan responded with, “I think I could do an excellent job broadly representing Ethereum’s interests in this kind of environment.

While Trump's addition of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to the reserve, XRP, ADA and SOL, drew the reaction of industry leaders, Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter stated that Trump's crypto reserve plan contains eight risks and listed these risks. Nic Carter argued that Trump’s proposed cryptocurrency reserve could harm both Bitcoin and the U.S. government, arguing that the five-cryptocurrency reserve proposal undermines Bitcoin’s value proposition and serves personal interests. “1. Reserve plan rollback risk: Without congressional approval, a future administration could easily reverse policy and disrupt the market. 2. Dollar market instability: Tying cryptocurrencies to US reserves could shake confidence in the dollar and Treasury markets. 3. Limited need for Bitcoin exposure: The US already benefits from more BTC than any other country through investor tax benefits. American funds and individuals also hold more Bitcoin than citizens of other countries. 4. No strategic use case: Unlike oil or rare minerals, crypto reserves do not serve a core function for national security or economic stability. 5. Potential devaluation of BTC: Mixing Bitcoin with rival crypto assets Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and XRP and giving them all equal government approval would devalue Bitcoin and make it appear undifferentiated from those assets. It would undermine BTC’s unique decentralization. 6. Bitcoin doesn’t need a government: BTC has become a multi-trillion dollar asset without government intervention; government support can politicize it. 7. Public backlash: With only 5-20% of Americans owning $BTC, investing taxpayer money in crypto reserves could lead to unnecessary public backlash. 8. Conflicts of interest may increase: Trump and his allies hold a variety of crypto assets. Concerns are growing that the Reserve is using government resources to increase the value of coins held by Trump and many in his inner circle. Nic Carter recently warned that Trump’s diversified US crypto reserve plan could backfire, undermining BTC’s independence and leading to political instability. *This is not investment advice.

AAVE tokens are up 21% in the past 24 hours, beating a 3.5% bump in the broader market tracked by the broader CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , as a successful passage of the proposed changes could bump the fundamentals of holding aave tokens. The so-termed “Aavenomics update” was initially green-lit in August 2024. Aave’s cash pile has ballooned by 115% to $115 million since mid-2024, with the platform’s GHO stablecoin hitting a $200 million supply and reporting strong revenues. And Aave wants to give back some of those figures to users. A key proposed point is to increase profit sharing for people who stake their AAVE tokens to support the system. Next is Anti-GHO, a special token that can’t be traded but can be used in two ways: burn it to wipe out GHO debt (like paying off a loan for free) or turn it into staked GHO (StkGHO) for extra rewards. Anti-GHO will come from half of GHO’s revenue, which stands at $6 million a year based on GHO’s $12 million annual haul. The DAO proposes a “buy and distribute” program that aims to deploy $1 million a week to buy AAVE tokens from the open market, aiming to keep its value steady and reward users long-term. The buybacks can begin immediately and could grow in six months. On the technical side, the DAO proposes “Umbrella,” a self-protection system that shields users from losses if the market crashes. “Aave will be the only protocol able to protect users from bad debt up to billions, as competitors have essentially given up on protecting their users,” the proposal read. “This unique advantage will make Aave even more attractive, especially for institutions concerned with on-chain risks. Community feedback is open on the proposal as of Wednesday morning, and a formal on-chain proposal will be floated in the coming weeks.",Markets|Aave|DAO|tokenomics,EN,0,0,AAVE|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 07:51:38

A whale that received compensation during the Genesis Trading last year in August 2024, sold a staggering 40,000 ETH in this market crash. Amid its strong underperformance, the market sentiment for the altcoin seems to be worsening further. Ethereum Whale Offloads 40,000 ETH Amid Market Uncertainty A major Ethereum whale, known for receiving the largest ETH compensation during the Genesis Trading liquidation in August 2024, has reportedly sold 40,000 ETH, worth a staggering $89.9 million through over-the-counter (OTC) trades in the past two days. This address had received a total of 114,500 ETH valued at $358.19 million during the liquidation process, as per data from Arkham Intelligence . However, it has now offloaded nearly 30% of its holdings in the last two days. This comes as the ETH price has been on a free fall , dropping more than 13% over the last week, raising concerns about price stability. Source: Arkham Intelligence Unrealized Profits Plunge to Bear Market Levels According to data from CryptoQuant, the unrealized profit ratio among Ethereum whales has dropped to levels not seen since the previous bear market. The ETH/BTC ratio has been on a continuous downtrend amid the growing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. Despite Ethereum’s price being roughly twice as high as it was during the bear market, many whale positions are now yielding the same profit levels as before. Notably, the whale cohort holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH has reverted to a negative unrealized profit ratio. This shows a concerning situation as analysts warn of heightened volatility ahead for ETH. Source: CryptoQuant On the other hand, the ETH exchange deposits have also been on the rise. On-chain data shows that over the last two weeks, investors have moved more than 60,000 ETH to exchanges, suggesting heightened selling pressure. ETH Price Repeats Historical Patterns From 2019 Prominent crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has drawn parallels between current ETH price action and its performance during the previous Federal Reserve monetary tightening cycle. According to Cowen, Ethereum is repeating its 2019 behavior during the Fed’s quantitative tightening (QT) phase. The analyst noted that in 2019, ETH formed a wedge pattern under QT conditions, and remained in the same structure for almost a year. A brief breakout above the wedge preceded a sharp decline below it. Interestingly, it also coincided with the Fed’s QT policy shortly afterward. This marked a bottom for the ETH/BTC pair, followed by a rally in ETH/USD, though the price later dipped deeper into its regression band. Source: Benjamin Cowen Cowen notes that this cycle appears to be unfolding similarly, with the main difference being the extended duration of QT in the current cycle. Presently, the ETH price has broken down from its wedge pattern into its regression band. The analyst suggests there are “decent odds” that the Fed could end QT within the next few months. As of press time, ETH price is trading 5.46% up at $2,191 with daily trading volumes down 16.73%. Moreover, the ETH open interest is up 2.62% to $19.23 billion.

The biggest upgrade to Ethereum since 2024, Pectra consists of 11 major features , or ""Ethereum improvement proposals"" (EIPs), that will be shipped all at once. Together, the features aim to enhance staking, wallet functionality, and overall network efficiency. Sepolia's Pectra upgrade, which was completed at 07:29:36 UTC , followed a failed test on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet last week. A misconfiguration among validators resulted in a chain split , rendering Holesky temporarily unusable . Testnets mimic a main blockchain and are used by developers to test code changes in a low-stakes environment. Holesky, which has a validator structure closer to Ethereum’s mainnet than Sepolia, was seen as a critical proving ground for Pectra. (Developers are still working to get Holesky back into operation and have set up an alternative developer network as a temporary testing ground for validators .) Ethereum developers are set to meet on Mar. 6 to discuss Pectra's mainnet release timeline. With only one fully successful test, developers may opt to delay the mainnet deployment to ensure stability. One key Pectra proposal that will benefit Ethereum validators is EIP-7251, which increases the maximum amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. The change is meant to address today's clunky staking system, where validators who stake more than their 32 ETH must split their stake across multiple nodes. Another highly-anticipated proposal, EIP-7702, would let crypto wallets temporarily function as smart contracts. The change moves Ethereum closer to account abstraction, enabling wallets to offer more user-friendly features. For example, users could pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of ETH, set up automatic payments for subscriptions, or recover access to their wallets without relying on complex seed phrases. Pectra's rocky test cycle comes as Ethereum's developers are under pressure to ship upgrades more quickly. Some Ethereum fans fear the network is losing its edge to newer chains like Solana, which has gained mindshare in recent months due to its popularity among meme coin users. The price of ETH has also recently underperformed relative to other major coins, and the Ethereum Foundation—the non-profit steward of the network's development—has been beset by leadership drama.

Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoins-75500-analyst-historical-magnet-level/,"An analyst has pointed out how the 50-week moving average (MA) of Bitcoin has historically acted as a sort of magnet for the asset’s price. 50-Week MA Is Currently Situated At $75,500 For Bitcoin In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about the 50-week MA of Bitcoin. An “MA” is a technical analysis indicator that calculates the average value of any asset’s price over a given period of time and as its name suggests, moves in time, updating its value according to the changes in the price itself. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Crashes 15% After Massive Profit-Taking Spike MAs can be useful tools for studying long-term trends in an asset, as they smooth out the price curve to remove any local deviations. An MA can be taken over any window of time, but there are some particularly popular choices like the 200-day. In the context of the current topic, the time-range of focus is the 50-week. Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in this MA for Bitcoin over the past decade or so: As is visible in the above graph, Bitcoin has been approaching this line following the latest market downturn. The asset has previously shown several retests of this level over the years. “The 50-week moving average has historically acted as a magnet for Bitcoin $BTC during trend shifts,” explains Martinez. So far in the current cycle, the line has acted as support for the cryptocurrency, helping prevent the bull run from running out of steam. At present, the 50-week MA is situated at $75,500. Given the current trajectory of the asset, it’s possible that a retest of the level may end up taking place once more. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the level would again provide support to Bitcoin, or if it would usher in the bear market. In some other news, sentiment among the US investors has plummeted recently, as CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has revealed in an X post. In the chart, the data of the “Coinbase Premium Index” is displayed. This metric measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The former platform is mainly used by American investors, while the latter serves a global traffic, so the indicator’s value essentially tells us about how the behavior differs between the two demographics. During the rally earlier, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index spiked to a sharp positive level, suggesting the US-based whales were buying. Shortly after, though, it dipped back into the negative and has since plunged deeper into the zone, implying users on the exchange are doing some heavy distribution.

In a new interview with CNBC, Lee says that Bitcoin may increase more than 70% from its current value in 2025 as the top digital asset by market cap continues to see increasing adoption among investors. He also says that Bitcoin’s recent correction was expected by some experts and that BTC may suddenly surge. “I would say what’s interesting is Bitcoin’s not had negative headlines in February, but it was down. But I know our technician, Mark Newton, had talked about this being a cyclical downturn in Bitcoin through the end of March. So he was talking mid-January getting down to $62,000… As you know, Bitcoin makes all of its gains in 10 days, so if people sort of try to time this they’re going to miss out on a chance for Bitcoin to go back to its highs.” Lastly, Lee says that Bitcoin may see massive adoption this year with the possibility of capital markets firm Citadel Securities entering the crypto sector. “I think it’s going to do better than $150,000 this year… because it’s becoming more widely held. You know if Citadel starts trading it, it starts to have more broad acceptance.” Bitcoin is trading for $87,897 at time of writing, up 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

The company also announced that it is eying global markets to expand its offerings. Metaplanet Sees Strong Year-to-Date BTC Yield of 45.1% Additionally, the company’s CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that Metaplanet has achieved a year-to-date BTC yield of 45%. This performance is well above the firm’s pre-defined target of achieving 35% BTC yield for every quarter of 2025. In February, Metaplanet noted that it achieved a 23.2% BTC yield year-to-date and targets a 35% yield by this year. The “Japanese MicroStrategy” has already announced its ambitious plan of accumulating 21,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2026. Last week, the Japanese investment firm announced the issuance of $13.6 million in Zero-Interest bonds to fund additional Bitcoin investment. Bitcoin Price Dip Favors Whales Following Metaplanet’s recent Bitcoin accumulations, the company’s stock rallied, rising above 19%, all the way to ¥4045 at press time . In February, the stock price increased to an all-time high around ¥6,500 levels, however, slumped nearly 50% of its gains in a few weeks, amid Bitcoin price corrections. Further, the fresh BTC purchase comes amid the crypto’s extreme volatility and lack of sustained momentum. Hopes of a scaling down in U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs have aided risk appetite. Having initially tumbled below $80,000 last week, Bitcoin rebounded following Trump’s announcement of five cryptos , including Bitcoin, for crypto reserve. However, this recovery was short-lived with the price dropping to $83,000 on Monday. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the slump could be the time to “start setting cash aside and get ready for a potential buy-the-dip opportunity.” #Bitcoin $BTC Sharpe Ratio typically resets to ""Low Risk"" after hitting ""High Risk.""

As the crypto market awaits to see whether Congress will support Trump’s plan, speculation is rife about which other altcoins will be included. The upcoming White House Crypto Summit has offered some clues, with its list of invitees hinting at potential additions to the reserve. Top Altcoins that Trump Could Add to the Crypto Strategic Reserve According to CryptoRank, Trump meme coins are not likely to be part of the reserve. Instead, US altcoins with strong fundamentals like Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Polkadot (DOT), and Hedera (HBAR) are likely to be picked. Chainlink (LINK) Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret has confirmed that Chainlink founder Sergey Nazarov will attend the White House crypto summit. This could see Trump recognize LINK in future crypto announcements. Moreover, last week, Nazarov met with Congressman Tom Emmer and the Executive Director of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, Bo Hines. This stirred s peculation of LINK being added to the reserve. Chainlink is also one of the top altcoins to buy after a 6% gain in 24 hours to trade at $14.94. Chainlink’s CMF is also tipping north suggesting a rise in buying pressure. As interest continues, and Chainlink price flips resistance at $22, it could stir a rally to the 178.6% Fibonacci level. LINK/USDT: 1-day Chart Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin is also one of the altcoins likely to be included in the US crypto reserve due to its similarities to Bitcoin. Moreover, Litecoin has a pending ETF application with the SEC. As Bloomberg analysts stated, Litecoin is likely to become the second altcoin ETF in the US. This is because the SEC has never considered Litecoin to be a security. This regulatory clarity also makes it an ideal pick for the reserve. Litecoin price today trades at $102 after a 2% drop in 24 hours amid bearish trends in the broader market. Despite the price drop, the Litecoin network has seen rapid growth after the hash rate tripled in the last 12 months. This shows miner confidence and supports a bullish Litecoin price prediction . Litecoin Hash Rate Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is also one of the best altcoins to buy as it is likely to get picked for a crypto reserve. As Coingape reported, 21Shares has filed for a spot DOT ETF with the SEC. Nasdaq also recently submitted a 19b-4 filing for the ETF. Polkadot founder Gavin Wood has not confirmed whether he has been invited to the White House. If Wood attends this summit it will increase DOT’s chance of being picked to be part of the reserve. At press time, sellers continued to weigh on Polkadot price with RSI dropping to 41. However, DOT was in a demand zone. which could spark buying activity and a rally to resistance at $5.20. DOT/USDT: 1-day Chart Hedera (HBAR) Hedera can also be one of the altcoins included in the reserve. HBAR is also the best crypto to buy as it has gained much attention since Grayscale filed for a spot HBAR ETF with the SEC. If approved, the ETF could strengthen HBAR’s regulatory standing. Hedera price has registered massive gains this week despite bearish trends across the broader crypto market. At press time, HBAR trades at $0.25 after a 26% gain in seven days. The altcoin’s RSI is rising and the AO bars have flipped green showing a bullish Hedera price forecast . This could see Hedera price rise to flip resistance at $0.26. HBAR/USD: 1-day Chart Summary of Top 4 Altcoins That Trumo Could Add to a US Crypto Reserve Chainlink, Litecoin, Poldatot, and Hedera are likely to be the next altcoins to be included in a US crypto reserve. These coins have some strong fundamentals and positive regulatory standing that make them ideal candidates.

Negative sentiment around Trump is rising, with concerns that his policies—like tariffs and a proposed U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve—could manipulate markets. Investors worry that tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China may fuel volatility across crypto and stocks. Meanwhile, debates surge over the legitimacy of a U.S. crypto reserve, with skepticism about which assets—Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, or Cardano—should be included. Market fluctuations continue, as uncertainty around these developments keeps traders on edge. Hence, the crypto market remains in a state of uncertainty as Bitcoin struggles to maintain its footing, dropping below $91K again and now hovering around $85 K. While institutional adoption and regulatory advancements continue, short-term price action remains shaky, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen. https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1897135059066609724 Altcoins Take a Beating, AI Tokens Suffer Worst Losses Most Layer 1 projects have suffered double-digit losses YTD, with XRP (+5.3%) being the sole exception. BTC (-7.87%), TON (-7.94%), and TIA (-9.55%) have all faced declines. Layer 2 (L2) solutions and AI tokens have been hit hardest, with L2s down over 40% year-to-date and some AI-focused tokens plunging nearly 90% from their highs. The only exceptions in this downturn are Maker (MKR), which has gained 10%, and XRP, which is up 5%. Ethereum’s on-chain activity has slowed significantly, with median gas fees dropping to 1 GWEI, the lowest in over a year. While Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks like Base remain active, overall market participation appears to be dwindling. DeFi tokens also struggled, except for MKR (+10.85%), which has benefited from USDS adoption. Other DeFi projects, such as ENA and AERO, have been among the biggest losers, down over 50% YTD. What’s Next? Market sentiment is split—some see the current price action as a bearish retest, while others believe a recovery is underway. BTC’s re-entry into its previous range suggests the latter is more likely. Many tokens have retraced gains from the election-driven rally and may take time to recover. With weak price action across major sectors, Nansen’s analysts remain neutral to bearish in the short term but optimistic in the long run. Many traders are focusing on stablecoin yield farming rather than chasing altcoin pumps, waiting for a clearer trend reversal before making major moves. For now, Bitcoin is back in its previous range, and sentiment remains mixed.

This price jump coincides with a major milestone as the project surpasses 4 million followers on X. With increasing adoption, community engagement, and speculation about a potential Binance and Coinbase listing, can Pi Coin price reach the $100 mark? Pi Network Hits Major Milestone: Here’s All Pi Network’s recent milestone highlights its expanding community and growing influence. The official X account celebrated the achievement , stating that the network now has over 4 million followers. This massive following reflects strong investor confidence and sustained interest in the project. Source: Pi Network, X Meanwhile, adding to the bullish sentiment, Pi Coin secured the 11th spot among top cryptocurrencies by market cap outpacing Hedera. A crypto analyst known as ‘The Times of PiNetwork’ pointed out that Pi Coin has achieved this rank without being listed on leading crypto exchanges. Notably, the post emphasized that a Binance or Coinbase listing could trigger a price rally, potentially pushing Pi Coin price towards the $100 milestone. But why do these Binance and Coinbase listings matter? How Binance & Coinbase Listings Impact? A listing on the leading crypto exchanges could be a game-changer for Pi Network. Analysts believe that such a move would significantly increase Pi Coin’s liquidity and accessibility, driving a surge in demand. Increased Trading Volume: Being listed on Binance or Coinbase would expose Pi Coin to a wider audience, leading to higher trading activity. More users would have the opportunity to buy and sell Pi, creating upward price momentum. Global Recognition: The listing would boost Pi Coin’s credibility, attracting institutional investors and further strengthening its market position. Expanded User Base: Many crypto traders and enthusiasts who were previously unable to access Pi Coin could start investing, increasing adoption and market participation. Pi Network Ecosystem & Real-World Utility Beyond exchange listings, Pi Network’s real strength lies in its ecosystem. The network is developing utility-based applications that could revolutionize its use cases. Crypto trader Eniwealth ICT DON highlighted key upcoming events that could impact Pi Coin’s price. He noted that Pi Network’s transition to an open network phase is driving innovation. Projects like Pailot Services are emerging, allowing users to spend Pi on real-world transactions. Additionally, the recent reduction in Pi’s mining rate by 38.1% is making mining less rewarding. This shift could encourage holders to spend and trade their tokens within the network, further increasing demand. Simultaneously, the community members are anticipating further positive announcements ahead. For context, the Pi community eagerly awaits some major announcements during Pi Day (March 14, 2025), which can further boost the crypto’s appeal to investors. Besides, the community’s anticipation of the potential addition of Pi Coin to the US Strategic Reserve list has further boosted sentiment. Binance’s Cryptic Messages Spark Speculation Adding to the hype, Binance has posted cryptic messages on X that appear to reference Pi Coin. The ‘Binance Intern’ account shared a post reading, “If you’re reading this, you’re a real one,” followed by the Pi symbol (as shown below). Another post asked, “If your favorite project was a dessert, what would it be?” with a slice of pie emoji. Source: Binance Intern, X While these posts may be playful, they have fueled speculation that Binance is testing community engagement before a potential listing. The Pi listing on Binance, if happens, could set the stage for a price breakout. Can Pi Coin Reach $100? Pi price was up nearly 8% today and exchanged hands at $1.90, while its trading volume stayed near the flatline at $814 million. The crypto has added 4% gains in the weekly chart but recorded a significant decline from its ATH of around $3 recorded last week. However, with a growing community, increasing real-world utility, and potential exchange listings on the horizon, Pi Network is positioned for a significant price movement. While $100 may seem ambitious, market momentum and strategic developments could push Pi Coin toward this milestone.

Some analysts suggested the second-largest crypto risks a 40% correction as its price attempts to hold its support level “between heaven and hell.” Related Reading: Cardano 125% Pump Coming? Analyst Says ADA ‘Could Be Poised’ For Rally To $2.20 Monday Dump Sends Ethereum To 15-Month Low Ethereum has fallen to a yearly low of $1,993, according to Binance market data. The cryptocurrency has dropped below $2,000 for the first time in 15 months, hitting its lowest price since late November 2023. Amid the February market retraces, ETH failed to hold the $3,000 level, hovering between the $2,500 and $2,8’00 price range for most of the month, despite the February 3 market crash to $2,100. However, the end-of-month correction saw Ethereum bleed 17% to a new low of $2,076. Per Coinglass Data, the King of Altcoins closed last month with a 31.95% decline, registering its first February Close with red numbers since 2018. ETH recovered 17% on Sunday, attempting to reclaim the $2,500 resistance level after US President Donald Trump announced the establishment of a “Crypto Strategic Reserve,” which will have Bitcoin and Ethereum “at the heart” of it. On Monday, ETH fell below the $2,000 mark during the market’s dump and risks dropping another 40%. Ali Martinez highlighted that Ethereum could fall as low as $1,250 if it doesn’t reclaim some key levels. The analyst noted that Ethereum has been consolidating in a parallel channel since 2024, bouncing from the channel’s upper boundary to the middle or lower boundary before bouncing back to the upper zone. Nonetheless, ETH broke below the channel’s lower boundary after dipping below $2,200 last week. If the cryptocurrency doesn’t reclaim the channel’s lower boundary, its price could retrace to the $1,600 or even $1,250 support zones. Martinez noted that Ethereum’s most critical resistance barrier is at the $2,400 mark, where over 2.41 million investors bought 62,68 million ETH. To the analyst, a breakout above this level could “clear the path for a rally toward $3,000.” ETH Following Bear Market Years’ Playbook? As Ethereum retested the barrier “between heaven and hell,” some market watchers pointed out that ETH’s recent performance resembles its 2018 and 2022 price action. According to the pseudonym trader 5.0 Inverted, the king of altcoins is “following 2018 and 2022 bear market price action.” The chart shows that ETH steadily declined throughout those years, retracing 82,71% and 68.29% in 2018 and 2022, respectively. Related Reading: Polkadot Price Crisis: Further Losses Incoming After DOT Falls Under $4.8 The cryptocurrency saw small price rallies in the first six months of both years but continued the downtrend. ETH has declined 36.4% year-to-date (YTD), showing a similar performance to the mentioned years. Another trader suggested that Ethereum dropped 60% from $4,200 to $1,800 last cycle before pumping 170% to its $4,800 all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Based on 2021’s playbook, the cryptocurrency might continue its negative performance before recovering at the end of the year. At the time of writing, ETH has recovered nearly 7% from its drop below $2,000 and trades at $2,135.

Stellar (XLM), TRUMP, and FXGuys ($FXG) are all over the headlines for their explosive growth potential. However, experts have highlighted $FXG as the token to outperform both XLM and TRUMP and turn $100 into $10,000 before the year ends. XLM and TRUMP investors are now accumulating the $FXG token, which is hailed as the best crypto to invest in for greater market returns. Read on as we explore why $FXG is the best investment option that experts believe can help you turn $100 Into $10,000 in 2025! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Stellar Market Activities Triggers XLM Price Volatility According to CoinMarketCap , Stellar's market capitalization has dropped from $11.82 billion to $9.76 billion in just over a month. This indicates waning interest in the Stellar token, which has made XLM's price increasingly volatile in recent weeks. For context, XLM dipped by 23.81% from $0.42 to $0.32 just eight days into February 2025, and XLM's price dipped further by 21.88% to $0.25 on February 28. Interestingly, this XLM price recovered into March, rising by 32% to $0.33 by March 3. Experts now believe that XLM's price could continue to rise and hit $0.50 in the following months, but Stellar's recent volatility has already made investors diversify their portfolios. These investors are diverting funds into the $FXG presale to secure higher profit margins. Many Stellar investors are accumulating $FXG, which experts say has the best chance of turning $100 into $10,000 in the next bull cycle, making it the best crypto to invest in now. TRUMP’s Open Interest Declines: Is it the Best Crypto Coin to Buy Now? Another token struggling in the bear market is the TRUMP coin. Data on Coinglass show that TRUMP's Futures Open Interest (USD) dramatically dropped from $1.14 billion to $386.53 million in 2025. This suggests reduced trader activity for the TRUMP coin, which has made the token's price volatile in recent weeks. The OFFICIAL TRUMP coin dipped by 37.75% from $24.95 to $15.53 just twelve days into February 2025, and TRUMP's price dipped further by 13.19% to $13.48 on February 28. Interestingly, this TRUMP price recovered into March, rising by 11.49% to $15.03 by March 3. Due to the recent price recovery, optimistic experts predict that the TRUMP coin's price could rise to $20 in the next few months. But TRUMP holders believe that another TRUMP rally might take some time to realize. That’s why they are now exploring their best chance of turning $100 into $10,000 with the $FXG token. However, while Stellar and the TRUMP coin have shown the potential to rebound, investors seeking the best crypto coin to buy now are accumulating the $FXG token to secure massive profits in the ongoing market.

However, the fight-back looks to have begun, and bulls are pushing to retake lost ground. S&P 500 falls out of ascending channel Source: TradingView The S&P 500 has taken quite a blow from the ongoing tariff wars. The ascending channel, in place since early 2023, is in danger of failing. The price has dropped out of the channel and has tagged the 200 SMA. The only other times the price dropped out of the channel was in October 2023 due to concerns over government funding and higher interest rates, and then in August 2024 for the Japanese stock market crash. U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) continues to fall Source: TradingView Very good news is that the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is falling. As can be seen in the chart above, the DXY rejected from the major descending trendline. This all corresponds with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement that the Trump administration wants a weaker dollar, which is likely to have the effect of lifting risk assets higher. $BTC makes a short-term higher low Source: TradingView Looking at the short-term chart for $BTC, the main takeaway is that the price is still rolling over. A series of lower highs has yet to be challenged. That said, a recent higher low has just been set. It now remains to be seen whether the price gets rejected from the bottom of the wedge, or if the bulls can push the price back above. $95,200 is where the bulls would make a higher high, while the top of the wedge and a potential breakout would also be around this level. If the price is rejected from the bottom of the wedge, or even from the major ascending trendline, the bulls would need to avoid a lower low in the next correction, which if made, could take $BTC all the way down to $73,000. Bottom signalled on daily RSI? Source: TradingView Zooming out into the daily time frame some interesting developments can be seen. At the bottom of the chart, first the Stochastic RSI, shows that the indicator lines broke up beyond the descending trendline. This makes a higher high, and if the indicator lines can bounce from the trendline, this sends momentum back under the price, pushing it higher. At the very bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index shows an unbroken trendline from November 2024. It can be seen that the indicator line came as low as 24.20. This is the lowest point reached on the daily since August 2023, and therefore might well signal a bottom. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to prosecutors, Au submitted a false tax return after benefiting from Iza’s illegal schemes. Iza, who pleaded guilty in January, ran multiple fraud operations between 2020 and 2024, including selling access to fraudulently obtained Meta and Facebook advertising accounts. The Justice Department stated that these schemes generated millions in unreported income. Authorities: Iza’s Ex-Girlfriend Aided in Laundering Funds Through Shell Companies Authorities allege that, under Iza’s direction, Au helped launder illicit funds by creating shell companies and opening bank accounts in their names. She then used the proceeds to finance luxury expenses, including high-end real estate, vehicles, jewelry, and designer clothing. Prosecutors also revealed that approximately $1 million of these funds were used to bribe Los Angeles deputies. In addition to personal expenditures, the couple allegedly spent nearly $10 million on entertainment and acquired around $16 million in cryptocurrency. Iza, who also founded the Zort crypto trading platform, admitted to charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, and tax evasion.

He allegedly used this data to blackmail a victim into handing over a laptop with crypto. … pic.twitter.com/IoZKDXIiny — Ricards (@Ricardswo) September 27, 2024 He also confessed to bribing Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department deputies for security services and to obtain search warrants targeting his financial and personal adversaries. As part of her plea agreement, Au admitted to transferring over $2.6 million into her personal bank accounts between 2020 and 2023. She faces up to three years in prison, while Iza, set for sentencing on June 16, could receive a maximum of 35 years. Iza Accused of Using Stolen Data to Coerce Victim Into Surrendering Crypto-Laden Laptop Iza is accused of using the illicitly obtained information to intimidate and coerce a person identified only as E.Z. into surrendering a laptop containing valuable cryptocurrency assets. The accusations against Iza date back to November 2021, when a report by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department detailed a disturbing encounter between Iza and E.Z. The two had known each other for two years and were previously involved in a crypto business together. According to the report, while driving together, Iza requested to stop for food. As they were standing by the car afterward, an SUV pulled up, and two men exited. One of the men, armed with a handgun, instructed E.Z. to “get in the car.” E.Z. managed to escape and called the police, fearing that Iza was attempting to kidnap him to obtain access to his crypto assets. When questioned by a responding officer, Iza claimed that E.Z. had agreed to give him $300,000 for some cryptocurrency.

Article",https://coinpaprika.com/news/german-summary-of-blackrock-s-why-bitcoin-article,"BlackRock's article ""Why Bitcoin? A Perspective from Model Portfolio Builders"" explores Bitcoin's growing role as an investable asset and its potential benefits for portfolio diversification. The article highlights Bitcoin’s evolving investment thesis , including its role as a store of value, hedge against fiat instability, and a tool for digital asset adoption. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin Has Long-Term Investment Merit: BlackRock sees Bitcoin as an asset with diversification potential, particularly in an era of geopolitical instability and rising government deficits. Institutional Adoption is Growing: The launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) in 2024 was a pivotal moment, unlocking access for traditional investors and improving market liquidity. Regulatory Climate Matters: A more Bitcoin -friendly U.S. administration could accelerate innovation and infrastructure development. Bitcoin's Volatility May Decline Over Time: Increased participation from institutional investors could lead to better price discovery and lower volatility. Scarcity as a Value Proposition: Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins (with a significant portion permanently lost) enhances its scarcity-driven value. Most Important Quotes from the Article On Bitcoin’s Investment Value: “As multi-asset portfolio constructors, we believe bitcoin has long-term investment merit for certain investors and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” On Market Maturity and Stability: “A general maxim of financial markets is increased levels of investor participation can lead to improvements in price discovery and liquidity – and as a consequence – create more price stability.” On Bitcoin’s Scarcity: “Unlike gold, to which bitcoin is often compared, there’s no ability to meet excess demand with increased supply.” On Bitcoin’s Global Role: “Bitcoin is a digitally native, bearer asset, equipped with cleverly embedded mechanics to communicate value across the internet in a way that is bankless, borderless, permissionless, cost-efficient, fast, and indiscriminate.” On Critics' View of Bitcoin’s Value: “Critics’ go-to refrain is bitcoin has no intrinsic value. To the contrary, in our view, the discussed embedded characteristics represent fundamentally real and attractive sources of intrinsic value.” Conclusion BlackRock presents Bitcoin as a serious contender for portfolio inclusion , citing its scarcity, resilience, and digital-first attributes as key drivers of value. While acknowledging risks like volatility, they argue that institutional adoption and financial innovation will continue to push Bitcoin into mainstream investment strategies.

The U.S. president, Donald Trump, has tried to live up to his words on cryptocurrency during his presidential campaigns, which makes the crypto industry hopeful. Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs, has stated that the U.S. needs to show the world that it is open to cryptocurrency business. To him, the summit should result in tax incentives for builders, regulatory clarity for projects, and paths to compliance that don’t involve multi-year legal battles with regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been accused of unfairness toward crypto in the past, with several entities and individual crypto players taken to court and even jailed. Industry leaders believe the summit may result in legal clarity to foster domestic business growth and job creation. “Regulatory clarity is the biggest lever the U.S. can pull to retain top-tier blockchain talent,” said Sid Powell, CEO of the blockchain institutional capital marketplace Maple. “A pragmatic approach would recognize that well-structured regulatory frameworks enhance, rather than hinder, innovation.” Saga CEO Rebecca Liao, the campaign advisor on technology for the Clinton and Biden presidential campaigns, echoed the sentiments. Rebecca believes a clear regulatory action will open the U.S. market for more crypto players. Congress and industry leaders to shape U.S. crypto policy at exclusive summit Rebecca further noted that Congress has a big role in leveling the crypto policy landscape. She said the crypto policy wins that have worked for the country are not directly associated with the president. According to Les Borsai, co-founder of Wave Digital Assets and advisor to state and federal governments on crypto, the blockchain space must use a two-year period, with Congress’ support, to develop legislation that will serve the industry several years ahead. The planned crypto summit will take place this Friday at the State House, and it will be an exclusive affair for the industry’s top leaders. Among the expected attendees include Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, Exodus CEO JP Richardson, and Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi. President Donald Trump speaking with attendees at an Arizona for Trump rally at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona. Taken on August 23, 2024 by Gage Skidmore. Some experts have hinted that Trump’s announcement to establish a crypto reserve will set the agenda for the day. Syscoin Foundation President Jagdeep Sidhu believes the issue around the crypto reserve will be a top priority during the meeting. His sentiments are informed by the recent announcement that the U.S. crypto reserve will include other altcoins, not only Bitcoin, as most expected. Something that didn’t go well with Bitcoin lovers. The Syscoin President has stated that the administration may need to defend their pronouncement on Friday as many industry leaders are not for the diverse asset class. They have openly questioned the decision to include altcoins like XRP, ADA, and SOL. Autonomy’s CEO, Todd Ruof, noted that stablecoin oversight is also an important area of focus. High-level engagement may push the US to adopt something from the international approach. According to him, some recent developments, like Hong Kong’s licensing system and the European Union’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) rules, have provided a lot of clarity on crypto. The chances of U.S. lawmakers pushing for more clarity on reserve requirements are extremely high. Globally, strong standards have been established, and domestically, there is a commitment to ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and well-defined reserve policies. White House AI and crypto czar will chair the summit According to trusted reports, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks will guide the summit. But there’s no assurance that artificial intelligence will be discussed. Ruoff maintains that the choice of David Sacks as chairman does make a difference. If crypto takes off as a fundamental driver of financial innovation, he will have to ensure that any oversight his committee provides is a coordination of risk and reward, one that keeps consumer protection intact without stifling change.

(Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch). Sacks may also include the AI agenda, although there is no guarantee of this. When it comes to things such as fraud detection, compliance automation, and risk management, AI may get mentioned. There’s also the big-picture question of how AI-led financial systems coexist with decentralized finance. Currently, the prevailing belief is that crypto will go further and that it can change the future of the United States. The Trump administration might correct all the wrong impulses of previous years as it gives digital assets a favorable thumbs-up. The White House crypto summit aims for a solution that encourages responsible growth of cryptocurrency, not just on a whim. Baseless bureaucracy can potentially suffocate the industry, but things like client protection, risk exposure, transparency, and custody safeguards must happen.

Upbit has just listed Kaito ( KAITO ) on its KRW, BTC, and USDT markets, with deposits only available through Base—other networks are not supported. Buoyed by the listing, KAITO is up 25% in the past 24 hours, trading at $1.82 at press time, with 24-hour trading volume of $996 million, up by 108%. Though the Upbit listing is a significant milestone for Kaito, it’s not the first major exchange to list the token. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Gate.io, Bybit , and MEXC all listed KAITO on Feb. 20, coinciding with the token’s generation event and the start of its airdrop campaign. You might also like: KAITO surges over 100% after exchange listings, but correction looms Speaking of airdrop, the top 12 aidrop claimants received a combined total of approximately $3.3 million worth of KAITO, but 10 of them have already offloaded most of their holdings, with 8 completely exiting their positions right after the airdrop . As of now, 15.7% of airdrop clamants are still holding onto their KAITO tokens, while 83.4% have either sold or transferred most of theirs, according to Dune Analytics . A small number of addresses have accumulated more tokens. This suggests that the majority of Kaito’s airdrop claimants have chosen to liquidate their tokens rather than hold onto them for long-term profits. Source: Dune Analytics As far as Kaito’s recent price performance is concerned, after the late Feb. rally that propelled KAITO to its all-time high on Feb. 27, Kaito experienced a sharp correction, retracing much of its gains. By early March, Kaito had dropped to around $1.50, marking a significant pullback from its peak. At press time, Kaito is trading slightly below the 21 EMA ($1.86), acting as its dynamic resistance. A breakout above this level could signal a potential reversal, while failure to hold could lead to further declines towards the local support level of $1.50. However, the recent spike in volume, likely the result of the Upbit listing, indicates strong buying pressure with key resistance lying around the $2.00-$2.10 range. Moreover, since 10 of the aidrop top claimants have already taken profits, KAITO’s price now stands on a more stable foundation, which could allow it to consolidate at a more sustainable level, especially if traders continue to show interest in the token.

The SEC dropped cases against prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, as well as other big names in crypto, including Gemini and ConsenSys. . While the SEC’s new approach aims to support innovation in the crypto space, some worry it could reduce oversight and lead to unchecked risks. When asked if the SEC could reopen investigations into dismissed cases, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel explained that cases already dismissed “with prejudice” cannot be re-filed. For investigations that haven’t yet become lawsuits, they could potentially be reopened, but statute of limitations issues would make that unlikely. While the SEC could start new investigations based on future misconduct, Fagel noted that the current administration seems focused on giving crypto more freedom, meaning it could take some time before any new actions are taken, though some investors may face significant losses in the meantime. “But since the current administration seems intent on giving crypto a free pass–yes, a lot of investors will lose a massive amount of money–it’s gonna be awhile before that happens,” Fagel wrote. President Trump has shown strong support for cryptocurrency, aiming to make the U.S. a leader in digital assets. Early in his term, he signed an order to promote digital asset growth and created a group to propose new rules. His recent announcement hints at adding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano to a national reserve.

Between September 2024 and January 2025, coinciding with Trump’s re-election, the DXY index climbed from 100 to 110. This current cycle, the index peaked at 110 in mid-January but has since dropped below 105 for the first time since mid-November. If the DXY were to fall to around 103, it would erase all its gains since Trump's victory in November. Typically, a DXY index above 100 is considered strong, which tends to put pressure on risk assets. However, as the index dipped below 105, bitcoin (BTC) rose above $88,000. A similar pattern was observed in 2017 when the DXY fell from 103 to below 90, coinciding with bitcoin’s bull run that year, that saw it top out at $20,000 in December. Despite this, macroeconomic uncertainty persists, with concerns surrounding tariffs , inflation, and U.S. GDP growth. The economy appears to be slowing, and Friday’s jobs report is expected to show a continuation of 4.0% unemployment rate. If the report comes in weaker than anticipated, treasury yields could continue declining, increasing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve could consider a rate cut in its March meeting.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 09:40:56

But as 2025 approaches, many are questioning: Can SOL maintain its position among top cryptos, or will stronger competitors take over? While Solana offers steady growth, Dawgz AI is the real high-reward opportunity. This AI-powered meme coin combines automated trading rewards with viral meme potential, giving early investors a chance for massive gains. Solana’s best days may be behind it, but Dawgz AI is just getting started. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction for 2025 – Monthly Breakdown Analyzing Solana’s potential price movement month by month can help investors prepare for upcoming opportunities and risks. Q1 2025 (Jan - Mar): A Slow Start Before a Breakout? Solana enters 2025 with mixed expectations as investors anticipate whether the crypto market will kick off with a bullish or bearish trend. Historically, January and February can be slow months for altcoins, but a Bitcoin surge could help SOL gain momentum. March may be the first major test, with investors watching closely for potential breakouts. March 2025 Forecast: Min Price: $134.14 Avg Price: $143.98 Max Price: $151.41 Potential ROI: 4.99% Q2 2025 (Apr - Jun): A Stronger Uptrend As the second quarter begins, altcoin sentiment usually improves, and Solana could benefit from a broader market recovery. If institutional interest continues growing and NFT activity on Solana’s blockchain expands, this period could see steady price appreciation. However, macro factors like interest rates and Bitcoin’s stability could still impact the trend. June 2025 Forecast: Min Price: $128.14 Avg Price: $136.18 Max Price: $145.80 Potential ROI: 1.10% Q3 2025 (Jul - Sep): Altcoin Season Kicks In? Historically, Q3 is one of the strongest periods for altcoins, with many projects seeing major price gains. Solana, often labeled the Ethereum killer, could see renewed demand from DeFi, NFTs, and institutional investors. If the market enters a full-blown bull run, SOL could test new highs during this quarter. September 2025 Forecast: Min Price: $234.98 Avg Price: $276.38 Max Price: $314.76 Potential ROI: 118.27% Q4 2025 (Oct - Dec): Can Solana End the Year Strong? The final quarter of the year is often Bitcoin’s best, and if BTC experiences a parabolic rise, Solana could follow. However, this quarter also brings profit-taking risks as investors lock in gains before the New Year. If institutional adoption continues, SOL could end 2025 above $200, but a major breakout above $1,000 would require unprecedented demand. December 2025 Forecast: Min Price: $182.04 Avg Price: $204.96 Max Price: $231.56 Potential ROI: 60.57% Solana 2025 Price Prediction Table Month Min. Price Avg. Price Max. Price Potential ROI Mar 2025 $134.14 $143.98 $151.41 4.99% Apr 2025 $130.66 $138.57 $146.31 1.45% May 2025 $130.23 $135.48 $141.48 1.90% Jun 2025 $128.14 $136.18 $145.80 1.10% Jul 2025 $150.88 $202.50 $267.66 85.60% Aug 2025 $219.54 $232.60 $248.59 72.38% Sep 2025 $234.98 $276.38 $314.76 118.27% Oct 2025 $249.22 $280.07 $304.68 111.27% Nov 2025 $223.81 $250.73 $273.40 89.58% Dec 2025 $182.04 $204.96 $231.56 60.57% Which Crypto Coin Will Boom? The next crypto boom could come from AI-powered tokens, meme coins, or strong blockchain projects. Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) remain solid choices, but newcomers like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), an AI-driven meme coin in presale, might offer bigger returns. What is the Strongest Meme Coin? Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) dominate, but Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is gaining traction. It blends AI trading with meme coin energy, making it a strong contender for the next big breakout. Solana vs. Dawgz AI: Which One Has the Bigger Upside? Solana is a well-established blockchain with fast transactions and low fees, making it a strong player in the crypto space. But while SOL has already made its mark, the biggest gains come from getting in early - and that’s where Dawgz AI comes in. Dawgz AI isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an AI-powered crypto revolution that combines high-frequency trading algorithms with the hype and massive returns of meme coins. Early adopters are already jumping in, securing AI-powered rewards before it hits major exchanges. Why Dawgz AI Could Outperform Solana in 2025 and Beyond Bigger growth potential – Solana has seen massive gains, but it’s already a top-ranked coin. Dawgz AI is still in its presale phase, meaning it has room for explosive price action. AI and meme coin hype – Unlike SOL, Dawgz AI taps into the two hottest trends: artificial intelligence and meme coins. Early investors in meme coins like DOGE and SHIB saw 100x gains, and Dawgz AI could be next. Passive income through AI trading – Solana offers speed, but Dawgz AI offers profit automation. Staking $DAGZ gives users access to AI-powered trading bots that generate returns without active trading. Early entry means higher ROI – Solana’s biggest gains are behind it. Dawgz AI is still at a presale price, giving early adopters the chance to buy low and ride the wave up. Final Words Solana is a great blockchain, but if you’re looking for maximum returns, Dawgz AI has the edge. While many investors focus on Solana price prediction, the real opportunity lies in catching a project before it takes off. Dawgz AI is an AI-powered, meme-driven token in its early growth phase, and history shows that getting in early on a strong meme coin can be life-changing. The Dawgz Army is growing fast, and with AI-powered rewards and meme coin hype, $DAGZ could be the next major breakout. Don't miss your chance – get in before the price jumps. While Solana crypto price prediction suggests steady growth, Dawgz AI offers the kind of explosive potential that early investors dream of.

South Korea’s recent Upbit crackdown was a warning shot—stricter KYC & AML rules are coming. South Korea is stepping up its efforts to crack down on crypto-related financial crimes by strengthening its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. With cryptocurrency scams and frauds on the rise, authorities are now focusing on tougher policies to prevent illicit activities and protect investors. South Korea to bolster AML system against new financial and crypto crimes The South Korean financial authority is set to strengthen its anti-money laundering (AML) system with the goal of thwarting novel financial crimes, including those involving cryptocurrencies, according to… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) March 5, 2025 Why South Korea Is Taking Action The country’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a key regulator under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), recently held a meeting to discuss stricter AML measures as per local media reports . The rise of crypto-related crimes, including money laundering through virtual accounts and fraudulent remittance schemes, has pushed authorities to act quickly. The meeting, led by FIU Head Park Kwang, brought together officials from 11 key financial institutions, including the Financial Supervisory Service and the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. Their main goal was to figure out how to make AML inspections more effective and share insights on potential threats. To tackle crypto is getting more important as South Korea has emerged as a key player in the crypto industry, attracting businesses from around the world. With nearly 30% of global crypto trades happening in the country and 4% of its population investing in digital assets, the need for strong regulations has become more crucial than ever. New Measures to Tackle Crypto Crimes One of the biggest takeaways from the meeting was the plan to establish a People’s Livelihood Crime AML Joint Response Team. This new task force will work with financial institutions to detect vulnerabilities in the crypto market and strengthen security measures. Authorities are also looking at revising AML inspection procedures to ensure that crypto platforms follow strict guidelines. This move aims to prevent bad actors from exploiting the system for illegal activities like fraud and money laundering. Tighter Crypto Regulations Amid Growing Scandals This regulatory push comes at a time when the crypto industry is facing increasing scrutiny. Recently, the $1.4 billion Bybit hack shocked the market, ranking among the largest crypto thefts ever recorded. Such incidents have raised concerns about security loopholes and the need for better oversight. Meanwhile, South Korea’s FIU is also dealing with legal battles, including an appeal by Upbit operator Dunamu against the regulator’s business suspension order. The ongoing dispute highlights the tension between the need for stricter regulations and the challenges faced by crypto exchanges . Part of a Global Trend South Korea’s latest crackdown on crypto crimes aligns with similar efforts worldwide. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working on regulatory frameworks to balance innovation with investor protection, while the European Union is also tightening its crypto laws.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified that meme coins are generally not considered securities, providing a clearer regulatory environment for investors. This move aims to delineate regulatory boundaries, emphasizing personal responsibility in investing. Simultaneously, the meme coin market has experienced both surges and corrections. In 2024, tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu saw significant gains, but 2025 has brought challenges, with some meme coins facing declines and controversies. Despite these fluctuations, innovative projects continue to emerge, offering unique narratives and investment opportunities. But Arctic Pablo Coin stands out with an immersive narrative that transforms investment into an adventurous journey. Arctic Pablo Coin: Embark on a Mystical Journey with High ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an invitation to join an adventurous narrative that uncovers Earth’s hidden mysteries. Inspired by the daring explorer Arctic Pablo, this project seamlessly blends storytelling with cryptocurrency, creating an immersive investment experience. Unlike traditional presales, Arctic Pablo Coin’s offering is structured around a journey through various mystical locations, each representing a phase in the presale. Currently, the expedition has reached ChillVille, the 13th phase, with tokens priced at $0.000070. This innovative approach adds an element of adventure and creates a sense of urgency, as each new location brings a price increase. Arctic Pablo Coin employs a deflationary model through a robust token burn mechanism. Unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation weekly during the presale, and any remaining tokens post-presale will also be burned. This strategy enhances scarcity, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. Investors have the opportunity to stake their APC tokens, earning a remarkable 66% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). Staked coins will be vested for two months from the launch date, encouraging long-term participation and stability within the community. It is one of the top new meme coins to join now. Early investors stand to gain substantially. With the current presale price at $0.000070 and a projected launch price of $0.008, there’s an anticipated ROI of over 11,285.71% from Stage 13 to the listing price. For instance, a $500 investment now would yield approximately 7,140,635 APCs, which could escalate to $57,125.08 upon reaching the listing price. Given that Arctic Pablo’s prices are poised to rise soon, this phase may conclude at any moment, marking the last chance to invest at this low entry point. Dog (Bitcoin): Bridging Communities and Expanding Horizons Dog (Bitcoin), often referred to as DOG, has made significant strides in the meme coin arena. Originally rooted in the Bitcoin network, DOG has recently expanded its reach by bridging over to the Solana blockchain. This strategic move aims to leverage Solana’s high throughput and low fees, targeting its vibrant community and enhancing accessibility for traders. The decision to bridge DOG to Solana reflects a strategic effort to tap into Solana’s robust ecosystem, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. This expansion is expected to attract a broader user base, particularly those engaged in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thereby increasing DOG’s utility and market presence. Like many meme coins, DOG has experienced volatility. However, its recent expansion efforts and community-driven initiatives have bolstered investor confidence. The bridging to Solana is anticipated to provide more liquidity and trading opportunities, potentially stabilizing its market performance in the long run. Degen: The Wildcard of Meme Coins Degen has emerged as a powerhouse in the meme coin sector, driven by a vibrant online community and an aggressive marketing campaign. Unlike many other meme coins, Degen embraces its chaotic nature, leveraging viral trends and internet culture to fuel its growth. Degen has been on a meteoric rise, capturing attention with its unpredictable price swings and high trading volumes. Its high-risk, high-reward nature has made it a favorite among traders looking to capitalize on short-term gains. Unlike Arctic Pablo, which is built on an adventure-driven narrative, Degen thrives on its unpredictability, making it a compelling choice for those who enjoy the thrill of volatile investments. Degen’s tokenomics are structured to encourage trading activity, focusing on incentivizing liquidity providers and active participants in the ecosystem. With frequent airdrops and community-driven promotions, the token maintains high engagement levels. Conclusion: The Final Verdict on the Top Meme Coins to Join Now Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Dog (Bitcoin), and Degen each offer distinct opportunities for investors. Arctic Pablo Coin presents a structured and engaging investment with a strong deflationary mechanism and high ROI potential. Dog (Bitcoin) capitalizes on blockchain interoperability, leveraging Solana’s efficiency to expand its reach. Degen, on the other hand, embraces volatility, catering to high-risk traders who thrive on speculation. The window of opportunity for Arctic Pablo Coin is closing fast as it progresses through its adventurous presale. With prices set to rise soon, now is the best time to jump in and secure a position before the next phase begins.

The decentralized lending protocol announced the portal’s activation on a Mar. 5 post on X, advising users to verify communications through official channels before accessing their claims. The exploit drained $9.6 million from zkLend’s pools, prompting the platform to halt withdrawals and investigate the breach. Shortly after the hack, blockchain security firm Cyvers reported that the stolen funds were bridged to the Ethereum ( ETH ) network. The hacker attempted to launder the funds through Railgun, a privacy protocol. However, Railgun’s internal policies forced the return of the stolen assets to the hacker’s original address. Following the attack, zkLend attempted to negotiate with the hacker, offering a 10% “white hat” bounty in exchange for the return of the remaining 3,300 ETH. The funds were not retrieved despite a Feb. 14 deadline. To track down the stolen funds, zkLend has enlisted the help of law enforcement and leading experts from Binance Security, StarkWare, and the Starknet Foundation.

Meanwhile, BitLemons ($BLEM) has quietly positioned itself for potential explosive growth with its revolutionary GambleFi protocol, which is already generating revenue. As traditional cryptocurrencies struggle with bearish pressure, BLEM’s presale continues accelerating. Stage 1 is ultimately selling out in 16 days—a clear signal that smart money is moving fast before the next price jump. Is BitLemons’ Casino-Driven Revenue Model the Perfect Hedge Against Market Volatility? BitLemons stands at the cutting edge of the emerging GambleFi sector, targeting disruption of the massive $450 billion traditional casino industry. Unlike speculative tokens with no real-world utility, BLEM powers a fully functional crypto casino featuring over 8,000 games from premium providers including Evolution and Pragmatic. This infrastructure enables BitLemons to generate consistent revenue regardless of broader market conditions – a rare advantage in the volatile crypto space. The project’s recent fundraising success has been remarkable, securing $1 million in its private seed round from strategic investors who recognize its potential. What truly sets BitLemons apart is its revolutionary tokenomics structure, which allocates a substantial 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) directly to enhancing token value—with 15% dedicated to strategic buyback and burn operations and another 15% flowing to staking rewards. Security concerns have plagued many crypto projects, but BitLemons has established a new industry standard with dual security audits from respected firms SpyWolf and SolidProof. This level of validation provides investors with confidence that simply isn’t available from competitors in the space. The presale structure features three progressive stages, with the current issue price set at just $0.02 – a fraction of the rumored 17-18¢ listing price that industry insiders are projecting. The momentum behind BitLemons is undeniable, with Stage 1 selling out in a mere 16 days and Stage 2 now priced at double the initial entry point. As investors rush to secure their positions before the subsequent inevitable price increase, the window of opportunity for maximum returns narrows rapidly. Can Bitcoin Recover After Its Dramatic 11% Weekend Crash? Bitcoin has faced severe selling pressure over the past 48 hours, plummeting from its intraday high of $93,666 to the current $82,521 – a steep 11.13% decline that has sent shockwaves through the market. Despite positive sentiment from high-profile figures, including Eric Trump’s recent “HOLD” advice that briefly sparked buying interest, this dramatic pullback has occurred. Technical analysis reveals concerning developments. Trading volume has surged by 12.85% to $72.03B in the past 24 hours, indicating significant distribution taking place at higher levels. Key support levels at $85,000 have been decisively broken, with the next major support zone between $80,000 and $82,000 now being tested. The community sentiment remains cautiously bullish at 79%, suggesting many investors view this correction as a potential buying opportunity rather than the start of a prolonged downtrend. Will Polkadot’s ETF Filing and 2.0 Launch Reverse Its 17% Freefall? Polkadot has experienced a significant price deterioration, dropping its value from $5.14 to $4.21, representing a substantial 17.61% decline. Despite this bearish price action, fundamental developments strengthen Polkadot’s long-term outlook, creating a potential disconnect between current valuation and prospects. The most notable catalyst appears to be Grayscale Investments’ recent filing for a Polkadot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), aiming to provide traditional investors with exposure to DOT. This development follows similar XRP and Cardano ETFs filings, potentially opening the floodgates for institutional capital. Additionally, the cryptocurrency community is buzzing with anticipation for Polkadot 2.0, scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. This major upgrade promises to enhance scalability, flexibility, and developer accessibility – potentially transforming Polkadot into a more versatile platform for decentralized applications. Why BitLemons Represents the Rare ‘Ground Floor’ Opportunity As Bitcoin and Polkadot demonstrate, even established cryptocurrencies can experience significant volatility and downside risk. BitLemons, however, offers a compelling alternative with its revenue-generating model that’s already operational and growing. While most crypto projects sell promises and roadmaps, BitLemons delivers actual revenue through its thriving casino platform – revenue that directly benefits token holders through buybacks and staking rewards. Have you considered how rare it is to discover a project with both immediate utility and exponential growth potential? BitLemons stands alone with its dual security audits, proven revenue model, and strategic tokenomics designed to reward early investors. The rapid sellout of Stage 1 and the current Stage 2 presale represent what could be your final opportunity to secure tokens at these prices before the project achieves its expected 17X return upon exchange listing.

The expert highlights that this resistance has never been broken without a major rally following. He notes that when XRP has broken this level before, it surged at least 160%. As the current market cap of XRP is just 46.48% lower than that of Ethereum, a powerful rally, strong enough to cover this, could help the former surpass the later in terms of market capitalisation. $XRP is attempting to break the largest resistance in history against $ETH Price historically has ONLY ever went parabolic if broken, which at minimum has printed a 160% move after breaking this zone Even half of that and $XRP flips $ETH Alerts set for a confirmed break… https://t.co/XIxjaLKNBG pic.twitter.com/ionYN68GCr — Dom (@traderview2) March 5, 2025 Resistance Is Becoming Support – A Bullish Signal for XRP $XRP vs $ETH update XRP is in the process of flipping the most important resistance in history, to support The last time this was support was March 2020… This could be the start of a huge shift where $ETH severely underperforms or $XRP strongly outperforms pic.twitter.com/FD5HzcggXu — Dom (@traderview2) March 4, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Price Prediction: Debates Over a U.S. Crypto Reserve and Its Impact on Prices , Dom states that XRP is currently turning the resistance into a support level. He observes that the last time this happened was in March 2020. The crypto expert predicts that this could be the beginning of a huge shift in the XRP/ETH market. If XRP confirms the breakout, it could strongly outperform ETH. In conclusion, the price action of XRP is at a crucial point. If it successfully breaks resistance and turns it into support, a major rally could follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Alec Radford, instrumental in developing core AI technologies at OpenAI, has been subpoenaed in a significant AI copyright case. This legal move underscores the intensifying debate around intellectual property in the age of rapidly advancing AI and has significant implications for how AI models are trained and the future of content creation itself. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, accustomed to navigating the complexities of digital ownership and innovation, this lawsuit presents a parallel challenge in the realm of artificial intelligence. OpenAI Copyright Lawsuit Heats Up with Alec Radford Subpoena The legal battle, titled “re OpenAI ChatGPT Litigation,” has taken a new twist with the subpoena of Alec Radford. Court documents filed in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California reveal that Radford was officially served on February 25. Radford, who departed OpenAI last year to pursue independent research, is not just any former employee. He was the lead author of OpenAI’s groundbreaking research paper on generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). These GPT models are the very foundation of OpenAI’s most celebrated products, including the revolutionary chatbot, ChatGPT. His deep understanding of the technology at the heart of the OpenAI lawsuit makes his testimony potentially crucial. To understand the significance, consider Radford’s journey at OpenAI: **Early Pioneer:** Radford joined OpenAI in 2016, just a year after its inception, becoming one of the early architects of its AI prowess. **GPT Architect:** He played a vital role in developing several generations of GPT models, the engines driving much of today’s generative AI capabilities. **Diverse Contributions:** Beyond GPTs, Radford also contributed to other significant OpenAI projects like Whisper, the speech recognition model, and DALL-E, the image generation marvel. This background positions Radford as an invaluable witness in the ongoing AI copyright dispute. Why Alec Radford’s Testimony is Critical in the AI Copyright Case The heart of the “re OpenAI ChatGPT Litigation” case revolves around allegations of AI copyright infringement. Prominent book authors, including Paul Tremblay, Sarah Silverman, and Michael Chabon, initiated the lawsuit, claiming OpenAI improperly used their copyrighted works to train its AI models. They further allege that ChatGPT directly infringes on their copyrights by reproducing substantial portions of their works without proper attribution. While some initial claims were dismissed last year, the core claim of direct infringement remains active. OpenAI defends its actions by invoking “fair use,” a legal doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted material without permission under certain circumstances, such as for transformative purposes like research and education. Here’s why Radford’s testimony is so vital: **Insider Knowledge:** As the lead researcher on GPTs, Radford possesses firsthand knowledge of how these models were developed and, crucially, how they were trained. This includes insights into the data used for training, which is central to the copyright infringement claims. **Technical Expertise:** Radford can explain the intricate technical processes involved in training large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, demystifying the technology for the court and clarifying whether and how copyrighted material was utilized. **Perspective on Intent:** His testimony could shed light on OpenAI’s intentions and understanding regarding copyright considerations during the development and training phases of their AI models. Essentially, Radford can provide a crucial inside perspective on the technical realities and developmental decisions behind OpenAI’s AI, directly impacting the assessment of the AI copyright allegations. The Broader Battleground: AI Model Training and Copyright Law The subpoena of Radford is not an isolated event. Attorneys for the plaintiffs are also seeking depositions from other former OpenAI figures, Dario Amodei and Benjamin Mann, who are now leading Anthropic, a competing AI company. These efforts to compel testimony from key individuals highlight the comprehensive nature of the plaintiffs’ legal strategy and the high stakes involved. Amodei and Mann initially resisted these depositions, arguing they were overly burdensome. However, a U.S. magistrate judge recently ruled that Amodei must indeed be deposed for several hours regarding his work at OpenAI in this and another related AI copyright case brought by the Authors Guild. This ruling signals a significant step forward for the plaintiffs and underscores the court’s seriousness in examining these issues. This legal clash extends beyond OpenAI and these specific individuals. It touches upon fundamental questions concerning: **Fair Use in AI Training:** Is the use of copyrighted material to train AI models truly “fair use,” or does it constitute infringement? This is a central legal question with far-reaching implications for the AI industry. ChatGPT Copyright and Output: Do AI outputs, like text generated by ChatGPT, infringe on copyrights if they are derived from copyrighted training data? This raises complex questions about derivative works and the nature of AI-generated content. **The Future of AI Development:** The outcomes of these cases could significantly shape how AI companies approach data sourcing and model training in the future, potentially impacting the pace and direction of AI innovation. Navigating the Uncharted Waters of AI Copyright – What’s Next? The Alec Radford subpoena and the broader legal battles against OpenAI and Anthropic are pivotal moments in the evolving landscape of AI copyright law. The courts are now tasked with grappling with complex technological and legal questions that will set precedents for the entire AI industry. The core tension lies between fostering innovation in AI and protecting the rights of content creators in the digital age. As this case progresses, several key aspects will be closely watched: **Radford’s Deposition:** What insights will Radford’s testimony provide? Will it bolster or weaken either side’s arguments? **Court Rulings on Fair Use:** How will the court interpret the fair use doctrine in the context of AI model training? This will be a landmark decision. **Industry-Wide Impact:** Regardless of the specific outcomes, these cases are already prompting AI companies and the broader tech industry to re-evaluate their approaches to data usage and copyright compliance. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain world, this AI copyright saga is a reminder of the ongoing need to balance technological advancement with ethical and legal considerations in the digital realm. Just as blockchain technology seeks to redefine ownership and rights in decentralized systems, the AI copyright debate is forcing a critical examination of these concepts in the context of increasingly intelligent machines. The resolution of this lawsuit will not only determine the fate of OpenAI in this specific case but will also cast a long shadow over the future development and deployment of AI technologies across various sectors.

Leading the charge in this dynamic sector, Riot Platforms, a prominent U.S.-based Bitcoin mining company, has just announced a significant milestone. February witnessed Riot Platforms achieving an impressive feat, mining a substantial 470 BTC. This robust production underscores the company’s operational prowess and strategic growth within the competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining. Let’s delve deeper into what this achievement signifies for Riot Platforms and the broader cryptocurrency market. Riot Platforms’ February Bitcoin Mining Performance: A Deep Dive Riot Platforms’ latest press release, disseminated via PR Newswire, highlights not just the 470 BTC mined in February, but also their considerable Bitcoin holdings. As of February month-end, Riot Platforms proudly holds a total of 18,692 BTC. This figure is not merely a number; it represents a strategic accumulation of digital gold, positioning Riot Platforms as a significant player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s break down the key highlights of their February performance: Impressive Mining Output: Riot Platforms successfully mined 470 BTC in February. This demonstrates their efficient mining operations and ability to capitalize on the opportunities within the Bitcoin network. Substantial Bitcoin Holdings: Holding 18,692 BTC is a testament to Riot Platforms’ long-term vision and belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. These holdings act as a significant reserve asset, potentially appreciating as Bitcoin adoption grows. Strategic Growth: These figures reflect Riot Platforms’ ongoing expansion and optimization of their mining infrastructure. The company is continually investing in technology and capacity to enhance its mining capabilities. But what exactly does it take to mine Bitcoin, and why are these numbers significant in the context of the larger cryptocurrency landscape? Understanding the Significance of Bitcoin Mining in the Cryptocurrency Realm Bitcoin mining is the backbone of the Bitcoin network. It’s the process that validates and adds new transaction records to the blockchain, ensuring the network’s security and functionality. Miners like Riot Platforms use powerful computers to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. This process is vital for several reasons: Network Security: Mining secures the Bitcoin network against attacks. The computational power required to mine Bitcoin makes it incredibly difficult and costly for malicious actors to tamper with the blockchain. Transaction Verification: Miners verify and process Bitcoin transactions, ensuring that all transactions are legitimate and preventing double-spending. New Bitcoin Creation: Mining is the mechanism through which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation. This controlled supply is a key characteristic of Bitcoin’s deflationary nature. Decentralization: Bitcoin mining is designed to be decentralized, with miners distributed globally. This decentralization enhances the resilience and censorship-resistance of the Bitcoin network. Riot Platforms’ mining operations contribute directly to this essential process, bolstering the Bitcoin network’s strength and reliability. Their February output of 470 BTC is a tangible contribution to the network’s growth and security. Analyzing Riot Platforms’ BTC Holdings Strategy Holding 18,692 BTC is a strategic decision by Riot Platforms, reflecting a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future. Companies accumulating Bitcoin are essentially betting on the long-term appreciation of this digital asset. Here’s why such substantial BTC holdings are noteworthy: Benefit Description Potential for Appreciation As Bitcoin adoption increases and its scarcity becomes more pronounced, the value of Bitcoin is expected to rise. Holding a significant amount of BTC positions Riot Platforms to benefit from this potential appreciation. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, as its supply is capped at 21 million coins. In times of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin can serve as a store of value. Diversification of Assets For a company like Riot Platforms, holding BTC diversifies their asset portfolio beyond traditional financial instruments. This diversification can mitigate risks and enhance overall financial stability. Strategic Reserve Large BTC holdings provide Riot Platforms with a strategic reserve that can be used for future investments, operational expenses, or to capitalize on emerging opportunities within the cryptocurrency space. Riot Platforms’ decision to hold onto a significant portion of the Bitcoin they mine demonstrates a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role in the future financial system. The Competitive Landscape of Bitcoin Mining Operations The mining operations sector is highly competitive, with companies vying for computational power and efficiency to maximize their Bitcoin output. Riot Platforms operates in this dynamic environment, constantly seeking to optimize its infrastructure and strategies. Key factors influencing success in Bitcoin mining include: Energy Efficiency: Mining is energy-intensive. Companies that can secure access to cost-effective and sustainable energy sources gain a significant competitive advantage. Technological Advancements: The development of more powerful and energy-efficient mining hardware (ASICs) is crucial for staying competitive. Continuous upgrades and adoption of new technologies are essential. Scalability: The ability to scale mining operations quickly and efficiently is vital for responding to market opportunities and increasing mining output. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with technology providers, energy companies, and other stakeholders can enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs. Riot Platforms’ reported mining figures suggest they are effectively navigating this competitive landscape, leveraging their resources and expertise to achieve notable Bitcoin production. Looking Ahead: Future Prospects for Riot Platforms and Bitcoin Mining The future of Bitcoin mining and companies like Riot Platforms is intertwined with the broader trajectory of the cryptocurrency market. Several factors will shape their path forward: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations directly impact miner profitability. While price volatility presents challenges, it also offers opportunities for significant gains during bull markets. Regulatory Environment: Government regulations regarding cryptocurrency mining and energy consumption are evolving globally. Navigating these regulations and ensuring compliance is crucial for miners. Technological Innovation: Continued advancements in mining technology, including more energy-efficient ASICs and innovative cooling solutions, will drive efficiency and sustainability in mining operations. Decentralization Debates: Ongoing discussions about the centralization of mining power and potential solutions like mining pools and geographically distributed operations will shape the industry’s future. Riot Platforms, with its strong February performance and substantial Bitcoin holdings, appears well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities and navigate the challenges within the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Their commitment to expanding their mining capacity and strategically holding Bitcoin signals a confident outlook on the future of digital assets. Conclusion: Riot Platforms’ Impressive February Marks a Strong Step Forward Riot Platforms’ announcement of mining 470 BTC in February and holding 18,692 BTC is more than just a numerical update; it’s a powerful indicator of the company’s operational strength, strategic vision, and commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem. This achievement underscores the continued relevance and importance of Bitcoin mining in the cryptocurrency space. As Bitcoin adoption grows and the digital asset landscape matures, companies like Riot Platforms, with their robust infrastructure and strategic Bitcoin accumulation, are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of finance. Their February performance is a testament to their capabilities and a compelling sign of their ongoing success in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency mining.

This sudden move comes as ETH struggles to hold its ground, with prices up 6.96% at $2,244 but trading volumes dropping 14% . Ethereum Whale Offloads 40K ETH On March 4 and 5, the Ethereum whale moved 30,000 ETH to Galaxy Digital and another 10,000 ETH to FalconX. In return, they received $20 million USDC from Galaxy Digital and $19.49 million USDC from FalconX. This sale has sparked discussions in the crypto community, especially as the whale originally received 114,500 ETH from the Genesis Trading liquidation. At the time of the compensation, ETH was priced at $3,128. However, the market drop has wiped out nearly 30% of its value, reducing the worth of the whale’s holdings by $110 million. This large transfer suggests that the whale might be preparing for further price sell-off. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin ETFs Bleed $143M While Ethereum Saw Massive Inflow , Ethereum’s Struggle Continues Ethereum has been under pressure in recent weeks, losing over 13% in just the last seven days. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows that unrealized profits among ETH whales have dropped to levels last seen during the previous bear market. With the ETH/BTC ratio declining, fear and uncertainty are growing in the market.

In contrast, 69.7 million ETH remains at a loss, making up 92.40% of the total supply. Moreover, more than 60,000 ETH has been moved to exchanges in the past two weeks, signaling increased selling pressure. Ethereum Price Analysis As of now, Ethereum’s price is currently hovering around $2,250, after facing strong resistance at $2,400. Analysts suggest that breaking past this level could push ETH towards $3,000. However, if the selling pressure continues, ETH could drop further, with support levels between $2,015 and $2,368 offering some relief. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

41183880,https://finbold.com/?p=239907,1741168933,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,2 cryptocurrencies to reach a $5 billion market cap in March,https://finbold.com/2-cryptocurrencies-to-reach-a-5-billion-market-cap-in-march/,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) staged a sharp recovery, rebounding from a sell-off sparked by Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on US imports from Canada and Mexico. The downturn wiped out $460 billion from the total crypto market capitalization, triggering $985 million in liquidations and sending BTC plunging to $82,000. Despite the sharp sell-off, Bitcoin regained momentum, surging 4% in 24 hours to trade at $87,300 at press time. While uncertainty still looms, some altcoins are showing strength, pushing toward key valuation milestones. With liquidity returning to the market, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies, Aave ( AAVE ) and Aptos ( APT ), as being on track to reach a $5 billion market cap by March, driven by growing institutional interest and a rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem. Aave (AAVE) Currently trading at $222.87 with a market capitalization of $3.4 billion, Aave has surged over 26% in the past 24 hours. To reach a $5 billion market cap, Aave would need to climb to approximately $327 per token, a target that now appears increasingly within reach. Aave price and market cap. Source: Finbold A major catalyst for this growth is the tokenomics overhaul proposal , which is subject to community approval and has been described by Marc Zeller, the founder of Aave Chan Initiative (ACI), as ‘the most important proposal’ in Aave’s history. The proposal includes a $1 million weekly AAVE buyback for six months, an ‘Umbrella’ safety mechanism designed to protect users from bad debt ‘up to billions’, and a new revenue model. Aave protocol revenue remains strong despite market conditions, and the cash portion of the Aave DAO has increased by 115% since the adoption of the Aavenomics update in 2024, now sitting at $115 million. Meanwhile, Aave continues to assert its dominance in the DeFi sector, with total value locked (TVL) surpassing $18 billion, nearly equal to the combined TVL of other major lending protocols, according to DeFiLlama . Over the past seven days, the protocol has generated more than $8.08 million in fees, further highlighting sustained network activity despite broader market volatility. Its expansion to Layer 1 blockchain Sonic and increasing DeFi adoption further strengthen its growth potential. With technical indicators pointing to continued upside and with the potential approval of the proposal, Aave could hit a $5 billion market cap in March. Aptos (APT) Currently trading at $5.87 with a market capitalization of $3.5 billion, Aptos would need a 42.86% surge to hit the $5 billion mark, pushing its price toward $8.48. Aptos price and market cap. Source: Finbold Despite recent market fluctuations, key indicators suggest Aptos could be on track for significant growth. Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged from just 12 million APT at the start of 2024 to over 165 million APT, indicating strong DeFi activity and increasing capital inflows. At the same time, Aptos’ stablecoin market cap has soared from $49.18 million to over $833 million, a sign of the network’s growing liquidity. Institutional interest is also gaining traction, with Bitwise filing for an Aptos trust, a move that could pave the way for a potential APT ETF, opening doors for increased investor participation. Meanwhile, derivatives data remains bullish , with open interest up 4.23% to $141.94 million and a long/short ratio above 2 on Binance and OKX, suggesting traders are heavily positioning for further gains. With strong network expansion, surging liquidity, and rising institutional interest, Aptos appears well-positioned to break past the $5 billion market cap milestone in March. That being said, a return to a $5 billion market cap for Aave and Aptos appears increasingly likely, considering both assets surpassed this level just months ago. If market conditions hold steady and Bitcoin reclaims the $100,000 mark, momentum could drive both assets back to this key threshold by March.

The main factor that will decide XRP’s trend in 2025 is the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . However, there’s more in store for XRP, as in a recent announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned XRP being included in the newly formed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. Talking about efforts and progress being made at Ripple Team’s end, Monica Long, President at Ripple highlighted that RLUSD stable coin will serve as the basic necessity for the entire Ripple ecosystem. She mentioned how the Ripple blockchain network allows users to tokenize, store, move, and exchange assets.

If things go in favor of Ripple, XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89.

XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11.

While Litecoin’s legacy as “digital silver” is well-known, Skyren’s fresh approach to airdrop farming and community rewards is turning heads. Let’s explore how these two projects compare—and which might offer better opportunities in today’s crypto landscape. The Contenders: Skyren DAO & Litecoin Litecoin Launched in 2011 as a “lighter” version of Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency focused on fast, low-cost transactions. Known as “digital silver,” Litecoin has maintained its position as a top-20 cryptocurrency for years. Its strengths include: Speed: Transactions are faster than Bitcoin (2.5 minutes per block vs. 10). Security: Uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin. Merchant Adoption: Accepted by many businesses globally. However, Litecoin struggles with innovation. Its role as a payment-focused coin faces competition from newer blockchains offering smart contracts and DeFi features. Skyren DAO Skyren DAO is the world’s first airdrop-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Built on Ethereum but operating its $SKYRN token on Polygon, Skyren automates the process of collecting crypto airdrops—free tokens distributed by blockchain projects. Skyren’s focus is simple: help users earn rewards passively while avoiding the complexities of manual airdrop hunting. Skyren DAO’s Game-Changing Features Skyren DAO isn’t just another crypto project—it’s reshaping how users interact with decentralized finance. Here’s what makes it stand out: 1. Automated Airdrop Farming Skyren scans all layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains to find airdrop opportunities. Users earn rewards by holding $SKYRN tokens, which represent a share of the DAO’s airdrop collections. 2. AI-Driven Governance Skyren uses artificial intelligence to optimize airdrop strategies and manage its treasury. This ensures rewards are maximized while risks are minimized. 3. Referral Program & Spin the Wheel Skyren rewards users for spreading the word: 10% Bonus: Referrers and new buyers both earn extra tokens. Spin the Wheel: A daily game where users can win crypto prizes, adding fun to the earning process. 4. Audited Security Skyren’s smart contracts are audited for safety , and the $SKYRN token is verified on PolygonScan , ensuring transparency. 5. 216% APY Potential By combining airdrop rewards, staking, and DeFi strategies, Skyren projects an average annual return of 216% for token holders. How Skyren Outshines Legacy Projects While Litecoin offers stability, Skyren DAO provides modern solutions for today’s crypto users: Feature Litecoin Skyren DAO Focus Payments & transactions Passive rewards via airdrops Innovation Limited updates since 2011 AI-driven, cross-chain farming Earning Potential Minimal (transaction fees) 216% APY from multi-chain rewards and very low transaction fees User Engagement Basic wallet transactions Spin the Wheel, referrals, DAO voting Skyren’s model taps into the booming DeFi sector, while Litecoin remains tied to its original payment-focused design. Stay informed and inspired by following Skyren DAO on Instagram , where updates and insights are shared regularly. Presale Opportunity & Tokenomics Skyren’s Phase 5 presale is underway at $0.048 per token, with a limited supply of 5 million $SKYRN. Key details: Next Phase: $0.052 Launch Price: $0.16 (potential 500% ROI for early buyers) Token Utility: Holders earn rewards across Ethereum, Polygon, and other chains. Conclusion Litecoin’s legacy as a fast, reliable cryptocurrency is undeniable. However, its lack of innovation in the DeFi era leaves room for projects like Skyren DAO to thrive. By automating airdrop farming, offering gamified rewards like Spin the Wheel, and leveraging AI for governance, Skyren provides a fresh approach that aligns with modern crypto trends. For investors seeking passive income and exposure to cutting-edge DeFi strategies, Skyren DAO offers a compelling opportunity. While Litecoin remains a stable choice, Skyren’s community-driven model and explosive growth potential position it as a strong contender in the next generation of crypto projects.

The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market just experienced a significant shift. After a period of generally positive momentum, we’re seeing a notable outflow. On March 4th, these ETFs collectively witnessed a net outflow of $143.44 million. This marks the second consecutive day of withdrawals, signaling a potential cooling off period after the initial fervor surrounding these investment vehicles. Let’s break down what happened and what it might mean for the future of Bitcoin ETFs. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Outflows: Who Led the Charge? When we talk about Bitcoin ETF outflows , it’s crucial to understand where these withdrawals are originating. According to data from Trader T on X (formerly Twitter), Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with a substantial $46.08 million in outflows. Following closely behind were ARK Invest’s ARKB and Franklin’s EZBC, recording $43.92 million and $35.71 million in outflows respectively. Other ETFs experiencing net withdrawals include Bitwise’s BITB ($23.96 million), Invesco’s BTCO ($16.47 million), and WisdomTree’s BTCW ($13.07 million). This broad sweep across multiple funds suggests a wider market sentiment shift, rather than isolated incidents. ETF Net Outflow/Inflow (USD Million) Fidelity (FBTC) -$46.08 ARK Invest (ARKB) -$43.92 Franklin (EZBC) -$35.71 Bitwise (BITB) -$23.96 Invesco (BTCO) -$16.47 WisdomTree (BTCW) -$13.07 Grayscale (GBTC) +$35.77 BlackRock (IBIT) No Change The Grayscale Anomaly: A Lone Wolf Inflow Amidst ETF Outflows? Interestingly, amidst the sea of red, Grayscale’s BTC ETF (GBTC) stood out as the only fund to register a net inflow. It attracted $35.77 million on March 4th. This is a noteworthy deviation from the overall trend. Why is Grayscale seeing inflows while others are experiencing ETF outflows ? Several factors could be at play: Potential Value Proposition: After converting to a spot ETF, GBTC has been trading with lower fees compared to its previous structure, but still generally higher than newer ETFs. Perhaps some investors see a long-term value in Grayscale despite its past challenges. Investor Strategy: It’s possible that some investors are strategically shifting assets. Inflows into GBTC might represent a specific trading strategy, perhaps related to arbitrage or portfolio rebalancing within the broader spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. Short Covering: While less likely to be the primary driver of a $35 million inflow, short covering activity in GBTC could contribute to positive flow. It’s important to remember that market dynamics are complex, and a single day’s data doesn’t necessarily dictate a long-term trend. However, the divergence between Grayscale and other ETFs warrants close observation. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: Beyond the Outflows Despite these recent Bitcoin ETF outflows , it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been largely considered a success, providing mainstream investors with easier access to Bitcoin exposure. Funds like BlackRock’s IBIT, which reported no change in holdings on March 4th, have been consistently accumulating Bitcoin since their inception. Here’s a quick recap of the overall positive impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs: Increased Accessibility: Spot Bitcoin ETFs have democratized Bitcoin investment, allowing investors to gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. Institutional Adoption: These ETFs have paved the way for greater institutional participation in the Bitcoin market. Market Maturation: The launch of these regulated products is a significant step towards the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges and volatility inherent in the crypto market. Navigating ETF Outflows: What Does This Mean for Investors? So, what should investors make of these ETF outflows ? Here are a few points to consider: Market Fluctuations are Normal: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Days of outflows are not unexpected and are part of the natural ebb and flow of the market. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term Bitcoin holders, short-term ETF flows might be less concerning. Focus on the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin adoption and its long-term potential. Monitor Trends: Keep an eye on ETF flow data over the coming days and weeks to see if this is a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained trend. Diversification: As always, diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is a Bitcoin ETF. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin ETFs: Will Outflows Continue? The recent spot Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a reminder that the market is dynamic and subject to shifts in investor sentiment. While the initial hype surrounding these ETFs was substantial, sustained growth requires continued confidence and capital inflow. Whether these outflows represent a temporary pause or a more significant trend remains to be seen. Market participants will be closely watching the daily flow data to gauge the ongoing appetite for these groundbreaking investment products. In conclusion, the $143.44 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 4th is a noteworthy event, particularly given it’s the second consecutive day of withdrawals. While Grayscale bucked the trend with inflows, the overall picture suggests a temporary cooling in ETF demand. Investors should monitor these trends closely, maintaining a balanced perspective on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The journey of spot Bitcoin ETFs is still in its early stages, and navigating market fluctuations is part of the process.

When Will Ripple (XRP) Be Next?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-drops-another-cryptocurrency-case-when-will-ripple-xrp-be-next/,"The SEC has been dropping a series of cryptocurrency lawsuits in recent days, most recently dropping the case against Cumberland DRW. The SEC has agreed to drop its enforcement action against cryptocurrency trading firm Cumberland DRW. This comes after the SEC's decision to drop its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken a day earlier. Cumberland announced today that it has entered into a joint agreement with the SEC to drop the lawsuit against them. “Today, we signed a joint filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissing its lawsuit against Cumberland DRW. The filing was agreed in principle between Cumberland DRW and SEC staff on February 20 and is currently awaiting Commission approval. As a firm deeply committed to the principles of integrity and transparency, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with the SEC to help shape a future where technological advances and regulatory clarity go hand in hand, ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of global financial innovation.” The lawsuit, filed last October, accused Cumberland of operating as an unregistered securities dealer and selling $2 billion worth of unregistered securities, including Solana (SOL), Polygon (POL), Cosmos (ATOM), Algorand (ALGO), and Filecoin (FIL). When Will It Be Ripple's Turn? While the SEC has recently dismissed lawsuits against various cryptocurrency companies such as Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap, and Gemini, it has yet to take action regarding the Ripple case.

The Sunshine State might just be turning even brighter for Bitcoin. Imagine Florida, known for its beaches and oranges, potentially becoming a pioneer in digital asset adoption on a state level. This isn’t just chatter; a Republican gubernatorial candidate, Byron Donalds, is making waves with a bold proposal: incorporating Bitcoin (BTC) into Florida’s strategic reserves. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking idea entails and what it could mean for the future of both Florida and the wider crypto world. Why Florida is Eyeing Bitcoin for Strategic Reserves? According to a recent X (formerly Twitter) post by Matthew Siegel, the head of digital asset research at VanEck, Byron Donalds isn’t just casually suggesting Bitcoin. He’s making a strong case for it as a vital component of Florida’s financial strategy. Donalds emphasizes Bitcoin’s proven track record as a store of value and wealth. But why now, and why Bitcoin? Bitcoin as a Modern Store of Value: In an era of fluctuating global economies and concerns about inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainties. Its decentralized nature and limited supply of 21 million coins make it a unique asset class. Diversification and Risk Mitigation: Governments and large institutions are constantly seeking ways to diversify their portfolios to mitigate financial risks. Adding Bitcoin to Florida’s reserves could be a strategic move to diversify away from traditional assets and potentially enhance long-term financial stability. Future-Proofing State Finances: Embracing Bitcoin now could position Florida as a forward-thinking state, attracting innovation, tech talent, and potentially new businesses in the burgeoning digital asset space. This move could be seen as an investment in the future of finance. The $1.85 Billion Bitcoin Reserve: A Bold Financial Bet? The numbers being discussed are not insignificant. Florida is reportedly considering acquiring up to a staggering $1.85 billion worth of Bitcoin. This is not pocket change; it’s a substantial investment that signals serious intent. However, it’s crucial to understand that this is contingent on the approval of a state Bitcoin reserve bill. So, what are the potential benefits and challenges of such a massive undertaking? Potential Benefits of Florida’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserves: Enhanced Financial Security: As Donalds pointed out, Bitcoin can act as a buffer against potential future financial risks. In times of economic downturn or currency devaluation, Bitcoin’s uncorrelated nature to traditional markets could provide a safety net for state finances. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically shown significant price appreciation over time. If Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, Florida’s investment could generate substantial returns, boosting state revenue and potentially funding public services. Attracting Crypto Investment and Innovation: A state-level Bitcoin reserve could send a powerful message to the cryptocurrency industry, making Florida an even more attractive destination for crypto businesses, investors, and innovators. This could lead to job creation and economic growth within the state. Leading the Way in Digital Finance: Florida could position itself as a national leader in embracing digital assets. This first-mover advantage could enhance the state’s reputation for innovation and attract further investment and attention. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. A significant downturn in the Bitcoin market could negatively impact the value of Florida’s reserves, at least in the short term. Careful risk management strategies would be essential. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in the United States. Changes in federal or state regulations could impact the legality or practicality of holding Bitcoin as a state reserve. Security and Custody: Securely storing and managing such a large amount of Bitcoin is a critical concern. Florida would need to implement robust security measures to protect against theft or loss. Public Perception and Political Debate: Such a bold move is likely to spark public debate and political scrutiny. Educating the public and addressing concerns about risk and volatility will be crucial for gaining and maintaining support. Strategic Reserves and Bitcoin: Is This the Future? The concept of incorporating Bitcoin into strategic reserves is relatively new, but it’s gaining traction in a world increasingly aware of the limitations of traditional financial systems. Nations and states are starting to explore alternative assets to diversify their holdings and safeguard against economic uncertainties. Could Florida’s potential move be a sign of things to come? Let’s consider the broader implications: Aspect Traditional Strategic Reserves (e.g., Gold) Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve Decentralization Centralized control, often by governments Decentralized, no single point of failure Supply Supply can fluctuate, influenced by mining and reserves Fixed supply of 21 million coins, scarcity built-in Accessibility Physical storage, potential logistical challenges Digital, easily transferable and storable Volatility Generally less volatile than Bitcoin Historically more volatile, but volatility may decrease with maturity Modernity Established, traditional asset Emerging, innovative asset class As you can see, Bitcoin offers a unique set of characteristics that differentiate it from traditional strategic reserves like gold. Its digital nature, decentralized structure, and fixed supply appeal to a growing number of investors and institutions seeking alternatives in the digital age. Gubernatorial Candidate’s Vision: A Bold Stance on Bitcoin Byron Donalds’ proposal to integrate Bitcoin into Florida’s reserves is undoubtedly a gubernatorial candidate making a bold statement. It reflects a forward-thinking approach to state finances and a willingness to embrace innovation. Whether this proposal gains traction and ultimately becomes policy remains to be seen. However, the fact that a prominent political figure is advocating for such a move highlights the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. Donalds’ stance could resonate with a segment of voters who are pro-crypto, tech-savvy, or seeking alternative financial solutions. It also positions him as a candidate willing to challenge traditional norms and explore new avenues for economic growth and stability in Florida. Navigating the Cryptocurrency Landscape: What’s Next for Florida? If Florida does proceed with this plan, it will be navigating largely uncharted territory for a U.S. state. Careful planning, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance will be paramount. Here are some actionable insights as we watch this story unfold: Monitor Legislative Developments: Keep an eye on the progress of the state’s Bitcoin reserve bill. Track any amendments, debates, and votes to understand the likelihood of its passage. Assess Risk Management Strategies: Look for details on how Florida plans to manage the volatility and security risks associated with holding Bitcoin. Transparency in risk management will be crucial. Engage in Informed Discussions: Participate in constructive conversations about the benefits and challenges of state-level Bitcoin adoption. Educate yourself and others about the technology and its potential impact. Consider Florida’s Example: If Florida succeeds, it could set a precedent for other states or even nations to explore similar strategies. This could lead to wider institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Florida’s Potential Bitcoin Revolution Florida’s potential foray into Bitcoin strategic reserves is more than just a news headline; it’s a potential paradigm shift. It represents a bold step towards integrating digital assets into mainstream finance and governance. While challenges and uncertainties remain, the vision of a state leveraging Bitcoin to enhance its financial security and embrace the future of finance is undeniably compelling.

He also stated plans to put the social media on-chain. Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, hinted at the possibility of acquiring TikTok US and suggested he might put some of the social media’s features on-chain. The social network is still accessible for US-based accounts, despite the recent ban. TikTok discontinued its service briefly on January 18, but returned to app stores and continues to be accessible for US-based content creators. Ohanian suggests putting TikTok on the blockchain Ohanian went a step further, suggesting he may put TikTok on-chain. His interest in TikTok is part of the People’s Bid for TikTok initiative. The consortium deal, also backed by Kevin O’Leary of Shark Tank, will include crowd funding and the potential to hold a small stake of the newly acquired company. For now, Ohanian has not detailed where the on-chain component will fit, but it would be possible to tokenize those small shares.

On-chain social media has been a long-running idea, with several implementations. However, there is still no mass-market social media with on-chain connections. The most active crypto-based social media was Farcaster, though it reiterated content from X. Ohanian repeated the message of many crypto startups that users should be in control of their data. He also pre-announced another development, without mentioning the nature of the new event. That was fun. Now let’s announce something big tomorrow, too. 😏 Won’t be onchain (yet), but it’ll be exciting. — Alexis Ohanian 🗽 (@alexisohanian) March 5, 2025 Ohanian is just one among the many potential buyers of TikTok. Other candidates include the American Investor Consortium, David Baszucki, co-founder of Roblox, as well as Mathan McCauley and Jimmy Donaldson (MrBeast). Interested buyers also include Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Walmart, and Oracle. TikTok was supposed to be a spin off from its parent company ByteDance, and form a TikTok US entity. The new company is the object of bids, though the deal is still in its early stages. Onchain social media may reawaken SocialFi Onchain social media may re-spark demand for SocialFi. In theory, SocialFi was supposed to offer multiple perks, but ended up benefiting early whales. One of the main ideas of SocialFi was content curation, where viral videos would pay out a share of their earnings. TikTok app icon on smartphone screen. Taken on April 15, 2021 by Ivan Radic.

Unfortunately, most social media ended up being bot-driven machines that promote insider content. Small-scale creators did not receive a significant payout. On-chain activity can also be neutral, such as providing provable time stamps to show ownership of a video. The content itself may gain an additional on-chain record, and even followers can be connected through wallets and Web3 identities. On-chain ownership may also mean content can be shared and tracked across platforms, paying out revenue to the original creator. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

After a spell of unease, the U.S. Ethereum ETF inflows scene is flashing green again. On March 4th, we witnessed a significant turnaround as Spot Ethereum ETFs collectively absorbed a net inflow of $15.86 million. This exciting development, highlighted by crypto analyst Trader T on X, signals a potential shift in investor sentiment and market dynamics. Ready to delve into the specifics of this positive wave? Let’s break down what’s happening and what it could mean for the future of Ethereum and crypto investments. What’s Behind the Sudden Surge in Ethereum ETF Inflows? For eight consecutive days, we observed net outflows from U.S. Ethereum ETF products, causing some to question immediate investor confidence. However, March 4th painted a different picture. A total net inflow of $15.86 million poured into these investment vehicles, indicating renewed interest and potentially a change in market momentum. This positive shift comes as a welcome relief and sparks optimism about the future trajectory of Ethereum and the broader crypto market. But what exactly drove this sudden reversal? While pinpointing exact causes is always challenging, several factors could be at play: Market Recovery: The broader crypto market has shown signs of stabilization and even recovery recently. Positive price action in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies may have encouraged investors to re-enter the market through ETFs. Renewed Investor Confidence: After a period of outflows, this inflow could suggest that investors are regaining confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and are seeing the recent dip as a buying opportunity. Strategic Rebalancing: Institutional investors and large players often rebalance their portfolios. This inflow might be part of such strategic adjustments, allocating more capital to Ethereum ETFs. Anticipation of Future Growth: The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve with developments like layer-2 scaling solutions and the upcoming Dencun upgrade. Investors might be positioning themselves to capitalize on anticipated future growth and adoption. Spot Ethereum ETF Performance: Who Led the Inflow Charge? Let’s take a closer look at which Spot Ethereum ETF products contributed to this impressive inflow. The data reveals a varied landscape with some clear winners and a few experiencing outflows: ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Inflow/Outflow (USD) Fidelity FETH $21.67 Million (Inflow) Grayscale ETHE $10.71 Million (Inflow) Grayscale EZET (Mini ETH Trust) $8.46 Million (Inflow) BlackRock ETHA $24.98 Million (Outflow) Other ETFs Various No Change As the table illustrates, Fidelity’s FETH ETF took the crown with the largest inflow of $21.67 million. Interestingly, Grayscale’s ETHE and their Mini ETH Trust (EZET) also saw substantial inflows, totaling over $19 million combined. However, BlackRock’s ETHA experienced outflows of nearly $25 million, highlighting the diverse investor activity within the Ethereum ETF space. The “Other ETFs” category indicates that some ETF providers experienced neither inflows nor outflows on this particular day. Why Are Crypto ETFs Gaining Traction? The increasing interest in Crypto ETF products, including Ethereum ETFs, reflects a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets. ETFs offer several compelling benefits that attract both institutional and retail investors: Accessibility: ETFs provide a familiar and regulated investment vehicle to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the digital assets. This simplifies the process for many investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges and wallets. Diversification: ETFs can offer diversification within a crypto portfolio and across broader investment portfolios. Liquidity: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling during market hours. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within established regulatory frameworks, providing a layer of security and investor protection compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies, which are often subject to less regulatory oversight. Navigating the Future of Ethereum ETF Inflows: What to Watch For? While the $15.86 million inflow is undoubtedly encouraging, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. Sustained positive ETF inflows will be a key indicator of growing institutional and retail adoption of Ethereum as an investment asset. Here are some key aspects to monitor moving forward: Daily Inflow Trends: Track daily inflows and outflows across various Ethereum ETFs to identify emerging trends and shifts in investor sentiment. Market Sentiment: Monitor overall market sentiment towards Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Positive sentiment is likely to drive further inflows. Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on regulatory developments surrounding crypto ETFs and the broader crypto space, as these can significantly impact investor confidence and market dynamics. Ethereum Network Upgrades: Progress and successful implementation of Ethereum network upgrades, like the Dencun upgrade, can boost investor confidence and attract further investment. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Ethereum ETFs? The $15.86 million net inflow into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on March 4th is a welcome sign, breaking a chain of consecutive outflows. Fidelity and Grayscale led the charge, demonstrating continued investor appetite for these investment products. While BlackRock experienced outflows, the overall picture points towards renewed interest in Ethereum ETFs. Whether this marks the beginning of a sustained inflow trend remains to be seen, but it certainly injects a dose of optimism into the market and underscores the evolving landscape of crypto investments.

On March 5, the FIU revealed a number of strategies to prevent money laundering at the AML Inspection Trustee Council, according to local media Wow TV . The FIU plans to launch a joint response team to handle AML crimes that threaten public livelihoods, in collaboration with the Financial Supervisory Service and financial institutions. The team will be tasked with monitoring transactions and analyzing suspicious transaction patterns linked to voice phishing, multi-level fraud, gambling, and drug-related financial crimes. The joint response team will operate bi-monthly under the FIU to present reports regarding recent AML-linked activities. In addition, authorities will issue warnings to certain industry players selected based on vulnerability towards AML crimes, media reports and industry requests. According to the report, the FIU vows to actively review new types of money laundering methods, including the use of crypto trading accounts and the misuse of remittance services to facilitate money laundering.

In addition, the Financial Supervisory Service said that it would expand their monitoring reach to include finance firms which have recently been investigated for suspicious AML activity. They will also set their sights on companies previously flagged for weak AML management in prior assessments. According to the Korean Customs Service, inspections have been conducted on up to 77 companies, which included high-risk money exchange offices as well as online and automated money exchanges last year. The investigation revealed 45 companies were guilty of violations such as failing to report suspiciously large transactions. The FSS also announced it plans to evaluate the cooperation between consumer protection department and AML departments in South Korean firms to boost their ability to detect and prevent financial crimes from happening. On Feb. 28, the South Korean government upgraded a temporary task force into a formal joint investigation unit that specifically deals with crypto-related crimes and fraud cases. The unit was formed due to the increasing number of crypto crimes in South Korea in recent years.

With the rise of sophisticated financial crimes, particularly those involving the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector, the nation’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is taking proactive steps. This initiative signals a robust commitment to ensuring the integrity of South Korea’s financial markets in the face of evolving digital threats. Are you prepared for the sweeping changes in crypto regulation? Decoding South Korea’s Strengthened AML System The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), operating under the Financial Services Commission (FSC), recently convened a crucial consultation meeting on March 5th. This meeting served as a platform to discuss and refine AML examination processes and to communicate planned examination schedules to relevant agencies. The core objective is clear: to build a more resilient and adaptive South Korea AML system capable of effectively countering emerging money laundering techniques. This proactive approach underscores South Korea’s determination to stay ahead of financial criminals who exploit technological advancements. Here’s a breakdown of what this enhanced AML system aims to achieve: Enhanced Monitoring of Virtual Accounts: With the increasing use of virtual accounts in cryptocurrency transactions, the FIU is focusing on tightening surveillance to detect and prevent illicit activities. Streamlined Transfer Scrutiny: The system will implement more rigorous checks on streamlined transfer methods, which can be exploited for money laundering. Proactive Response to Novel Methods: The FIU is committed to continuously updating its strategies to address new and evolving money laundering techniques as they emerge in the financial landscape. Inter-Agency Collaboration: By sharing examination plans and fostering consultation, the FIU is promoting better coordination among various agencies involved in combating financial crime. Why is Cryptocurrency Regulation a Top Priority? The surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies has brought immense opportunities, but it has also opened new avenues for financial crimes . The decentralized and often pseudonymous nature of crypto transactions can make them attractive for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. Recognizing this inherent risk, global financial authorities are increasingly focusing on cryptocurrency regulation to strike a balance between fostering innovation and preventing criminal exploitation. South Korea, a nation with one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency adoption, is particularly vulnerable. The FIU’s initiative to bolster the AML system is a direct response to the escalating threat of crypto-related financial offenses. By strengthening its regulatory framework, South Korea aims to: Protect Investors: Robust AML measures can help safeguard investors from scams and fraudulent schemes prevalent in the crypto space. Maintain Financial Stability: Preventing money laundering and illicit financial flows is crucial for the overall stability of the national financial system. Enhance International Compliance: Strengthening AML systems aligns South Korea with international standards and best practices in combating financial crime, fostering global cooperation. Promote Responsible Innovation: Clear and effective regulation can foster a more trustworthy and sustainable environment for legitimate cryptocurrency businesses and innovation to thrive. Challenges in Combating Modern Financial Crimes Combating modern financial crimes , especially in the digital age, presents a complex set of challenges. Criminals are constantly innovating, employing sophisticated techniques to evade detection. The speed and borderless nature of cryptocurrency transactions further complicate matters. For the South Korea AML system and others globally, key challenges include: Challenge Description Evolving Typologies Money laundering methods are constantly evolving, requiring continuous adaptation of AML systems. Technological Complexity Understanding and effectively regulating complex technologies like blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) is crucial. Cross-Border Transactions The global nature of cryptocurrencies necessitates international cooperation and harmonization of regulations. Resource Constraints Developing and maintaining cutting-edge AML systems requires significant investment in technology and expertise. Examples of Crypto-Related Financial Crimes To understand the urgency behind strengthening the South Korea AML system , it’s important to consider real-world examples of cryptocurrency regulation failures and subsequent financial crimes: Ransomware Attacks: Cybercriminals often demand ransom payments in cryptocurrencies, which can be difficult to trace and recover. Darknet Marketplaces: Illegal goods and services are frequently traded on darknet marketplaces using cryptocurrencies for anonymous transactions. Investment Scams: Numerous crypto investment scams and Ponzi schemes have defrauded investors of significant sums. Money Laundering through Exchanges: Criminals may use cryptocurrency exchanges to launder illicit funds by converting them into digital assets and then back into fiat currency. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users and Businesses? The усиление (strengthening) of the South Korea AML system has implications for both cryptocurrency users and businesses operating within the nation. Here’s what you need to know: Increased Scrutiny: Expect enhanced scrutiny of cryptocurrency transactions, particularly those involving virtual accounts and large transfers. KYC/AML Compliance: Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers will face stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML compliance requirements. Transparency and Reporting: There will be a greater emphasis on transparency and reporting of suspicious transactions to the FIU. Potential for Delays: Increased scrutiny might lead to potential delays in transaction processing as exchanges and institutions implement stricter compliance measures. For businesses in the crypto space, proactive compliance is key. This includes implementing robust KYC/AML procedures, monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, and staying informed about evolving regulatory requirements. For individual users, understanding and adhering to these regulations will ensure smooth and compliant participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion: A Proactive Stance Against Crypto Crime South Korea’s commitment to bolstering its AML system is a significant step in the ongoing battle against financial crime in the digital age. By proactively addressing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies and virtual assets, the nation is not only protecting its financial system but also setting a benchmark for other countries grappling with similar challenges. This move signals a clear message: as the world of finance evolves, so too must the mechanisms designed to safeguard its integrity. The 강화 (reinforcement) of the South Korea AML system is a testament to this crucial adaptation.

This revelation, broadcast live by The Telegraph, suggests a significant shift in the ongoing geopolitical tensions, with Ukraine signaling its readiness for Ukraine negotiation . Why is Zelenskyy’s Letter on Ukraine Negotiation a Potential Game Changer? President Trump’s announcement that Ukraine is “ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring peace that lasts” is a pivotal development. But what does this mean for the world, and specifically for the cryptocurrency market? Let’s break down the key aspects: De-escalation Signals: A willingness to negotiate often signals a desire to de-escalate conflict. Reduced geopolitical risk can positively influence investor sentiment across various markets, including crypto. Economic Stability: Negotiations aimed at peace can lead to greater economic stability in the region. Stability is generally favorable for market growth and reduces uncertainty, which is often detrimental to investment. Global Market Impact: The conflict in Ukraine has had far-reaching global economic consequences. Progress towards peace talks could ease inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, indirectly benefiting the crypto market alongside traditional markets. The unveiling of the Zelenskyy letter at Trump Congress address is not just a political maneuver; it’s a potential catalyst for change. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this news warrants close attention. The cryptocurrency market, known for its sensitivity to global events, could react swiftly to any tangible progress in Ukraine negotiation . Trump Congress Address and the Geopolitical Crypto Impact Trump’s decision to share the Zelenskyy letter in Congress amplifies the message and brings it to a wider audience. This move can be interpreted in several ways: Increased Pressure for Dialogue: By publicly stating Ukraine’s readiness to negotiate, Trump might be aiming to increase international pressure on all parties to engage in constructive dialogue. Shifting Political Landscape: The announcement could indicate a shift in the political approach towards the conflict, potentially opening new avenues for resolution. Market Volatility – Opportunity or Risk? Initial reactions in the crypto market might be volatile. However, sustained positive momentum in peace talks could present a long-term opportunity for growth as risk appetite returns to the market. Understanding the geopolitical crypto impact is crucial. Cryptocurrency, while decentralized, is not immune to global events. Large-scale conflicts and resolutions significantly influence investor behavior and market sentiment. A move towards peace in Ukraine could be perceived as a positive signal, potentially leading to increased investment in risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Crypto Peace Talks: A Silver Lining? While the term “ crypto peace talks ” might seem unconventional, the underlying principle is relevant. Cryptocurrency markets often reflect global sentiment. Progress in diplomatic efforts, like the potential Ukraine negotiation , can foster a more optimistic outlook, indirectly benefiting the crypto space. Consider these potential benefits: Benefit Description Crypto Market Relevance Reduced Uncertainty Peace talks reduce the uncertainty associated with prolonged conflict. Investors are more likely to invest in crypto when uncertainty decreases. Improved Investor Sentiment Positive news about peace talks can improve overall market sentiment. Positive sentiment often translates to increased crypto buying activity. Economic Recovery Eventual peace can lead to economic recovery in affected regions and globally. A stronger global economy is generally beneficial for all markets, including crypto. However, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges: Negotiation Complexity: Peace negotiations are complex and can be protracted. Setbacks are possible, which could trigger market volatility. Uncertainty Remains: Even with negotiations, the outcome is not guaranteed. Geopolitical risks can resurface quickly. Market Overreaction: The crypto market can sometimes overreact to news, both positively and negatively. 冷静 and informed decision-making is essential. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do in light of this development? Stay Informed: Closely monitor news related to Ukraine negotiation and geopolitical developments. Reliable news sources are crucial. Manage Risk: Geopolitical events can cause market swings. Ensure your portfolio is diversified and risk-managed. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your crypto investments. Short-term volatility driven by news events can sometimes be ignored if your long-term thesis remains intact. Consider Dips as Opportunities: Market dips caused by uncertainty can sometimes present buying opportunities for long-term investors, but only after careful research and due diligence. Conclusion: Hope on the Horizon? Trump’s disclosure of the Zelenskyy letter and Ukraine’s stated readiness for Ukraine negotiation injects a dose of hope into a tense global landscape. While the path to peace is undoubtedly complex and uncertain, this development offers a glimmer of optimism. For the cryptocurrency market, which is intricately linked to global events, this could be a significant turning point. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and prepared for potential volatility, but also recognize the potential for positive shifts if these initial steps towards negotiation translate into meaningful progress.

Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin rose by over 16% amidst high volatility. During this period, the top LINK wallets were found to have increased holdings to 18.15% of supply. LINK Surges After Market Dip Chainlink (LINK) has shown a notable rebound following a market-wide downturn, recovering from a low of $13.18 on Tuesday to reach $15.42, according to Santiment’s latest update . In the following hours, LINK even surpassed the $16 mark. The analytics firm observed that the asset is currently experiencing “abnormally” high trading volume and volatility. Additionally, Santiment pointed to the top five LINK wallet holders, whose stashes continue to grow and now account for 18.15% of the total supply, worth approximately $2.93 billion. This accumulation trend among major holders suggests continued confidence in the asset despite recent market turbulence. This aligns with LINK recently recording the highest whale activity in 14 months. However, the movement of 2.23 million LINK tokens to crypto exchanges over the last two weeks risks derailing the bullish momentum as such actions suggest increased selling pressure or potential market activity. When large amounts of cryptocurrency are transferred to exchanges, it often indicates that holders may be preparing to sell, which can lead to downward price pressure. LINK Among Top Contenders for US Strategic Reserve Inclusion Meanwhile, LINK has also been identified as a potential candidate for inclusion in the US strategic reserve, according to CryptoRank’s latest tweet . While Trump has hinted at the inclusion of certain cryptocurrencies like XRP and ADA, he has also mentioned “other valuable cryptocurrencies,” leaving room for speculation about LINK’s potential inclusion. As such, CryptoRank sees LINK, alongside Litecoin (LTC), Polkadot (DOT), and Hedera (HBAR), as a more viable option than meme coins such as Official Trump (TRUMP), Official Melania (MELANIA), Bonk (BONK), and even Dogecoin (DOGE). Additionally, Chainlink has also been leading the development activity in the real-world assets (RWA) sector. The decentralized oracle network was found to have surpassed rivals like Ethereum-based synthetic asset platform Synthetix (SNX), and privacy and tokenization-focused Dusk Foundation (DUSK), among others.

( HUT ) : at the time of writing it was trading at around $8 per share and it closed the year at exactly my target price disclosed in the article's comments section ($20). For this year as well, I am reiterating my bullish case on Hut 8 with a $30 price target on the stock, currently trading at $15 per share at the time of writing. Fundamentals have changed - and for the better. Last year my bet on Hut 8 was primarily based on the bitcoin halving weakening competition and making BTC more scarce and expensive: indeed, Hut 8 was (and still is) the largest bitcoin holder among crypto miners after MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ). Now my bullish thesis has somewhat changed as we moved away from the halving event and the segment has adapted to the new BTC rewards for mining. I noticed in the most recent earnings of Hut 8 an interesting shift in the business model: its strategic orientation. Hut 8 doesn’t generate revenue only from Bitcoin anymore. It also makes money from AI, data center, power generation, etc. Therefore I see Hut 8 as a great way to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s upside, while minimizing the downside risks. Bitcoin’s maximum downside is $0 (its price is completely driven by supply and demand, causing volatility) while Hut 8 is backed by real assets and cash flows that extend beyond crypto, thus making long-term growth possible even in case of crypto bear markets. Data by YCharts Business Overview The company, headquartered in Miami, Florida, has a portfolio comprising twenty different sites: ten Bitcoin mining sites in Alberta, Canada, New York, and Texas, five computing data centers in British Columbia and Ontario, Canada, four power generation assets in Ontario, Canada, and one new site that will open in Texas. Hut 8 The diversification of this digital infrastructure across geographies and technological segments gives an edge to Hut 8 in relation to its crypto mining peers that are primarily focused on Bitcoin mining. The rapid ramp-up of operations in the past years caused the company to grow in a somewhat unstructured way. The halving of Bitcoin mining rewards forced the company to turn more efficient. Its recent shutdown of the Drumheller site (a cost center) and the relocation from hosted to owned facilities led to 30% savings in energy cost per MWH. The organisational restructuring (optimisation of headcount and new hires) led to an increase in the gross margin per BTC from 46% to 54% gross margin Y/Y. But there are more takeaways from the 24Q4 earnings report, released March 3, 2025 and available on Seeking Alpha . Earnings The earnings relative to 2024 Q4 showed solid growth. Hut 8 had a profit of $152.2 mn, compared with $10.6 mn of profit in the same quarter a year ago. The company announced an impressive gain on digital assets of $308.2 mn as cryptocurrencies rallied in the last quarter of 2024. Bitcoin in particular had an impressive run until mid-December, supporting the company’s revenue. Despite the improvement in the profitability, the quarterly revenue did decline to $31.7 mn from $38.9 mn in the year-ago quarter due to the lesser amount of BTC mined after the halving. Analysts had expected $38.4 million, so it came as a negative surprise. Interestingly, the CEO Asher Genoot opened the door to AI: ""we believe we are well-positioned to meet the continued and rising demand for energy capacity from applications like AI"", showing the determination to diversify away from Bitcoin. Hut 8 Although the fourth quarter showed some volatility, the earnings on an annual basis were impressive and proved the company is on a path of high growth. On a Y/Y basis, revenue increased by 69% from $96 mn to $162 mn, adjusted EBITDA from $86 mn to $556 mn (547% increase), net income multiplied by 15x from $22 mn to $331 mn and the company’s strategic BTC reserve increased from 9,195 BTC to 10,171 (worth approximately $900 mn at the time of writing). These impressive earnings improved the state of the balance sheet. Balance Sheet Hut 8 did accumulate a significant amount of debt (typical of high growth cash burners), with current liabilities matching current assets ($110 mn each). It is typical of high growth businesses to reinvest the maximum available liquidity. Still, the amount of cash in hand ($72.3 mn) plus total assets ($1.1 bn) by far surpassing total liabilities ($387 mn) provide sufficient comfort to shareholders. Hut 8 Hut 8’s focus is to retain as many bitcoins as it can. This led to an 11% increase in BTC holdings totalling 10,171 BTC, at current price worth roughly $900 mn. The BTC holdings are part of the company’s strategic reserve: Hut 8 can sell some when the business’ expansion plans require liquidity and they are usually used as collateral to the company’s long-term debt. In addition to retaining BTC, the company reduced debt by converting Anchorage Digital’s $37.9 mn loan to equity and increased liquidity access by the inclusion into the Russell 3000. The inclusion in this index is part of the institutionalisation of the stock: the institutional ownership of Hut 8 increased from 12% at the end of Q1 2024 to 55% by 2024 year-end. An increased presence of institutional investors usually means more capital but also more stability to the stock price. Their investments could further increase as the regulatory framework continues being altered in favor of the crypto segment. Valuation The good standing of the balance sheet combined with the cheap valuation causes the stock to trade at an attractive P/B of 1.43x. The recently announced solid earnings combined with the recent Bitcoin price correction cause the stock to be trading cheap, if not extremely cheap. Indeed, the markets have yet to reprice the stock at a more appropriate valuation. The current P/E (GAAP) stands at a mere 4.14x on a TTM basis. This is fairly cheap in relation to the sector which has many players with negative or low earnings (sector median valuation stands at 28x earnings). Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ) is currently trading at a TTM P/E of 27x and CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) is trading at 29x. A stock with this high growth profile should conservatively trade at least double of its current valuation, to continue trading in line with last year’s valuation of 7-8x P/E. This would set the price target at approximately double of today’s stock price, without considering the potential accelerated earnings growth trajectory of the next years. My price target for this year is therefore $30, up from last year’s $20 per share and the current $15 per share. The current cheap valuation possibly shows skepticism from the markets that Hut 8 won’t reiterate strong earnings in the next quarters, but Bitcoin’s recent all-time high and current tailwinds, combined with the diversification of the business should support Hut 8’s continued growth. Still, I have decided to exclude further earnings expansion in the price target to account for unpredictable price swings of Bitcoin. Growth Catalysts: One Internal and Another External The first growth catalyst is internal: it’s the diversification of the business. Indeed, the revenue of the company is divided in several streams that all support growth. The largest and primary one is the Compute segment (bitcoin mining, data center cloud and GPU-as-a-service) generating a revenue stream of $80.7 mn, representing a 24% Y/Y increase. But the other smaller revenue streams are the fastest growing ones. Power Generation facilities supplying capacity and energy directly to the electrical grid generated $56.6 mn - more than double of previous year’s $22.8 mn. The Digital Infrastructure (BTC and CPU colocation) also more than doubled generating $17.5 mn (up from $8.3 mn). A brand new revenue stream that virtually didn’t generate any revenue has already generated $7.4 mn in 2024: sales of Bitcoin mining equipment. Hut 8 is currently also launching a repair and maintenance segment that should generate more consequent revenue in 2025 as well. Equipment Sales and Repair (Hut 8) A second growth catalyst is directly linked to the primary revenue stream segment (Bitcoin mining): the US President Donald Trump announced on March 2nd, 2025, the creation of a US national crypto reserve that would include BTC and a handful of other US-based cryptocurrencies. This should significantly support the demand for cryptocurrencies, including BTC, and continue to reward Hut 8’s BTC mining but also potentially boost the value of the company’s own strategic BTC reserve. The crypto reserve is subject to the approval from Congress where the Republican party currently holds the majority. Risk Factors To My Case The key risk is the dependence to the volatile Bitcoin price which is fully based on supply and demand. Both the balance sheet and the cash flows are highly dependent on the value of the BTC mined by Hut 8. When the price of the crypto corrects by 30% like it did, the assets side of the balance sheet is strongly affected. The key mitigant here is the diversification of the business of Hut 8. Alternative revenue streams beyond Bitcoin mining have shown strong growth potential and have already generated significant revenue in 2025. I believe that over time these alternative revenue streams will support, improve and diversify the assets side of the balance sheet. Another key risk is in case the crypto reserve proposed by Trump does not pass in the Congress, the price of Bitcoin could be severely impacted and consequently Hut 8’s earnings and balance sheet as well. Bottom Line Bottom line: the stock is an excellent way to gain exposure to the upside potential of BTC amidst a number of favorable cryptocurrency tailwinds in the US, while hedging possible downside. The diversification and cautious strategic orientations of the management team are showing that the business can make money in other segments while using the same sites and infrastructures in the US and in Canada. The stock is currently trading at a significant discount and has impressive growth potential. While the diversification is underway, the dependency of the stock price to Bitcoin’s price doesn’t convince me to rate it a “Strong Buy” yet. For this reason, I am rating the stock a “Buy” once again, as I did last year.",RIOT|CLSK|MARA|HUT|HUT:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MINING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-05 11:40:46

However, the meme coin has since entered a sharp correction as interest in meme coins fades and macroeconomic factors including tariffs, weigh on risk assets. With DOGE struggling to regain momentum, traders are now questioning: Will Dogecoin price hit its peak again in 2025? DOGE price today trades at $0.203 after a 5% gain in 24 hours. Dogecoin Price in Focus Amid Potential Adoption and Institutional Interest Dogecoin price last reached its all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021. The surge at the time was driven largely by Elon Musk endorsements and social media hype. If Musk were to revive Dogecoin’s popularity with a major move like integrating DOGE payments on X, the meme coin could replicate its 2021 rally. Recent speculation suggests Musk might explore DOGE payments. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has teased his interest in helping Musk integrate DOGE payments and suggested that the Dogecoin blockchain can be improved to power the Grok 3 AI model. If this were to happen, Dogecoin price could hit its peak of $0.73 in 2025. Another catalyst that could drive gains for Dogecoin price is institutional interest. In late January, Grayscale launched the Dogecoin Trust , which pushed Dogecoin’s legitimacy in traditional finance. This product already has $1.8M in assets under management. Grayscale Dogecoin Trust Additionally, the SEC has until October 2025 to decide on Grayscale’s application for a spot Dogecoin ETF . If approved, this ETF could fuel a bullish Dogecoin price prediction and potentially fuel a rally to its all-time high. DOGE Price Analysis – Will DOGE Hit an ATH in 2025? Dogecoin has a bullish outlook on its weekly chart after forming a cup and handle pattern. This pattern indicates a potential breakout to the upside. If the momentum in the broader market were to shift and the Dogecoin price resumes its bullish trajectory, it needs to flip resistance at $0.28. Doing so would trigger a rally to resistance at $0.54, which could place Dogecoin on the path toward its peak level of $0.73. The Awesome Oscillator is falling, showing that the bearish momentum is growing weak, which may trigger a bullish price reversal. The ADX is also tipping south, suggesting that the bearish momentum in the cup’s handle is weakening, which may spark a reversal to the upside. DOGE/USDT: 1-week Chart This bullish technical outlook and catalysts such as institutional adoption and potential DOGE payments on X may lead to Dogecoin price reaching its peak in 2025. However, for DOGE to make a rally to a record high in the near term, there needs to be a surge in buying activity.

But this digital transformation comes with a significant environmental footprint, primarily from the energy-hungry data centers that power AI applications. Enter EcoDataCenter, a Swedish pioneer championing sustainability in this crucial infrastructure sector. They’ve just secured a massive $478 million funding boost to build more green data centers , perfectly timed as their major client, AI powerhouse CoreWeave, gears up for a US IPO. Is this a turning point towards a more eco-conscious AI future? Let’s dive into how EcoDataCenter is making waves and why this investment matters. Why the Rush for Sustainable Data Centers? The need for sustainable data centers is no longer a niche concern—it’s becoming a critical imperative. Traditional data centers, essential for processing the vast amounts of data AI algorithms require, consume staggering amounts of electricity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) paints a stark picture: Large data centers can demand 100 MW of power or more. Their annual electricity consumption can equal that of 350,000 to 400,000 electric cars. Collectively, data centers account for approximately 1% of global electricity consumption. This escalating energy consumption raises serious environmental alarms. As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for data center capacity will only intensify, making the shift towards green data centers absolutely essential. Companies and investors are increasingly recognizing the urgency and potential of sustainable solutions in this space. EcoDataCenter: Leading the Charge in Green AI Infrastructure EcoDataCenter isn’t just building data centers; they are architecting a more sustainable future for AI. Their core mission is to provide colocation spaces that minimize environmental impact while meeting the growing demands of compute-intensive industries. Here’s what sets them apart: Pioneering Cross-Laminated Timber: EcoDataCenter was the first globally to utilize cross-laminated timber in data center construction, a sustainable alternative now being adopted by tech giants like Microsoft. Renewable Energy Focus: They power their facilities with renewable energy sources, significantly reducing their carbon footprint. Continuous Innovation: EcoDataCenter is committed to developing and implementing cutting-edge technologies and materials for enhanced cooling and operational efficiency. CEO Peter Michelson emphasizes their proactive approach: “We were the first company in the world to start building in what’s called cross-laminated timber. Now, Microsoft is following.” This leadership in sustainable practices is not just environmentally responsible; it’s also becoming a competitive advantage in the burgeoning AI infrastructure market. The $478 Million Investment: Fueling Expansion and Innovation The recent $478 million equity funding round underscores the market’s confidence in EcoDataCenter’s vision and execution. This substantial capital injection will be instrumental in: Scaling Operations: Expanding their capacity to meet the surging demand for sustainable data center solutions. Technology Development: Investing further in research and development to create even more efficient and environmentally friendly data center technologies. Building New Facilities: Constructing state-of-the-art green data centers to support the expansion of AI and high-performance computing. This funding brings EcoDataCenter’s total equity raised to an impressive €910 million ($966 million). While parent company Areim remains tight-lipped about valuation and IPO plans, the focus is clearly on growth and long-term value creation. Robert Björk of Areim stated, “We are focused on scaling EcoDataCenter and delivering long-term value, supported by the strong backing of our investors.” CoreWeave and the AI Colocation Boom EcoDataCenter’s partnership with CoreWeave, a leading AI compute provider, highlights the strategic importance of colocation in the AI ecosystem. CoreWeave, along with other major players like DeepL and hyperscalers, rely on colocation facilities to: Manage Compute Demands: Handle the massive computational workloads of AI applications. Balance Capacity: Supplement their own data centers and ensure flexible scalability. Reduce Capex: Avoid massive upfront capital expenditure by leveraging third-party infrastructure. EcoDataCenter is also at the forefront of a groundbreaking project with CoreWeave and Nvidia to establish Europe’s first Blackwell cluster in Falun, Sweden. This initiative aims to bring cutting-edge compute capabilities to Europe, further solidifying EcoDataCenter’s role in the global AI infrastructure landscape. Data Center Investment: Riding the AI Hype Wave The substantial funding secured by EcoDataCenter reflects a broader trend: massive data center investment driven by the AI boom. The scale of this investment is exemplified by initiatives like the U.S.’s ambitious $500 billion “Stargate” project, aimed at building mega AI data centers. While details of Stargate are still emerging, it underscores the global race to build out the infrastructure needed to support the AI revolution. Peter Michelson notes the influx of capital: “There’s a lot of infrastructure-type capital flooding into the data center space, given that it’s real estate infrastructure now becoming more tech oriented.” This convergence of real estate and technology is attracting significant investment, positioning data centers as a highly attractive asset class in the AI era. The Future is Green and Intelligent EcoDataCenter’s latest funding round is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful signal that sustainable data centers are not just a desirable option but a necessary evolution in the age of AI. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, the infrastructure powering it must align with environmental responsibility. EcoDataCenter is proving that it’s possible to meet the insatiable demand for compute while minimizing environmental impact, setting a new standard for the industry and inspiring others to follow suit.

41187283,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137040,1741175258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Dollar Plunge: Trade Jitters Trigger Euro Stimulus Surge in Forex Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-falls-trade-jitters-euro-stimulus/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, understanding the movements in traditional financial markets, especially the Forex market, is crucial. Why? Because shifts in major currencies like the Dollar and Euro can ripple through the entire financial ecosystem, influencing everything from crypto trading pairs to broader investment strategies. Today, we’re diving deep into a significant development: the Dollar’s recent dip amidst ongoing trade jitters and the Euro’s surprising climb fueled by stimulus discussions. Buckle up as we unravel what’s happening and what it means for you. Why is the Dollar Under Pressure Amid Trade Jitters? The mighty US Dollar, often seen as a safe haven in times of global uncertainty, is currently facing headwinds. What’s causing this pressure? It boils down to trade jitters . But what exactly are trade jitters? Global Economic Uncertainty: Lingering concerns about global economic growth, especially in major economies, are making investors nervous. This nervousness translates to a flight from perceived riskier assets, but also impacts currencies like the Dollar which are heavily influenced by global trade flows. Trade Tensions: Ongoing trade disputes and uncertainties, particularly between major economic powers, are casting a shadow over the Dollar. When trade relationships are strained, it creates doubt about future economic stability, weakening the Dollar’s appeal. Reduced Demand for Dollar-Denominated Assets: As trade outlook becomes uncertain, there’s a potential decrease in demand for Dollar-denominated assets. This reduced demand can lead to a depreciation in the Dollar’s value against other currencies. Think of it like this: if the world economy is a ship sailing through rough seas (trade jitters), investors might be less inclined to hold onto the currency of the ship’s captain (Dollar), seeking potentially calmer waters elsewhere. Euro’s Surprising Strength: The Power of Stimulus Talks While the Dollar is facing turbulence, the Euro is showing remarkable resilience and even strength. What’s the secret behind the Euro’s upward trajectory? The answer lies in stimulus talks . Anticipation of Economic Boost: Discussions around potential stimulus measures in the Eurozone are injecting optimism into the market. Stimulus packages, designed to boost economic activity, can make a currency more attractive to investors. ECB and Government Actions: Talks of stimulus often involve actions from the European Central Bank (ECB) and individual Eurozone governments. These actions can range from monetary policy adjustments to fiscal spending, all aimed at stimulating growth. Increased Investor Confidence: Stimulus talks signal a proactive approach to economic challenges. This can boost investor confidence in the Eurozone economy and, consequently, in the Euro itself. Imagine the Eurozone economy as a plant that needs nourishment. Stimulus talks are like the promise of water and fertilizer, giving investors hope for growth and making the Euro a potentially fertile ground for investment. Decoding the Forex Market Dynamics The interplay between the Dollar and Euro, influenced by trade jitters and stimulus talks, is playing out in the dynamic Forex market . But what exactly does this mean for traders and investors? Factor Impact on Dollar Impact on Euro Trade Jitters Downward Pressure (Weakening) Relatively Less Impact (Potential Safe Haven Flows) Stimulus Talks Limited Direct Impact Upward Pressure (Strengthening) Overall Forex Market Sentiment Bearish (Negative Outlook) Bullish (Positive Outlook) In essence, the Forex market is currently reflecting a narrative where the Dollar is losing ground due to global economic uncertainties and trade tensions, while the Euro is gaining momentum on the back of anticipated stimulus measures. This creates trading opportunities and challenges alike. Navigating Trade Jitters and Stimulus: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, how can you, as a crypto enthusiast or trader, navigate these trade jitters and stimulus -driven Forex market shifts? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Forex Trends: Keep a close eye on Dollar and Euro movements. These traditional currency fluctuations can often precede or mirror trends in the crypto market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including both crypto and traditional currencies, can help mitigate risk during volatile times. Understand Macroeconomic Factors: Develop a basic understanding of macroeconomic factors like trade balances, interest rates, and stimulus packages. These factors can significantly impact both Forex and crypto markets. Stay Informed on Global News: Global news events, especially those related to trade and economic policy, can trigger market reactions. Stay updated on these developments to anticipate potential market movements. Consider Forex-Crypto Correlations: Explore potential correlations between Forex pairs (like EUR/USD) and crypto assets. While not always direct, understanding these relationships can provide valuable trading signals. Remember, knowledge is power in the volatile world of financial markets. By understanding the forces driving the Dollar and Euro , you can make more informed decisions in your crypto journey. The Future of Forex: Dollar vs. Euro and Beyond Looking ahead, the Forex market landscape remains dynamic. Will the Dollar continue its descent, or will it find a footing? Will the Euro’s stimulus-fueled rally persist? Several factors will shape the future trajectory: Resolution of Trade Disputes: Any progress in resolving global trade tensions could potentially ease pressure on the Dollar and influence the Forex market . Effectiveness of Stimulus Measures: The actual implementation and effectiveness of Eurozone stimulus packages will be crucial in determining the Euro’s strength. Central Bank Policies: Monetary policy decisions from the Federal Reserve (US) and the ECB will continue to play a significant role in currency valuations. Geopolitical Events: Unforeseen geopolitical events can always introduce volatility and shift currency flows in unpredictable ways. In conclusion, the current Dollar weakness amidst trade jitters and the Euro’s strength driven by stimulus talks present a fascinating case study in global Forex market dynamics. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding these shifts is not just academic; it’s a practical necessity for navigating the interconnected world of finance. By staying informed and adaptable, you can better position yourself to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks in both the traditional and digital asset landscapes.

The President also criticized the country for issuing subsidies to foreign chipmakers like Samsung Electronics Co. The country’s currency weakened against the dollar to about 1,460 won, though Samsung shares remained largely unchanged. Trump also argued that Samsung was a major recipient of subsidies under the Chip Act for building a plant in Texas. The President urged the Speaker to get rid of the Chip Act and redirect the funds to reduce the country’s debt . Trump puts a spotlight on South Korean ‘higher-than-China’ tariffs Trump accuses South Korea of imposing higher tariffs on American products than China. South Korea says its tariff on manufactured US goods is zero. https://t.co/qq3iDkSFuF — Sam Kim (@samkimreports) March 5, 2025 Donald Trump has pointed to South Korea for imposing higher tariffs against American products than China. He argued that the country imposed tariffs four times higher than those of China. “China’s average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them, and South Korea’s average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher, and we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea, but that’s what happens. This is happening by friend or foe.” – U.S. President Donald Trump . Trump’s comments hinted concerns for policymakers and businesses in South Korea as he might eventually turn his attention to trade and security relations with Seoul. The country’s currency briefly plummeted against the dollar to around 1,460 won after Trump mentioned South Korea’s tariffs, before paring losses. The South Korean government has dismissed Trump’s claims that its tariff rate is four times higher. The government has said that the effective rate on imports from the U.S. under the Korea-U.S. FTA was 0.79% as of 2024. The 47th President of the U.S. also noted that Mexico and other states have trade surpluses with the United States that impose duties on American products. He maintained the high level of unfairness he felt toward South Korea, which supplies the U.S. with everything from automobiles to semiconductors. The country highlighted last month that its tariffs on manufactured goods from the U.S. are effectively zero under a free trade agreement that took effect in 2012. The state also applies hefty tariffs on some agricultural goods, such as rice. Bloomberg Economics estimated that imposing U.S. tariffs could reduce South Korea’s gross domestic product by 0.8% this year. The firm also found that the impact of U.S. tariffs on South Korea’s GDP will be concentrated in the second half. South Korean officials were in Washington last week, where they urged the country’s longtime ally to exempt Seoul from Trump’s planned tariffs. The nation argued that it relies heavily on trade for economic growth, with its largest firms generating the bulk of their revenues overseas. The officials also highlighted that the latest tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada will impact South Korea indirectly by dwindling demand for items that eventually end up in the U.S. South Korea expects more issues with Trump’s administration The country also acknowledged that it could face more issues with Trump’s administration, such as security relations. South Korea highlighted that it depends on security guarantees from Washington to deter North Korean aggression. The U.S. president referred to its ally as a “money machine” last year as he demanded that South Korea shoulder more of the upkeep for American troops stationed on the Korean Peninsula. Trump also critiqued the Chips and Science Act introduced under the Biden administration and called it a “horrible, horrible thing.” He refrained from mentioning Samsung, the country’s builder of memory chips that is a major recipient of subsidies under the act for a plant it’s constructing in Texas. His comments rekindled concerns that the project may be halted for foreign manufacturers setting up operations in the U.S. The U.S. president believes that “they will come because they won’t have to pay tariffs if they build in America.” He also urged the Speaker not to get rid of the Chip Act but instead use it to reduce debt or “any other reason you want to.” Bloomberg Economics believes that the U.S. tariffs and the uncertainty that comes with them could limit exports and output from South Korea. The news outlet said the threat of new U.S. tariffs could curb exports and output due to delayed decisions by South Korea’s exporters and reduced U.S. demand or imports. Trump also made other comments about South Korea and noted that it was among nations that wanted to partner in a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. The United States has advertised the project’s promise to Asian policymakers, such as Japan’s prime minister and South Korea’s trade minister.

A recent report has dropped a bombshell in the DeFi world, particularly for those keeping an eye on projects with political connections. On-chain analytics are revealing some eye-watering figures related to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi venture reportedly backed by the Trump family. Are these crypto losses a sign of trouble, or just another day in the volatile world of digital assets? Let’s dive into the details and uncover what’s happening. Shocking WLFI Unrealized Losses: A Deep Dive into the Numbers According to the eagle-eyed on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is currently sitting on a staggering $87.83 million in WLFI unrealized losses from its cryptocurrency portfolio. That’s a hefty sum, even in the often dramatic crypto market. What’s driving these losses, and which cryptocurrencies are taking the biggest hit? Here’s a breakdown of the key figures: Total Unrealized Losses: $87.83 million Largest Contributor: Ethereum (ETH) – $67.02 million Recent Activity: No additions to crypto holdings in the last 13 days The dominance of Ethereum in these losses is particularly noteworthy. Why is ETH contributing such a significant portion of the crypto losses ? Let’s explore the potential factors. Ethereum Holdings Under Scrutiny: Why is ETH Taking the Brunt? With a whopping $67.02 million in Ethereum holdings contributing to the total unrealized losses, it’s natural to ask: why Ethereum? Several factors could be at play: Market Volatility: Ethereum, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to significant price swings. Recent market corrections could have impacted ETH’s value, leading to these unrealized losses. Size of ETH Holdings: It’s possible that WLFI holds a substantial amount of Ethereum in its portfolio. Larger holdings mean larger potential losses (and gains) when the market moves. Timing of Purchase: If WLFI acquired their Ethereum holdings at a higher price point, the current market downturn would naturally result in unrealized losses. DeFi Strategies: WLFI being a DeFi project might be employing certain strategies involving Ethereum that are currently underperforming due to market conditions. It’s crucial to remember that these are unrealized losses. This means that WLFI hasn’t actually sold these assets at a loss. The losses are based on the current market value compared to the purchase price. However, such significant unrealized losses can still be concerning and impact investor sentiment. Trump Crypto Project and Market Perception: Does Political Affiliation Play a Role? The connection to the Trump family adds another layer of intrigue to this story. The term “ Trump crypto project ” immediately brings political dimensions into the equation. Does this affiliation influence market perception and investor behavior towards WLFI? Here are some potential considerations: Polarizing Figure: Donald Trump is a highly polarizing figure. This could mean that WLFI attracts both strong supporters and detractors based solely on this association. Political Sentiment: Political sentiment can sometimes spill over into investment decisions. Positive or negative views towards the Trump brand might influence how people perceive and invest in WLFI. Media Scrutiny: Projects linked to prominent political figures often face heightened media scrutiny. This report on unrealized losses is a prime example of the increased attention WLFI is likely to receive. It’s important to separate political opinions from financial analysis. However, in the real world, these factors can be intertwined and influence market dynamics. Navigating DeFi Market Risk: Lessons from WLFI’s Unrealized Losses WLFI’s situation highlights the inherent DeFi market risk that exists within the decentralized finance space. While DeFi offers exciting opportunities, it also comes with its own set of challenges and risks. What can we learn from this situation? Key takeaways regarding DeFi market risks: Risk Factor Description Relevance to WLFI Volatility Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile, leading to rapid fluctuations in asset values. Directly contributes to the unrealized losses experienced by WLFI, particularly in Ethereum. Market Downturns Broader market corrections or bear markets can significantly impact the value of crypto holdings across the board. Likely a major factor in the current unrealized losses if WLFI’s holdings were acquired before a recent market dip. Project-Specific Risks DeFi projects can face unique risks related to their technology, tokenomics, and operational execution. While not explicitly detailed in the report, project-specific factors within WLFI could also contribute to their financial performance. Transparency & Audits The level of transparency and security audits for a DeFi project can influence investor confidence and risk assessment. Further investigation into WLFI’s transparency and audit history would be beneficial for a comprehensive risk analysis. For investors in DeFi, this serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of due diligence, risk management, and understanding the volatile nature of the crypto market. Unrealized losses, while not actual losses until assets are sold, can still be a significant indicator of portfolio performance and potential future challenges. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Do? So, what are the actionable takeaways for crypto investors in light of this WLFI news? Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio across different assets to mitigate risk. Understand Project Fundamentals: Before investing in any DeFi project, thoroughly research its fundamentals, team, technology, and tokenomics. Risk Management: Implement proper risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and only investing what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, on-chain analytics, and developments related to your investments. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto markets are cyclical. Focus on long-term potential and avoid panic selling during market downturns. The WLFI situation is a stark reminder that even projects with high-profile backing are not immune to the inherent risks of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the need for vigilance, informed decision-making, and a realistic understanding of both the potential rewards and the potential pitfalls of investing in digital assets. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for DeFi and Crypto Investors The report of $87.83 million in unrealized crypto losses at Trump-backed WLFI is more than just a headline. It’s a wake-up call for the DeFi sector and the broader crypto investment community. It highlights the volatile nature of the market, the significant impact of Ethereum holdings on portfolio performance, and the ever-present DeFi market risk . Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or a newcomer to the space, understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets. The story of WLFI and its WLFI unrealized losses serves as a valuable case study in the ongoing evolution of the crypto landscape, reminding us all to proceed with caution and informed optimism.

41187402,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137037,1741175507,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive Coinbase Merger Rumors: Wall Street & Crypto Worlds Collide?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-merger-securities-exchange/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with electrifying speculation! Could a monumental merger be on the cards, one that could reshape the very landscape of digital finance? Whispers from Wall Street, amplified by a recent Barron’s report, suggest a potential seismic shift: a merger between crypto giant Coinbase and a major U.S. securities exchange. This comes hot on the heels of President Trump’s surprising announcement about the U.S. strategically stockpiling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, SOL, and ADA. But what does this all mean, and could this seemingly audacious idea actually materialize? Why a Coinbase Merger is Gaining Traction? The notion of a Coinbase merger with a traditional financial powerhouse might seem like a radical concept at first glance. However, several factors are fueling this speculation and making it appear increasingly plausible. Let’s break down the key drivers: Trump’s Crypto Endorsement & Strategic Stockpile: President Trump’s recent declaration about the U.S. strategically stockpiling leading cryptocurrencies has sent shockwaves through both the crypto and traditional finance sectors. This signals a significant shift in the U.S. government’s stance towards digital assets, potentially paving the way for greater integration with established financial systems. Regulatory Clarity (or the Need for It): The cryptocurrency industry has long grappled with regulatory ambiguity. A merger with a regulated securities exchange could offer a pathway to navigate the complex regulatory landscape more effectively. By combining Coinbase’s crypto expertise with the regulatory framework of a securities exchange, the merged entity could potentially gain a stronger foothold and legitimacy in the eyes of regulators and institutional investors. Synergies and Market Dominance: A merger would create an entity with unparalleled reach and capabilities. Coinbase brings its massive user base, crypto technology, and brand recognition. A major securities exchange offers established infrastructure, regulatory compliance expertise, and access to traditional financial markets. This synergy could lead to market dominance and accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Institutional Investor Appetite: Institutional investors are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to digital assets. However, they often seek regulated and familiar platforms. A merged entity could provide the institutional-grade infrastructure and compliance they require, unlocking significant capital flows into the crypto market. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE): The Frontrunner for a Crypto Exchange Alliance? Barron’s report specifically highlights Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), as a leading contender for a crypto exchange merger with Coinbase. Why ICE? Let’s examine the rationale: ICE’s Previous Foray into Crypto: ICE is not a newcomer to the digital asset space. They launched Bakkt, a digital asset platform offering physically-settled Bitcoin futures, indicating their existing interest and understanding of the crypto market. This prior experience makes them a more natural fit compared to other securities exchanges. NYSE’s Brand and Infrastructure: The New York Stock Exchange, under the ICE umbrella, is synonymous with financial credibility and robust infrastructure. Partnering with Coinbase could allow ICE to leverage its established brand and technological capabilities to rapidly expand its presence in the burgeoning crypto market. Diversification Strategy: For ICE, a merger represents a strategic diversification move. As traditional financial markets evolve and digital assets gain prominence, integrating with a leading crypto platform like Coinbase can future-proof their business and tap into new growth opportunities. Potential for Innovation: The combination of ICE’s traditional market expertise and Coinbase’s crypto-native innovation could spark a wave of new financial products and services, bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. What are the Potential Benefits of a Securities Exchange and Crypto Firm Union? The potential advantages of a securities exchange merging with a crypto giant like Coinbase are multifaceted and could be transformative for the financial industry. Here’s a closer look at the potential benefits: Benefit Description Enhanced Regulatory Compliance Operating under the regulatory umbrella of a securities exchange would provide Coinbase with a clearer and potentially more favorable regulatory environment, reducing uncertainty and fostering trust. Increased Institutional Adoption A merger could accelerate institutional investment in crypto by providing a regulated and familiar platform, addressing concerns around custody, security, and compliance. Expanded Product Offerings The combined entity could offer a wider range of financial products and services, blending traditional securities with digital assets, catering to a broader investor base. Improved Market Liquidity Integrating the liquidity of traditional markets with the crypto market could lead to deeper and more efficient markets for digital assets. Technological Innovation The merger could foster innovation by combining the technological prowess of Coinbase with the established infrastructure and resources of a securities exchange. Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Regulation and Merger Integration While the prospect of a Coinbase merger is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges and hurdles that would need to be overcome. These include: Regulatory Scrutiny: Mergers of this magnitude would undoubtedly face intense regulatory scrutiny from agencies like the SEC and potentially antitrust authorities. Navigating these approvals could be a lengthy and complex process. Integration Complexities: Integrating two vastly different corporate cultures, technologies, and operational models would be a significant undertaking. Ensuring a smooth and efficient integration process is crucial for the merger’s success. Valuation Discrepancies: Determining a fair valuation for both Coinbase and the securities exchange could be challenging given the volatile nature of the crypto market and differing valuation methodologies between traditional and crypto companies. Market Volatility and Risk Management: The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market presents risk management challenges for traditional securities exchanges. Effective risk management strategies would be paramount for a merged entity. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The rumors of a potential digital assets merger between Coinbase and a major U.S. securities exchange are more than just market gossip. They represent a potential paradigm shift in how digital assets are integrated into the mainstream financial system. For crypto investors, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and developments related to this potential merger and regulatory updates concerning cryptocurrencies. Consider Long-Term Implications: A successful merger could signal increased legitimacy and institutional adoption of crypto, potentially driving long-term growth for the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the news is positive, remember the crypto market remains volatile. Diversification remains a key strategy for managing risk. Evaluate Coinbase (COIN) Stock: If you’re interested in publicly traded crypto exposure, monitor Coinbase’s stock performance as merger rumors evolve, but conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Crypto? The speculation surrounding a potential Coinbase merger with a major U.S. securities exchange marks a potentially transformative moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Fueled by regulatory tailwinds and the growing appetite for digital assets from both retail and institutional investors, this bold move could bridge the gap between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning crypto economy. While challenges remain, the potential rewards – enhanced legitimacy, increased adoption, and groundbreaking innovation – are immense. The coming months will be crucial in determining if these explosive rumors solidify into a market-altering reality. One thing is certain: the conversation around crypto and its integration into mainstream finance is rapidly evolving, and this potential merger could be a pivotal catalyst in that evolution.

Ethereum fell below $2,000 yesterday for the first time since November 2023. However, it bounced back above $2,000 today, closing at $2,170 amid a broader market recovery. Although ETH has recovered and is trading above $2,200, the massive sell-off continues. According to Arkham data, a wallet address that received 114,500 ETH worth $358 million from the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Genesis sold 40,000 ETH in two days. The whale that received the most Ethereum compensation from Genesis sold 40,000 ETH worth $89.9 million via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions in the last two days. Ethereum at Bear Market Levels! According to CryptoQuant data, the rate of unrealized profits among Ethereum whales has fallen to levels not seen since the previous bear market. Stating that Ethereum is currently going through a difficult period, CryptoQuant analyst noted that the ETH/BTC ratio is in a continuous downtrend amid increasing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. According to the analyst, the whale's profitability rate has fallen to bear market levels, meaning that most of its positions are back to the same profit level as during the bear market, despite a price twice as high today. “The proportion of unrealized profits among ETH whales has fallen to levels not seen since the previous bear market. Ethereum is currently going through a difficult period. “In particular, the whale group holding between 1K and 10K Ethereum has even returned to a negative unrealized profit margin.

For those tracking the ebb and flow of global finance, the EUR/USD pair remains a critical barometer. Today, we delve into the near-term outlook for EUR/USD, as shared by financial giant ING, against the backdrop of an intensifying global trade war. What does this mean for currency exchange rates and your financial strategy? Let’s explore the insightful forecast. Decoding the EUR/USD Forecast Amidst Trade War Escalation The EUR/USD pair, representing the exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar, is the most heavily traded currency pair globally. Its movements are influenced by a myriad of factors, from economic data releases and central bank policies to geopolitical events. Currently, the escalating trade war adds a significant layer of complexity. ING’s recent analysis provides a crucial EUR/USD Forecast , offering a near-term perspective that traders and market watchers need to consider. But what exactly is driving ING’s outlook? It’s essential to understand the key elements shaping their perspective: Trade War Dynamics: The intensification of trade disputes between major economies, particularly the US and others, injects volatility into currency markets. Increased tariffs and retaliatory measures can disrupt global supply chains and impact economic growth, influencing currency valuations. Economic Data Divergence: The relative economic performance of the Eurozone and the United States plays a vital role. Any significant divergence in economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation, and employment figures, can sway the EUR/USD pair. Central Bank Policies: The monetary policies of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) are key determinants. Interest rate differentials and signals about future policy directions directly affect currency attractiveness. Geopolitical Risks: Beyond trade, broader geopolitical uncertainties can also weigh on market sentiment and currency flows, creating headwinds or tailwinds for the EUR/USD. Understanding the Trade War Impact on Currency Exchange Rates Trade wars are not just about tariffs and trade deficits; they have profound implications for Currency Exchange Rates . When trade tensions escalate, investors often seek safe-haven assets, which can impact currency valuations. Let’s break down how a trade war intensifies and how it influences the EUR/USD: Increased Uncertainty: Trade wars breed economic uncertainty. Businesses delay investment decisions, and consumers may become hesitant to spend. This uncertainty can weaken currencies linked to economies heavily involved in the trade disputes. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs and trade barriers disrupt established global supply chains. Companies may face higher costs, leading to reduced profitability and potentially slower economic growth. This can negatively impact a currency’s strength. Currency Manipulation Concerns: In a trade war environment, there’s often heightened scrutiny and accusations of currency manipulation. Countries might be tempted to devalue their currencies to gain a competitive advantage, adding further volatility to the Forex market. Safe-Haven Flows: Amidst trade war turmoil, currencies perceived as safe havens, like the US Dollar at times, might experience increased demand. This can strengthen the dollar against other currencies, including the Euro. Consider this scenario: If the US imposes new tariffs on European goods, and the EU retaliates, both economies could face headwinds. However, the perceived impact might differ, leading to shifts in the EUR/USD. ING’s analysis likely considers these intricate dynamics to arrive at their forecast. ING’s Realistic Euro US Dollar Outlook: What to Expect Near-Term? While precise forecasts are inherently challenging, especially in volatile times, ING’s Euro US Dollar Outlook offers valuable insights. Based on their analysis, several scenarios could play out in the near term: Scenario Key Drivers Potential EUR/USD Impact Base Case: Managed Trade Tensions Trade talks progress without major escalations; economic data remains moderately supportive for both regions. EUR/USD trades within a defined range, potentially with slight upward bias if Eurozone data improves relatively more. Upside Scenario: Trade War De-escalation Significant easing of trade tensions; positive global growth momentum returns. EUR/USD could see a more pronounced upward movement as risk appetite increases and potentially weakens the safe-haven appeal of the USD. Downside Scenario: Trade War Intensification Further escalation of trade disputes; global economic slowdown fears heighten. EUR/USD could face downward pressure as the USD strengthens on safe-haven demand, and concerns about Eurozone growth weigh on the Euro. It’s crucial to remember that these are scenarios, not definitive predictions. ING’s outlook likely emphasizes a data-dependent approach, meaning their view can evolve as new economic information and trade war developments emerge. Staying informed and adaptable is key for navigating the Forex market in this environment. Forex Market Analysis: Key Factors Beyond the Trade War While the trade war is a dominant theme, a comprehensive Forex Market Analysis of EUR/USD requires considering other critical factors. These elements can either amplify or mitigate the trade war’s impact: ECB and Fed Policy Divergence: Any shift in the perceived policy stance of the ECB and the Fed can trigger significant EUR/USD movements. For instance, if the Fed signals a more hawkish stance (more likely to raise interest rates) than the ECB, it could strengthen the USD against the Euro. Eurozone Economic Health: The overall health of the Eurozone economy, including growth, inflation, and employment, is paramount. Stronger Eurozone data can support the Euro, while weaker data can weigh it down. US Economic Performance: Similarly, the strength of the US economy is crucial for the Dollar’s trajectory. Robust US economic data typically supports the USD. Political Stability and Risk Events: Political developments in both the Eurozone and the US, as well as unexpected global risk events, can inject volatility into the EUR/USD pair. Traders and investors need to monitor these factors closely alongside trade war headlines to gain a holistic understanding of the forces shaping the EUR/USD. Navigating Currency Exchange Rates in Uncertain Times: Actionable Insights So, how can you navigate these uncertain times in the Currency Exchange Rates market, particularly concerning EUR/USD? While direct financial advice is beyond the scope here, consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest trade war developments, economic data releases from both the Eurozone and the US, and central bank announcements. Reliable financial news sources are essential. Diversify Your Approach: Don’t rely solely on one currency pair or one market view. Diversification can help mitigate risks in volatile times. Manage Risk Prudently: Employ appropriate risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, to protect your capital in potentially turbulent market conditions. Understand Scenario Planning: Consider different scenarios, like those outlined by ING, and think about how each scenario might impact your financial positions. Consult Professionals: If you’re unsure or need personalized advice, consult with a qualified financial advisor who can help you navigate the complexities of the Forex market. The Forex market, especially the EUR/USD pair, is a dynamic arena influenced by a complex interplay of factors. The intensifying trade war adds another layer of intricacy. By staying informed, understanding the key drivers, and adopting a prudent approach, you can better navigate the opportunities and challenges that the Forex market presents in these uncertain times. In conclusion, ING’s near-term outlook for EUR/USD, viewed through the lens of an escalating trade war, highlights the inherent uncertainties and potential volatility in the Forex market. While pinpointing the exact future path of EUR/USD remains elusive, understanding the key drivers – trade dynamics, economic data, and central bank policies – is crucial for anyone involved in or observing the currency markets. The insight offered by institutions like ING provides a valuable framework for navigating these complex times and making informed decisions in the world of currency exchange.

DXY Drop Signals 2017-Style Surge,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-bull-run-ahead-dxy-drop-signals-2017-style-surge/,"The post Bitcoin Bull Run Ahead? DXY Drop Signals 2017-Style Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the last three days, the US Dollar Index, or DXY, which measures the US dollar’s value against a basket of six major currencies, has dropped from above 107 to around 105. Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has showcased an impressive surge of 7.7%. There are reasons to assume that the present pattern may replicate a 2017 pattern – in which a drop in the value of the DXY index from 103 to 90 caused a massive bull run in the BTC market. Is a BTC bull run coming? DXY Mirrors Trump’s First Term Pattern Between late September 2024 and early January 2025, the value of the DXY index surged steeply from 100 to 110. However, since mid-January 2025, it has sharply plummeted from 110 to 105. The DXY index measures the US dollar’s value against a basket of six major currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. If any of these currencies strengthen against the dollar, the value of the DXY decreases. This means that in the last three months, the US dollar has shown weakness against some of these currencies. At the start of this year, one Euro was equivalent to 1.03551 Us dollar. Now, the value of a Euro is $1.06981 – at least 3.31% higher than at the beginning of the year. This implies that the Euro has gained strength against the US dollar since the start of the year 2025. Experts opine that the latest pattern, observed in the DXY index, looks similar to the pattern formed during the first term of US President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President . Bitcoin’s Price Responds to DXY Movements The relationship between the DXY index and the crypto market is complex, but there are some general trends to observe. Historically, there has often been an inverse correlation between the DXY and the price of Bitcoin. In 2017, when the DXY index slipped from 103 to 90, a massive bull run was triggered in the BTC market. Importantly, a decrease in the DXY suggests that investors are more willing to take on risk. The global tariff war, initiated by the US, targeting major global economies – specifically Canada, Mexico and China – has affected the macroeconomic environment of the US. Certain major indexes are expected to face the heat of this economic uncertainty. In January, the US unemployment rate dropped from 4.1% to 4%. The consensus is that in February it will remain unchanged at 4% Some investors view BTC as a hedge against inflation.

This upgrade brings key improvements for validators, wallets, and layer-2 scaling. Developers can now test these features before they go live on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade In Progress Ethereum developers have been working on Pectra for months, and its activation on Holesky at epoch 115,968 marks a crucial step. The Sepolia testnet already adopted the upgrade at epoch 222,464 on March 5 . Now, with both test networks testing the changes, Ethereum developers are expected to decide on a mainnet launch date soon. Meanwhile, Pectra follows the Dencun upgrade, which was released in March 2024 and helped lower transaction fees for layer-2 networks. Unlike Dencun, which focused on reducing costs, Pectra introduced new features to make Ethereum accounts more efficient and improve staking. Key Features of Pectra Upgrade Pectra is one of Ethereum’s biggest upgrades since 2024, bringing 11 major improvements known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Among them, two stand out: EIP-7251: This proposal increases the maximum staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, allowing large validators to manage their stakes more efficiently. EIP-7702: This feature allows wallets to temporarily act as smart contracts, enabling users to pay gas fees with stablecoins, set up automatic payments, and recover wallets without needing seed phrases. With these changes, Ethereum aims to provide a smoother experience for both validators and everyday users. Ethereum Drop Below $2K Could Trigger $700M Liquidation! While the Pectra upgrade promises major improvements, but its price remains stuck in consolidation. A breakout could happen if a strong rally occurs during the March 7 Crypto Summit , followed by a dip that forms a solid bottom. For Ethereum to gain momentum, it needs to retest the $2,600 and $2,700 resistance levels and then face a pullback after the event. If ETH drops into the $1,600–$1,700 demand zone, it could trigger a buying opportunity, especially with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing oversold levels. Meanwhile, data from CoinGlass shows that a 2.6% dip below $2,154 would trigger $298 million in long liquidations. A bigger drop below $2,107 and $2,049 could wipe out $582 million and $705 million in positions. Overall, an 8% decline could lead to liquidations exceeding $700 million, adding more pressure to ETH’s price.",News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 11:58:49

In the broader outlook, the price will likely consolidate within the $2K- $2.5K range until a breakout signals the next major move. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum has recently faced a sharp decline, plunging nearly 30% to reach the critical $2K support level. This drop followed a rejection at the 200-day moving average near $2.9K and was aggravated by market uncertainty triggered by President Trump’s tariff war announcement. The fear-driven sell-off has left Ethereum in a volatile state, but the $2K region has provided significant support, aligning with key ICT OTE levels. For now, consolidation between the $2K and $2.5K range is expected as market participants wait for a breakout to dictate the next major move. If buyers fail to defend the $2K level in the coming weeks, further declines toward the $1.5K mark could become likely. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, ETH recently attempted a bullish retracement but encountered strong selling pressure at the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, leading to another sharp downturn. Upon revisiting the $2K support, which aligns with a critical sell-side liquidity zone, a temporary bounce occurred due to significant buying interest. However, this rebound was short-lived, and Ethereum once again faced a wave of sell-offs, pushing it back toward the $2K level. This turbulent price action suggests heightened trading activity and notable liquidations in the perpetual markets, with nearly $980 billion being flushed out within 24 hours. Given these conditions, Ethereum is expected to remain volatile, consolidating within the $2K-$2.5K range in the mid-term, with further liquidations potentially shaping the market’s next major move. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Ethereum recently experienced a sharp market downturn, triggering the largest liquidation cascade in years. This wave of liquidations wiped out numerous leveraged positions, as seen in the chart, leading to heightened volatility. Despite the severe drop, Ethereum found strong support at the critical $2K level, signaling potential stabilization. With leverage significantly reduced, the perpetual markets have cooled down, creating an opportunity for a market reset. This shift could allow for fresh supply and demand dynamics as cautious traders re-enter at key price levels. If Ethereum sustains its position above $2K and begins to build momentum, the current consolidation phase may evolve into a new bullish wave. Key resistance levels to watch are $2.5K and $3K. While short-term consolidation is expected, a sustained uptrend will depend on increased spot market demand, driving prices higher.

In the meantime, Bitcoin rebounds and reclaims levels above $90,000, flashing bullish signals for the upcoming price action. The lesser clarity on the crypto strategic reserve was speculated to have raised concerns, which has kept the price resitructed within a range. However, in a big announcement, the tables have turned for the BTC price rally, which is expected to remain elevated and reach $95,000 soon. Ever since Donald Trump announced the creation of a crypto strategic reserve with the top cryptos like BTC, ETH, XRP, and ADA, the traders have become bullish on these cryptos. However, the President is about to take a step further and reveal the Bitcoin strategic reserve in the first ever crypto summit hosted by the White House. Soon after this, Bitcoin locked in its higher low and charged towards the range lows again. Now, all eyes lie on reclaiming a pivotal resistance, which may make things better once that’s done. The short-term price action of Bitcoin suggests the price has rebounded from the local lows and is believed to rise and reach the local highs. The stochastic RSI has rebounded from the lows and is heading towards the upper threshold. Besides, the conversion line of the Ichimoku cloud has triggered a bullish divergence, which suggests the price may continue to rise and reach the interim resistance at $91,320. In the meantime, the bears have begun to exert significant pressure over the token, but the bulls appear to have held a tight grip over the rally. As a result, the BTC price is expected to keep up the momentum until Friday. However, after Donald Trump’s announcement on the Bitcoin strategic reserve, the price is expected to witness a huge bullish push, which could keep up the bullish trend and regain the lost levels.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 11:59:10

Recent news from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) brings a significant update on MiCA compliance and its impact on stablecoins. If you’ve been concerned about the future of non-compliant stablecoins under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), this clarification might offer some relief, but also warrants careful consideration. Let’s dive into what ESMA’s announcement means for you and the broader crypto landscape in Europe. Decoding ESMA’s Bold Stance on MiCA and Stablecoin Custody The burning question on everyone’s mind is: What exactly did ESMA clarify? According to a Cointelegraph report, ESMA stated that MiCA doesn’t explicitly prohibit the custody and transfer of stablecoins that don’t fully comply with MiCA’s stringent requirements. This is a crucial point because initial interpretations of MiCA had created uncertainty about the fate of these digital assets. But before you breathe a sigh of relief, there’s a vital caveat. While custody and transfers aren’t outright banned, ESMA advises European crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to exercise caution. Specifically, they should limit services that facilitate the acquisition of non-MiCA compliant stablecoins . This subtle but significant distinction is where the devil lies in the details. Let’s break down what this means: Custody and Transfer Allowed (With Caveats): Holding and moving non-compliant stablecoins isn’t against the rules, according to ESMA’s recent statement. This provides a degree of operational freedom for users and platforms dealing with these assets. Acquisition Services Discouraged: CASPs are urged to limit services that make it easy to buy or obtain these stablecoins. This suggests a strategic move to gradually reduce the inflow and circulation of non-compliant stablecoins within the European Economic Area (EEA). Navigating Nuances: The regulation isn’t a blanket ban, but rather a steer towards compliance. It appears to be a transitional approach, allowing time for the market to adapt while discouraging further expansion of non-compliant assets. Binance’s Proactive Move: Delisting Non-Compliant Stablecoins Even before ESMA’s clarification, major players in the crypto exchange space were already taking steps to align with the upcoming MiCA framework. A prime example is Binance. Binance Exchange previously announced its plan to delist nine non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) starting March 31. Notably, this list reportedly includes USDT, a dominant stablecoin in the global crypto market. However, Binance’s approach also mirrors ESMA’s nuanced stance. While delisting for trading purposes, Binance will continue to permit deposits and withdrawals of these stablecoins. This action highlights a proactive effort to comply with the spirit of crypto regulation in Europe while still providing essential services to users. Let’s examine Binance’s actions in more detail: Action Details Implications Delisting for Trading Binance will remove trading pairs for nine non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins in EEA. Users in EEA won’t be able to directly trade these stablecoins on Binance. Deposits and Withdrawals Allowed Users can still deposit and withdraw these stablecoins from their Binance accounts. Ensures users retain access to their assets and can move them as needed. Starting Date Changes effective from March 31st. Users need to be aware of the timeline and adjust their strategies accordingly. Why is MiCA Compliance and Stablecoin Regulation Crucial? Understanding the ‘why’ behind these regulations is as important as knowing the ‘what’. MiCA, and regulations like it globally, aim to bring greater stability, transparency, and consumer protection to the burgeoning crypto market. When it comes to stablecoins, the stakes are particularly high because they are often touted as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. Here’s why crypto regulation focusing on stablecoins is essential: Financial Stability: Stablecoins, if not properly regulated, could pose risks to financial stability, especially if they achieve widespread adoption. MiCA seeks to mitigate these risks by setting standards for issuers and operations. Consumer Protection: Regulations are designed to protect users from potential scams, market manipulation, and the risks associated with opaque or poorly managed stablecoin projects. Market Integrity: Clear rules foster a more level playing field, encourage innovation within a responsible framework, and enhance the overall integrity of the crypto market. Combating Illicit Activities: Regulatory oversight helps in preventing the use of stablecoins for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Stablecoins in Europe So, what should you do with this information? Whether you are a crypto user, a CASP, or simply an observer of the crypto space, here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed on MiCA Developments: The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Keep abreast of further clarifications and implementations of MiCA. ESMA’s guidance is a step, but more details will likely emerge. For CASPs: Review and Adapt Services: If you are a crypto service provider in Europe, assess your services related to non-compliant stablecoins. Consider how to align with ESMA’s guidance to limit acquisition services while ensuring continued essential functionalities like custody and withdrawals where permitted. For Users: Understand the Implications for Your Holdings: If you hold non-compliant stablecoins, understand how exchanges like Binance are adapting. Be prepared for potential changes in trading availability and explore compliant alternatives as they emerge. Explore Compliant Stablecoin Options: As MiCA implementation progresses, expect to see a greater emphasis on compliant stablecoins. Familiarize yourself with these options and understand their benefits in a regulated environment. The Future of Stablecoins and Crypto Regulation in Europe ESMA’s clarification offers a crucial glimpse into the practical application of MiCA, particularly concerning stablecoins. It suggests a pragmatic approach – not an immediate crackdown, but a gradual and guided transition towards compliance. The message is clear: while non-compliant stablecoins aren’t being outright banished from Europe just yet, the regulatory direction is firmly set towards fostering a compliant and safer crypto ecosystem. The coming months will be critical in observing how these guidelines are implemented and how the crypto market adapts to this evolving European market landscape. This nuanced approach from ESMA signals a mature understanding of the complexities of the crypto market. It aims to balance innovation with necessary safeguards, ensuring that Europe remains a significant player in the global digital asset revolution while prioritizing user protection and market integrity. The journey of stablecoin custody and usage in Europe is unfolding, and staying informed is your best strategy to navigate it successfully.

41187867,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136956,1741176335,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Welcomed Victory: Senate Overturns Controversial IRS DeFi Broker Reporting Rule,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/senate-overturns-irs-defi-rule/,"In a significant win for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the U.S. Senate has voted to overturn a contentious IRS rule that broadened the definition of “brokers” for tax reporting purposes. This move, celebrated by the cryptocurrency industry, signals a potential shift in how digital assets are regulated in the United States. Let’s dive into what this Senate vote means for DeFi and the future of cryptocurrency taxation. What’s the Buzz About the IRS Crypto Rule and DeFi Broker Reporting? Imagine you’re navigating the exciting world of DeFi, engaging in lending, borrowing, or yield farming. Suddenly, a new IRS rule pops up, potentially classifying many participants in this decentralized ecosystem as “brokers.” This would mean increased reporting requirements, adding complexity and potentially stifling innovation. The rule, introduced in December, aimed to clarify tax obligations within the digital asset space, but it cast a wide net, encompassing various DeFi actors who might not traditionally be considered brokers. The core issue revolved around the expanded definition of a “broker.” The IRS rule sought to include entities that facilitate digital asset transfers, potentially capturing: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Platforms that enable peer-to-peer crypto trading. DeFi Protocol Developers: Those who create and maintain the smart contracts underpinning DeFi services. Wallet Providers: Services that allow users to store and manage their cryptocurrencies. This broad definition sparked immediate concerns within the crypto community. Industry advocates argued that it was impractical and technically infeasible for many DeFi participants to comply with traditional broker reporting requirements. The Blockchain Association, a prominent industry group, voiced strong opposition, emphasizing the rule’s potential to harm the burgeoning DeFi sector. Senate DeFi Vote: A Decisive Step Towards Clarity Enter the U.S. Senate, wielding the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and potentially overturn new agency rules. In a powerful bipartisan move, the Senate voted 70-27 to invalidate the IRS’s expanded definition of “brokers” in the context of DeFi broker reporting . This decisive Senate DeFi vote represents a significant pushback against what many perceived as regulatory overreach. Key highlights of the Senate vote: Bipartisan Support: The 70-27 vote demonstrates significant agreement across party lines regarding concerns about the IRS rule. Congressional Review Act: This act provided the mechanism for the Senate to directly challenge and potentially overturn the IRS regulation. Industry Advocacy: Groups like the Blockchain Association played a crucial role in lobbying for congressional action, highlighting the rule’s potential negative impacts. What Happens Next with the IRS Crypto Rule? While the Senate vote is a major victory, the journey isn’t over yet. For the resolution to take full effect and officially overturn the IRS crypto rule , the House of Representatives must also pass a similar resolution. The crypto industry is now focused on advocating for a favorable vote in the House. If the House concurs, the IRS rule will be effectively nullified, preventing its implementation. Here’s a breakdown of the remaining steps: Step Description Outcome Senate Vote Senate passes resolution to overturn IRS rule. Completed House Vote House of Representatives votes on a matching resolution. ? Pending – Requires House approval for final overturn. Presidential Signature (Likely Unnecessary) If both houses pass the resolution, it typically doesn’t require presidential signature under the Congressional Review Act to overturn the rule. ? Likely not required Why This Matters: Benefits and Implications of Overturning the IRS Rule Overturning the IRS rule on cryptocurrency tax reporting for DeFi brokers carries several significant benefits for the crypto ecosystem: Fosters Innovation: A less burdensome regulatory environment can encourage continued innovation and growth within the DeFi space. Reduces Compliance Costs: Avoiding overly broad broker definitions can save DeFi participants from complex and costly compliance requirements. Protects Decentralization: Preventing the classification of decentralized protocols as brokers helps maintain the core principles of decentralization in DeFi. Provides Regulatory Clarity: While this specific rule is overturned, it opens the door for more nuanced and industry-informed regulatory discussions regarding digital assets. Challenges Ahead in DeFi Regulation Despite this victory, the broader challenges of DeFi regulation remain. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to appropriately regulate the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Key challenges include: Defining Regulatory Boundaries: Determining which DeFi activities fall under existing financial regulations and where new frameworks are needed. Balancing Innovation and Investor Protection: Creating regulations that protect consumers and investors without stifling technological advancement.

41187960,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137014,1741176499,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Boosted Security: Meta’s Facial Recognition AI Arrives in UK to Combat Fraud,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-facial-recognition-uk-expansion/,"In a significant move to bolster user security and tackle online deception, tech giant Meta is rolling out its anti-fraud facial recognition technology in the United Kingdom. This expansion comes hot on the heels of a regulatory nod, signaling a crucial step forward in Meta’s approach to combating scams and enhancing account protection. For cryptocurrency users and investors who are often targets of sophisticated online fraud, this development promises a more secure digital environment within Meta’s platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Let’s dive into what this means for you. Why is Meta Expanding Facial Recognition to the UK? Meta’s decision to bring its facial recognition tools to the UK is primarily driven by the escalating issue of online scams, particularly those leveraging deepfakes and impersonations of public figures. These scams, often promising lucrative but bogus cryptocurrency investments, have plagued social media platforms, causing significant financial losses to unsuspecting users. The expansion addresses two key areas: Combating Celebrity Impersonation Scams: Scammers frequently use deepfakes or manipulated images of celebrities to endorse fake products or investment schemes, including dubious crypto ventures. Meta’s facial recognition technology is designed to identify and flag these fraudulent ads, offering an additional layer of fraud prevention . Account Recovery and Security: The second tool aims to simplify account recovery for users locked out of their Facebook or Instagram profiles. By using facial recognition for verification, Meta provides a more streamlined and secure method for users to regain access to their accounts, reducing reliance on potentially compromised traditional methods. Initially tested internationally last October, these tools have now received the green light from UK regulators, paving the way for their implementation in a key market. This regulatory approval underscores the growing acceptance and, indeed, encouragement of AI-driven solutions to combat online harms. How Does Meta’s Facial Recognition Technology Work for Fraud Prevention? Meta’s facial recognition system operates in a privacy-conscious manner, focusing specifically on the outlined purposes of scam detection and account verification. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality: Opt-In and User Control: For public figures, the fraud prevention feature is optional. Celebrities and influencers in the UK will receive in-app notifications allowing them to opt-in for “celeb-bait protection.” This ensures user consent and control over the use of their biometric data. Targeted Scam Detection: The technology is deployed to identify ads that misuse the likenesses of public figures to promote scams. This is particularly relevant in the cryptocurrency space, where celebrity endorsements (often fake) are used to lure investors into fraudulent schemes. Data Privacy Commitment: Meta emphasizes that facial data collected for this purpose is used solely for one-time comparison and is immediately deleted, regardless of whether a match is found. This commitment to data privacy is crucial, especially given past controversies surrounding facial recognition technologies. Video Selfie Verification: For account recovery, the “video selfie verification” tool offers an alternative to traditional password resets. Users can verify their identity by submitting a video selfie, which is then analyzed using facial recognition to confirm their identity and restore account access. What are the Benefits of this AI Rollout in the UK? The introduction of Meta’s facial recognition tools in the UK brings several potential benefits, particularly for users concerned about online security and fraud : Enhanced Security: By proactively identifying and removing scam ads, especially those related to cryptocurrency and investments, Meta offers a safer online environment for users in the UK . Faster Account Recovery: The video selfie verification provides a quicker and potentially more secure method for users to regain access to their accounts compared to traditional methods that can be cumbersome and vulnerable to social engineering. Regulatory Compliance and Trust: Receiving a “thumbs up” from UK regulators demonstrates Meta’s commitment to operating within legal frameworks and addressing concerns around AI and biometric data. This can help rebuild trust with users and regulators alike. Combating Misinformation: While initially focused on financial scams, the technology lays the groundwork for broader applications in combating misinformation and deepfakes across various domains. Are There Challenges and Concerns? Despite the potential benefits, the deployment of facial recognition technology, even for anti-fraud purposes, is not without its challenges and potential concerns: Privacy Considerations: Even with Meta’s assurances of data deletion and limited use, any deployment of facial recognition technology raises privacy concerns. Public scrutiny and ongoing monitoring are essential to ensure compliance and prevent misuse. Accuracy and Bias: Facial recognition systems can sometimes exhibit biases based on demographics. Continuous testing and refinement are necessary to ensure fairness and accuracy across all user groups. Scope Creep Potential: While currently limited to specific anti-fraud and account recovery functions, there’s always a risk of expanding the use of facial recognition to other areas in the future. Transparency and clear communication from Meta are vital to manage these concerns. User Adoption and Awareness: The effectiveness of these tools depends on user adoption, particularly for the opt-in celeb-bait protection. Meta needs to ensure effective communication and user education to maximize uptake and impact. Meta’s Broader AI Strategy and Facial Recognition This move is part of Meta’s broader strategic pivot towards AI . The company is heavily investing in AI across its products and even exploring standalone AI applications. This renewed focus on AI comes after years of grappling with the controversies surrounding facial recognition . Meta’s history with this technology is complex: Timeline Event 2021 Meta shuts down its decade-old facial recognition tool for photos on Facebook due to regulatory and legal challenges. 2022 Meta agrees to a substantial $1.4 billion settlement in a Texas lawsuit over biometric data collection related to facial recognition technology. Present Meta reintroduces facial recognition in a limited and privacy-focused manner for anti- fraud and account security, starting with tests and now expanding to the UK . Despite past setbacks, Meta retained its DeepFace model, signaling a long-term interest in leveraging facial recognition capabilities. The current rollout in the UK appears to be a calculated step to re-engage with this technology in a more responsible and targeted way, addressing immediate user needs while navigating the sensitive landscape of biometric data and privacy. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Safer Digital Future? Meta’s expansion of its facial recognition based anti-fraud tools to the UK represents a cautious yet significant step in leveraging AI to enhance online security. By focusing on tangible problems like celebrity impersonation scams and account recovery, Meta is attempting to demonstrate the positive applications of this controversial technology. For users in the UK and potentially Europe in the future, this could mean a more secure experience on Meta’s platforms, particularly in the face of rising online fraud . However, ongoing scrutiny, transparency, and robust privacy safeguards will be crucial to ensure that these tools are used responsibly and ethically, building trust as AI continues to play an increasingly prominent role in our digital lives.

Despite Ethereum's large stablecoin footprint, the Base blockchain has surpassed Ethereum in monthly stablecoin transfer volume, questioning ETH's dominance. Capital outflows from crypto investment products were substantial in late February, yet ETHA's year-to-date AUM growth remains positive, indicating mixed investor sentiment. Given the eroding fee market and mixed response to Trump's crypto reserve news, I recommend downgrading ETHA to 'hold' and suggest reducing crypto exposure. In early-December, I wrote about the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) and speculated that returns from longing Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and ETH proxies like ETHA could be lucrative in 2025 after lagging other digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ): Without significant growth in usage or higher gas fees, ETH will likely continue to be inflationary. In that reality, there is an opportunity cost in longing for ETH through ETFs like ETHA. All this said, I don't think the broader rally in the digital asset space is done yet, and I think recent capital flows are indicating it is Ethereum's turn to make a new high. Data by YCharts Unfortunately, the total opposite has happened, and Ethereum is currently down more than 30% from the time of that article just three months ago. Perhaps making matters worse for those with a diversified approach to digital assets, Bitcoin has held up relatively fine against most of the other coins in the market. In this update, we'll look at updated network data for Ethereum with February now in the books, capital flows so far in 2025, and supply/liquidity considerations with the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF. Ethereum Network Usage Cumulatively, the Ethereum network has generated over $20 billion in all time fees. However, as can be seen in the chart below, monthly fees have failed to revisit the highs from the 2020/2021 bull cycle: Monthly Fees, Ethereum (Token Terminal) During the month of February, Ethereum generated just $47.6 million in total fees. This was down a staggering 68% from the $150.9 million in fees from January and down 86.5% from the $353.1 million from fees in February 2024. February 2025 was also the worst month for Ethereum fees since July 2020. This lack of fees in the month has propelled the circulating price to fee ratio from an average of 211x fees in January to an average of 294x fees during February. Ethereum Circulating P/F Trend (Token Terminal) It should also be noted that the increase in the circulating P/F ratio got progressively more expensive throughout the month. As of article submission, the circulating P/F ratio over the last 24 hours is 495x - which makes ETH significantly more expensive than Solana ( SOL-USD ). Daily active addresses, or DAAs, on Ethereum's mainnet have remained stable for roughly four years: Ethereum DAAs vs Transactions (Token Terminal) Daily active addresses have generally averaged somewhere between 300-400k each month going back to October 2020. Transaction count has remained somewhat stable as well. The DAAs from Ethereum's scaling layers have generally been where all of the network growth has happened going back the last several years. 2024 saw a rather large surge, particularly on the Base blockchain ( COIN ): Ethereum L2 DAAs (Artemis) However, even DAA growth on L2s has stalled out since last October. Since then, three of the last four months have exhibited declines in stacked DAAs among the top L2 scaling chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. One of the biggest reasons I've held a long ETH bias despite what has been a concerning trend in fees for nearly a year has been that Ethereum commands a massive stablecoin footprint. At $120 billion in stables, Ethereum is far larger than any L2 in stable spend capacity and nearly double the next chain in the broader smart contract market. Ethereum's total stablecoin market share is still over 54%. But something is happening that may matter more than the raw capacity today: Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Artemis) In the chart above, I'm showing monthly stablecoin transfer volume through each of the L2 chains shared in the previous DAA chart as well as Ethereum, which is shown with the gray bars. The blue bars represent stablecoin transfer volume on Base. In December, Base passed Ethereum for monthly stablecoin transfer volume, and it has held that position over ETH for the two subsequent months - highlighted by $1.9 trillion in stable transfer volume during February. Base, Stable Volume (Token Terminal) Perhaps unsurprising given Base's reliance on USD Coin ( USDC-USD ) for 92% of the chain's stablecoin supply, the majority of this stablecoin transfer volume is credited to Circle according to Token Terminal. Circle is the issuer of the USDC stablecoin and at $2.6 trillion in stablecoin transfer volume over the last 30 days, Token Terminal and Artemis are either overstating the transfer data through some sort of methodology flaw or money velocity on Base is growing exponentially given the stablecoin supply on the network is just $4 billion. But if this data is indeed accurate, it might be a reason to consider an investment in Coinbase stock, but not necessarily a long ETH position. Capital Flows & ETHA Data The final week of February was a hugely negative one from a net flows standpoint: February Crypto Capital Flows (CoinShares) During just a single week, more than $2.9 billion in capital came out of crypto investment products, with the overwhelming majority of it flowing out of Bitcoin. The week was negative enough that it resulted in a negative February after what was a more mixed first three weeks of the month. Interestingly, Ethereum's MTD capital flows did remain positive for February despite the $300 million in single week outflow - a record for the asset. 000s of ETH 12/31/24 3/2/25 YTD Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) 1,435 1,350 -5.92% ETHA 950 1,010 6.32% Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( FETH ) 467 583 24.84% Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) 454 463 1.98% Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ) 121 96 -20.66% Source: The Block The iShares fund has generally been an outperformer regarding AUM growth this year compared to most of the other top five spot ETH ETFs - with Fidelity's product being a notable exception. But with 6.3% year to date growth in ETH held through the fund, capital flight out of ETHA hasn't yet been a major issue. There are two ways to look at this. On one hand, it could be indicative of a market that prefers ETHA as a trading vehicle. After all, ETHA typically accounts for the majority of spot ETH volume share during a typical session: Spot ETH ETF Volume (The Block/Yahoo Finance) On the other hand, the fact that ETH supply hasn't really left the ETHA product to a significant degree could also be an indication that the real selling hasn't even started yet. Consider the February flows by provider during the month of February: As of Feb 28, 2025 (CoinShares) At negative $639 million in February, iShares products hemorrhaged less than both Grayscale and Fidelity in nominal terms. This is impressive considering the iShares product AUM dwarfs the rest of the fund managers serving this market. I tend to view this as more of an indication that iShares fund buyers have a longer-term time horizon than Grayscale or even Fidelity fund buyers. But that's admittedly just a guess. ETH Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) It's also entirely possible that ETHA sellers could put continued pressure on the Ethereum market, with the coin now looking like it's given up support and falling back below major moving averages. Closing Thoughts Like many others who buy digital assets, my view has generally been that ETH is the 'digital gas' of the cryptocurrency market. With this view in mind, it's important for the fundamental thesis that the network generates fees. This keeps an organic bid on the token and also creates the burn mechanism, which reduces inflation. Thus, Ethereum's quickly eroding fee market even as secondary layers scale the network is making it increasingly difficult to justify ETH as an investment at this point in time. Furthermore, the recent 'crypto reserve' news from President Trump's Truth Social account has already completely reversed early gains. That's a bad sign from where I sit, and I personally think it's wise to lighten up crypto exposure at this point in time. I'm downgrading ETHA to 'hold.'",ETH-USD|ETHA,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-05 12:09:29

Amid discussions of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attending the White House Crypto Summit, the lawyer weighs in on the Ripple vs SEC case settlement. Let’s uncover what Jeremy Hogan says about the XRP lawsuit settlement and Ripple’s possible presence in the crypto summit. Is an Early Resolution Possible for XRP Lawsuit? In a recent revelation, legal expert Jeremy Hogan hinted at a possible early resolution in the XRP lawsuit. Notably, a community member asked Hogan if the SEC’s recent case dismissal spree might lead to a quick resolution of the Ripple appeal in March, with the injunction issue being tackled later. In response to the query, Jeremy commented that an early dismissal of the Ripple vs SEC case is possible. However, he cautioned that it’s essential to thoroughly resolve all aspects of the case before celebrating the potential conclusion. Will US SEC Dismiss the Ripple Lawsuit? Jeremy Hogan initiated a discussion on X, revealing that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse might participate in the White House crypto summit. Although some users questioned the accuracy of the information, Hogan reaffirmed his statement. The conversation subsequently shifted to speculation about a possible settlement in the XRP lawsuit. One scenario being discussed is that the SEC may reveal its intention to dismiss the appeal, mirroring its approach in the Coinbase lawsuit. The commissioners will subsequently vote on the matter, potentially delaying their decision until they address all outstanding issues. Jeremy Hogan’s acknowledgment of the possibility has ignited intense speculation about a potential XRP lawsuit settlement. The expectation is also fueled by the SEC’s recent pattern of dismissing cases. Recently, Donald Trump’s crypto reserve announcement has sparked discussions about a swift resolution. However, Jeremy Hogan dismissed discussions, asserting that the case could still take until May to conclude. Ripple vs SEC Case: Is a Potential Delay Awaiting? Triggered by the SEC’s progressive approach to crypto, the XRP community has been anticipating an early settlement of the lawsuit. However, experts like MetaLawMan and Jeremy Hogan have been long arguing about a possible delay. Both of them cited the legal complexities surrounding the Ripple vs SEC case. According to Jeremy Hogan, the injunction issued by Judge Analisa Torres has emerged as a significant obstacle to an early resolution of the XRP lawsuit. However, the latest developments have revived hopes for a quick resolution to the Ripple appeal. A resolution may be possible by March, with the injunction issue tackled separately.

The crypto world is buzzing with anticipation as reports confirm that former U.S. President Donald Trump is poised to announce a groundbreaking Bitcoin reserve strategy at the upcoming White House Crypto Summit. This monumental news, initially reported by crypto media outlet @solidintel_x on X and confirmed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, could mark a pivotal moment for Bitcoin and the entire digital asset industry. But what exactly does this mean, and what could be the implications of such a bold move? Let’s dive into the details and explore what this potential Bitcoin reserve strategy could entail. Why a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy is a Game Changer? Imagine the United States, a global economic powerhouse, officially adopting a Bitcoin reserve strategy . This isn’t just another headline; it’s a potential paradigm shift. For years, the crypto community has advocated for mainstream adoption, and a nation-state embracing Bitcoin as part of its reserves would send shockwaves across the globe. But why is this such a big deal? Validation and Legitimacy: A Bitcoin reserve strategy from the U.S. government would instantly inject immense legitimacy into Bitcoin. It signals that the world’s leading economy recognizes Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a viable store of value and a critical component of the future financial system. Increased Demand and Price Impact: Government adoption would inevitably drive up demand for Bitcoin. As the U.S. potentially allocates a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin, scarcity would increase, potentially leading to a significant surge in Bitcoin’s price. This could trigger a domino effect, encouraging other nations and institutions to follow suit. Reduced Volatility Over Time: While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, widespread institutional and governmental adoption, driven by a Bitcoin reserve strategy , could contribute to price stabilization over the long term. Increased liquidity and a broader base of holders could make Bitcoin less susceptible to drastic price swings. Fueling Innovation and Growth: A pro-Bitcoin stance from the U.S. government, manifested through a Bitcoin reserve strategy , could foster innovation within the crypto industry. It could encourage further development of Bitcoin-related technologies, businesses, and infrastructure within the United States. Trump Crypto Policy: A New Era? The announcement of a Bitcoin reserve strategy under a Trump administration signals a potentially dramatic shift in Trump crypto policy. Historically, government stances on cryptocurrency have been varied, often leaning towards caution and regulation. However, this move suggests a proactive and potentially bullish approach to digital assets. What could be driving this change in perspective? Economic Diversification: Nations hold reserves in various assets, including gold and foreign currencies, to diversify risk and maintain economic stability. Adding Bitcoin to these reserves could be seen as a forward-thinking move to diversify away from traditional assets and embrace a potentially high-growth asset class. Geopolitical Strategy: In an increasingly digital world, nations are vying for technological and financial leadership. Embracing Bitcoin and establishing a Bitcoin reserve strategy could be interpreted as a strategic move to position the U.S. at the forefront of the digital economy and maintain its global financial influence. Appealing to a Growing Crypto-Savvy Demographic: The crypto community is a significant and growing demographic. Adopting a pro-crypto stance, such as implementing a Bitcoin reserve strategy , could be a strategic move to appeal to this influential group and garner broader public support. White House Crypto Summit: The Stage for a Historic Announcement The choice of the White House Crypto Summit as the venue for this momentous announcement is no coincidence. The White House Crypto Summit is designed to bring together key stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry, policymakers, and government officials. It provides the perfect platform to unveil a significant policy shift like a Bitcoin reserve strategy , signaling the government’s commitment to engaging with and understanding the crypto space. What can we expect from the White House Crypto Summit in relation to this announcement? Detailed Policy Unveiling: Beyond the headline, the summit is likely to provide a detailed breakdown of the Bitcoin reserve strategy . This could include specifics on the scale of Bitcoin acquisition, the rationale behind the strategy, and the broader implications for U.S. economic policy. Industry Leader Engagement: The summit will likely feature discussions and panels with leading figures from the cryptocurrency industry. This engagement could signal a collaborative approach, where the government seeks input and partnership from the private sector in implementing its crypto policies. Global Impact Discussion: Given the international nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, the summit might also address the global implications of the U.S.’s Bitcoin reserve strategy . This could include discussions on international regulatory frameworks and the potential for global crypto adoption. Navigating the Challenges of Bitcoin Adoption While the prospect of a Bitcoin reserve strategy is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges that come with such a groundbreaking move. Adopting Bitcoin at a national level is not without its complexities. Challenge Description Regulatory Hurdles Existing regulatory frameworks may not be fully equipped to handle a national Bitcoin reserve strategy . New regulations and legal frameworks might be necessary to ensure compliance and security. Security and Custody Safeguarding a national Bitcoin reserve requires robust security measures and secure custody solutions. The government would need to implement state-of-the-art security protocols to protect these digital assets from theft or loss. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s inherent volatility remains a concern. While long-term adoption may mitigate volatility, short-term price fluctuations could pose challenges for managing a national reserve. Public Perception and Education Public understanding of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is still evolving. Effective communication and public education campaigns may be needed to build confidence and address potential skepticism surrounding a Bitcoin reserve strategy . US Bitcoin Policy: A Sign of Things to Come? Ultimately, the announcement of a Bitcoin reserve strategy could be the most significant development in US Bitcoin policy to date. It could represent a fundamental shift in the government’s approach to cryptocurrency, moving from cautious observation to proactive engagement and adoption. This could pave the way for further integration of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the U.S. financial system and economy. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates from the White House Crypto Summit and official government sources to get the most accurate information about the Bitcoin reserve strategy . Understand the Implications: Consider how this policy shift could impact the broader cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin’s price, and the regulatory landscape. Prepare for Potential Market Movements: Be aware that this announcement could trigger significant volatility in the crypto market. Manage your investments accordingly and exercise caution. Conclusion: A Bold Leap into the Bitcoin Future The potential unveiling of a Bitcoin reserve strategy by the Trump administration at the White House Crypto Summit is nothing short of revolutionary . It signals a potential sea change in how governments view and interact with cryptocurrency. While challenges remain, the benefits of such a move – increased legitimacy, price appreciation, and global leadership in the digital economy – are undeniable. This is a moment of immense excitement and potential for the crypto community, and the world will be watching closely as the details unfold. Will this be the catalyst that propels Bitcoin into mainstream adoption and solidifies its place as a key asset in the 21st century? The White House Crypto Summit might just hold the answer.

BTC price crawled back, rising by 6% in the last 24 hours. ETH and XRP prices rose by 7.26% and 5.6%. From a macro perspective, the falling US bond yields point to a strong crypto rebound, while the VIX index urges caution. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple Prices Stabilize as US Bond Yields Crash The bond market is providing relief to crypto investors as yields fall across the board. The ten-year yield dropped to 4.25% from the year-to-date high of 4.80%. It has dropped below the 200-day moving average pointing to further declines ahead. The 2-year and 30-year yields have dropped to 3.98% and 4.5%, much lower than their highest levels this year. Falling bond yields signal that the market anticipates the Fed to change its tune and deliver more cuts this year. The swap market estimates that there will be three rate cuts this year instead of the two that the Fed has hinted. BTC, ETH, and XRP prices often do well when the Fed is slashing interst rates as it often leads to a rotation from value to growth. A good example of this is what happened in 2020 when the Fed slashed rates to deal with the pandemic. Odds of a rate cut have risen after Donald Trump unveiled his trade war against top countries like Mexico and Canada. The risk for cryptocurrencies is that the VIX index, a popular volatility gauge in Wall Street, has risen to $26.2, its highest level since December 19. BTC, ETH, XRP Price Predictions So, how will popular BTC, ETH, and XRP trade in the next few days as bond yields fall? In addition to the macro events, the three coins will react to the upcoming crypto summit , nonfarm payrolls data , and Trump’s crypto reserves news. ETH Price Technical Analysis Ethereum price remains under pressure almost a month after it formed a death cross pattern. It is hovering near the key support at $2,155, the lowest level in August and September last year. The death cross points to more downside, with a potential near-term move below the $2,000 support level. A drop below that level will be a sign that bears have prevailed, and could open the door for a crash to $1,500 and below. That’s because Ethereum has already formed a triple-top pattern at $4,000. Support levels: $2,000, $1,800, and $1,500. Resistance levels: $2,500, $2,850, and $3,000. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis XRP is at a significant risk of a bearish breakdown as long as it is below the key level at $2.9180. This level is crucial because it coincides with the left and right shoulders of the head and shoulders pattern. This risk will be more pronounced if the XRP price crashes below the neckline at $1.9735. A move above the shoulders section will point to further gains, potentially to the YTD high. Support levels: $2, $1.97, and $1.5387 (61.8% retracement level). Resistance levels: $2.9, $3.4, and $4. XRP Price Chart BTC Price Technical Analysis BTC has found support at the 200-day moving average and the key point at $88,908, the neckline of the double-top pattern at $108,230. Its daily chart presents a blurry outlook, meaning that the coin may ultimately breakout in either direction. BTC Price Chart Therefore, the ideal way is to identify key support and resistance levels. More gains will be confirmed if the Bitcoin price rises above $95,000 followed by $100,000. One analyst warned that Bitcoin price may struggle to hit $100k soon. On the other hand, a crash below the support at $78,308 (last week’s low), will point to more downside to $73,500 (March 2024 high).

The wild ride in the meme coin market has taken a sharp turn south. After a euphoric surge fueled by the anticipation around Donald Trump’s presidential run, the market has experienced a significant correction, wiping out a substantial chunk of its value. Are we witnessing a major crypto crash in the meme coin sector, or is this a necessary market consolidation phase? Let’s dive into the details and explore what this means for your favorite digital doges and frogs. Meme Coin Market Crash: Decoding the 56% Plunge The numbers don’t lie – the meme coin market has shrunk dramatically. Since reaching a peak in early December, the total market capitalization has plummeted by a staggering 56%. Cointelegraph reports that, according to CoinMarketCap data, the meme coin market cap stood at $54 billion on March 5th. This is a considerable drop from the $124 billion it commanded in early December. To put it in perspective, the sector even touched a high of $137 billion on December 8th. The descent wasn’t a straight line down. There were brief upward blips, particularly in January, coinciding with meme coin launches associated with Donald Trump and Melania Trump. However, these rallies proved to be short-lived, unable to reverse the overall downward trend. What triggered this dramatic crypto crash in the meme coin realm? Analysts point to a confluence of factors: Global Economic Uncertainty: The broader economic landscape plays a significant role in investor sentiment. Global uncertainties often lead investors to become risk-averse, and meme coins, being highly speculative assets, are among the first to feel the pinch. Lack of Regulation: The largely unregulated nature of the crypto space, and particularly the meme coin segment, creates an environment ripe for volatility and manipulation. Insider Trading and Market Manipulation: Unfortunately, the meme coin market has seen its share of insider trading allegations and pump-and-dump schemes, often fueled by celebrity endorsements. These manipulative practices erode investor confidence and contribute to market instability. Celebrity-Driven Pump-and-Dump Schemes: The allure of quick riches has led to numerous instances of celebrity-promoted meme coins. While some might see this as marketing, many of these initiatives are criticized as pump-and-dump schemes, leaving retail investors holding the bag when the hype fades. Market Consolidation: Will Top Altcoins Lead the Recovery? Amidst the market downturn, a narrative of market consolidation is emerging. Zeta Markets co-founder Anmol Singh suggests that this correction could pave the way for a more focused market, with capital concentrating around established meme coins. This implies that while the overall meme coin space might shrink, the leading projects could emerge stronger. Which meme coins are likely to survive and thrive during this market consolidation? Singh highlights a few key contenders: Dogecoin (DOGE): The original meme coin, Dogecoin, continues to hold significant sway. Pepe (PEPE): A relatively newer entrant, Pepe has quickly gained popularity within the meme coin community. Bonk (BONK): Another prominent meme coin that has captured attention. Dogwifhat (WIF): Known for its quirky name and community. Official Trump Token: Reflecting the continued interest in politically themed meme coins. The expectation is that smaller, less established meme coin projects may struggle to survive this period of market consolidation , potentially fading into obscurity. This culling process, while painful for some, could ultimately lead to a healthier and more sustainable meme coin ecosystem, albeit a smaller one. Dogecoin Dominance: The King of the Meme Coin Hill and the Altcoin Landscape Even in a shrinking market, Dogecoin remains the undisputed king of meme coins. It commands a dominant 53% market share within the meme coin sector. This highlights the enduring appeal and brand recognition of DOGE, despite the emergence of numerous competitors. Beyond Dogecoin, other altcoins are vying for attention in the meme coin space. The current top contenders, based on market capitalization, include: Shiba Inu (SHIB): Often considered the second-largest meme coin, SHIB continues to be a major player. Pepe (PEPE): As mentioned earlier, Pepe’s rapid rise has solidified its position among the top meme coins. Official Trump Token: Political meme coins are a niche but notable segment, and the Trump token is a leading example. Despite the recent downturn, some prominent figures in the crypto world remain optimistic about the future of meme coins. Tron founder Justin Sun, for instance, still sees potential in this asset class. However, Sun advises a cautious approach, recommending that investors focus on established names like Dogecoin rather than chasing after newer, unproven projects. His perspective underscores the risk-reward dynamic inherent in meme coin investing – the potential for high returns comes with equally high risks. Navigating the Volatile Meme Coin Market: Challenges and Opportunities The meme coin market , by its very nature, is characterized by extreme volatility. The recent crypto crash serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved. While the potential for explosive gains is a major draw, investors must be acutely aware of the potential pitfalls. Challenges in the Meme Coin Market: Extreme Volatility: Price swings can be dramatic and unpredictable, leading to significant losses for unprepared investors. Pump-and-Dump Schemes: The market is susceptible to manipulation, with pump-and-dump schemes posing a constant threat. Lack of Fundamental Value: Many meme coins lack underlying utility or strong fundamentals, making them purely speculative assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape adds another layer of risk to the meme coin market. Potential Opportunities in the Meme Coin Market: High Potential Returns: Meme coins can deliver extraordinary returns in short periods, attracting investors seeking quick profits. Community-Driven Projects: Some meme coins are built around strong and engaged communities, which can contribute to their longevity and growth. Cultural Significance: Meme coins often tap into internet culture and trends, giving them a unique appeal and virality. Conclusion: A Reset for the Meme Coin Mania? The 56% drop in the meme coin market signals a significant correction, a reality check after months of exuberant growth. While the dream of overnight riches might seem further away, this crypto crash could be a necessary step towards a more mature and sustainable meme coin ecosystem. Market consolidation around leading altcoins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu, and Pepe suggests a potential shift in focus towards projects with stronger community support and brand recognition. Whether this marks the end of the meme coin mania or simply a pause before the next surge remains to be seen. For investors, navigating this landscape requires caution, due diligence, and a realistic understanding of the inherent risks and rewards of the meme coin market.

OI represents the total funds allocated in outstanding futures contracts, effectively measuring the amount of leverage in the bitcoin system. Since these contracts are denominated in dollars, their value fluctuates with bitcoin's price. To provide a more stable measure, we assess open interest in bitcoin terms, which eliminates price-based distortions. Glassnode data shows that since November, bitcoin open interest has dropped from 546,000 BTC to 413,000 BTC across all exchanges, with a significant portion of this decline attributed to the unwinding of CME open interest, particularly in the basis trade . Meanwhile, bitcoin dropped from $109,000 to $78,000 and then recovered to $90,000. This would assume that a large part of this recent run-up has been spot-driven rather than leverage-driven. Additionally, Binance—the second-largest exchange by OI—has seen its OI drop to a 12-month low of just over 100,000 BTC, indicating that leverage has been significantly reduced from a retail perspective. This decline reflects a sharp reduction in speculative activity, driven by bitcoin’s extreme price volatility over the past few months. Furthermore, open interest as a percentage of bitcoin’s market cap has fallen below 2% for the first time since February 2024, underscoring the sharp decline in speculation and leverage.",Markets|open interest|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 12:15:00

That has helped BTC bounce to nearly $90K, with the total crypto market cap rising to the $2.9 trillion mark. The recovery could extend further as the recent trade war fears and market volatility have reignited bets on Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the market is now pricing in at least three rate cuts for this year, while the 10-year Treasury yield has retreated to 4.15%, down from 4.80% at the time of Trump's inauguration. Meanwhile, Germany's decision to abandon its fiscal constraints has led to soaring bond yields, prompting a sell-off in the dollar index that could encourage risk-taking in the market. As a result, there is a chance that bitcoin may revisit its weekend high of $95,000, particularly as technical charts indicate signs of seller exhaustion. However, worsening growth concerns could limit these gains. Just two days ago, the Atlanta Fed's GDP forecast turned negative at -2.8% , raising fears of stagflation, as noted by Singapore-based QCP Capital. The firm stressed the importance of monitoring corporate yield spreads—both high-yield and investment-grade bonds—in relation to U.S. Treasury yields for signs of market stress. ""While this isn't signaling panic right now, it's a trend worth monitoring closely,"" QCP said in a Telegram broadcast. An important consideration is how much of the decline in the 10-year yield and the weakness in the dollar can be attributed to traders adjusting their expectations about U.S. economic exceptionalism , which was largely based on Biden era's fiscal splurge. Given the rise of ETFs and Trump's pro-crypto stance, bitcoin has become more of a U.S. play, and a shift in the U.S. exceptionalism narrative could lead to BTC volatility. JPMorgan, however, foresees strengthening of the U.S. exceptionalism narrative under Trump's Presidency. All of this means that Wednesday's U.S. ISM non-manufacturing (services) PMI and Friday's nonfarm payrolls could significantly influence the crypto markets. There are also rumors that President Trump will unveil the crypto reserve strategy at the White House Crypto Summit this Friday. With Trump having made considerable promises, the markets will be watching closely to see if he delivers; otherwise, there could be further turmoil ahead. Stay alert!

Derivatives Positioning Positioning in BTC and ETH CME futures remains light despite signs of market stability, leaving the basis near 6%. BTC, ETH perpetual funding rates are marginally positive, indicating continued caution among traders. BCH leads the majors in terms of price and open interest gains, but the flat 24-hour cumulative volume delta questions the sustainability of the price surge. BTC risk reversals show a bias for puts in mid-March and end-of-the-month expiries. The pricing flips decisively bullish in favor of calls only after the April expiry. ETH options show a similar story.

The Fear and Greed Index, which measures investor emotions in markets like bitcoin, ranging from 0 (lowest sentiment) to 100 (highest sentiment), has shown an extended ‘extreme fear’ reading in the past several days as prices whipsawed between the $83,000 and $95,000 levels. The index helps identify whether investors are too scared (potential buying opportunity) or too greedy (possible market correction), tending to act as a contrarian indicator in the short term. It is based on price volatility and momentum, social media sentiment, Google trends data and bitcoin’s overall market share. “Bitcoin’s plunge into 'Extreme Fear' on the Fear & Greed Index, its first since September 2024, when BTC traded at $53K, echoes a pivotal historical low,” Vincent Liu, CIO at trading firm Kronos Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Back then, Bitcoin’s value doubled over the next three months, hinting at a potential buying opportunity for savvy investors.” “Amid today’s market volatility, fueled by trade tariffs and broader macroeconomic uncertainties, this moment could emerge as a golden entry point, provided global trade tensions ease and overall economic sentiment strengthens,” Liu added. Bitcoin and several major tokens, including Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and xrp (XRP), surged Sunday following President Trump's announcement of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve. But the initial excitement was short-lived due to profit-taking amid the lack of concrete plans and a risk-off mood in broader equity markets. Trump's tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico, and China further impacted markets, and traders are now awaiting more clarity from the upcoming White House Crypto Summit for cues on future positioning.",Markets|Bitcoin|fear and greed index|market analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ADA|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 12:16:36
41188223,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137041,1741176996,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Speculation: U.S. May Revalue Gold Reserves for Dramatic Cryptocurrency Purchases,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-gold-reserves-crypto-purchases/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a rather astonishing proposition: Could the United States government be considering re-evaluating its massive gold reserves to plunge into the cryptocurrency market? This intriguing scenario, recently highlighted by Bloomberg macro strategist Simon White, suggests a potentially seismic shift in how nations might approach digital asset funding. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating speculation and explore what it could mean for the future of finance and the crypto landscape. The Rumor Mill: U.S. Considering Cryptocurrency Purchases with Gold Revaluation? According to investment intelligence platform ZeroHedge, Simon White, a strategist at Bloomberg, has pointed out some intriguing whispers circulating in financial circles. The core of the discussion revolves around the idea that the U.S. might be looking at its substantial gold reserves as a potential piggy bank to finance significant cryptocurrency purchases . This speculation gains traction in light of recent announcements, including mentions of a national crypto reserve, albeit with little clarity on the acquisition strategy. The question on everyone’s mind is: how would the U.S. government actually acquire these digital assets? Some analysts propose a bold, albeit unconventional, approach: revaluing the nation’s gold holdings. Let’s break down the mechanics of this potential financial maneuver: Historical Gold Valuation : The U.S. currently values its 8,000-ton gold reserves at a fixed rate of $42.22 per ounce, a figure set way back in 1973. Modern Market Value : In today’s market, gold trades at significantly higher prices. Revaluing these reserves to reflect current market rates would drastically increase their book value. Federal Reserve Asset Boost : Such a revaluation would inflate the assets on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Treasury Funding for Crypto : This inflated asset base could then, in theory, allow the U.S. Treasury to withdraw funds, effectively creating capital for substantial cryptocurrency purchases . While Simon White himself considers this scenario to be somewhat unlikely, the mere suggestion sparks a crucial conversation about the evolving strategies nations might employ to engage with the burgeoning digital economy. Why Would the U.S. Consider Such a Drastic Move for Digital Assets Funding? The notion of using gold reserves to fund cryptocurrency purchases might seem radical, but let’s consider the potential motivations behind such a strategy: Embracing the Future of Finance : Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are increasingly viewed as integral components of the future financial landscape. Strategic investment could position the U.S. at the forefront of this technological revolution. Diversification of National Reserves : Nations traditionally hold reserves in gold and foreign currencies. Adding digital assets to the mix could be seen as a move towards diversifying national reserves in the digital age. Strategic Influence in the Crypto Market : Significant cryptocurrency purchases by a major economic power like the U.S. could exert considerable influence on the crypto market, potentially shaping its trajectory and ensuring regulatory compliance and stability. Economic Stimulus : Investing in emerging technologies like cryptocurrency could be viewed as a form of economic stimulus, fostering innovation and job creation within the digital asset sector. The Potential Ripple Effects: Impact on Inflation, Gold, and the Dollar While the idea of revaluing gold reserves for cryptocurrency purchases is intriguing, it’s crucial to consider the potential ramifications. Simon White rightly points out that such a move could trigger significant ripple effects across various markets: Inflationary Pressures? Injecting a substantial amount of newly created capital into the market, even if earmarked for cryptocurrency purchases , could potentially exacerbate inflationary pressures. Increased liquidity, even within the crypto sphere, can have knock-on effects across the broader economy. Gold Market Volatility? Revaluing gold reserves , while seemingly beneficial on paper, could introduce volatility into the gold market. The perception of gold’s role in national reserves might shift, leading to price fluctuations and investor uncertainty. Dollar’s Global Reserve Status at Risk? Perhaps the most significant concern is the potential impact on the U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency. Unconventional financial maneuvers, like drastically revaluing gold reserves to fund cryptocurrency purchases , could be perceived as a departure from traditional fiscal prudence, potentially undermining global confidence in the dollar. US Crypto Policy: Navigating Uncharted Waters The speculation surrounding gold reserves and cryptocurrency purchases highlights the evolving landscape of US crypto policy . Governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate, integrate, and leverage digital assets. The U.S., as a global economic leader, faces the challenge of striking a balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks associated with this nascent asset class. Key questions surrounding US crypto policy include: Regulatory Clarity : Providing clear and consistent regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is paramount to fostering sustainable growth and investor confidence. Consumer Protection : Safeguarding consumers from fraud and illicit activities within the crypto space is a critical responsibility for policymakers. Financial Stability : Ensuring that the growth of the crypto market does not pose systemic risks to the broader financial system is a key concern for central banks and regulatory bodies. Innovation and Competitiveness : US crypto policy must also aim to foster innovation and maintain the nation’s competitiveness in the rapidly evolving global digital economy. Federal Reserve’s Role in Digital Assets Funding The Federal Reserve ‘s potential involvement in digital assets funding , even indirectly through the revaluation of gold reserves , raises complex questions about central bank mandates and the future of monetary policy. Traditionally, central banks focus on managing inflation and maintaining financial stability. Directly or indirectly engaging in cryptocurrency purchases would represent a significant departure from conventional central banking practices. Considerations for the Federal Reserve in this evolving landscape: Area Consideration Monetary Policy How would cryptocurrency purchases impact traditional monetary policy tools and objectives? Financial Stability What are the potential risks to financial stability associated with central bank involvement in digital asset markets? Operational Challenges Does the Federal Reserve possess the operational infrastructure and expertise to manage and secure digital asset holdings? Public Perception How would the public and international community perceive central bank involvement in digital assets funding ? Conclusion: A Bold Move or a Risky Gamble with Gold Reserves? The speculation that the U.S. might revalue its gold reserves to finance cryptocurrency purchases is undoubtedly a captivating, if somewhat improbable, scenario. It underscores the growing recognition of digital assets as a force to be reckoned with in the global financial system. While the likelihood of this specific strategy being implemented remains uncertain, the conversation it sparks is invaluable. It forces us to confront the evolving role of gold reserves in the digital age, the strategic importance of digital assets funding , and the complex policy decisions facing nations as they navigate the uncharted waters of the crypto revolution. Whether a bold move or a risky gamble, the mere suggestion highlights the dramatic shifts underway in the world of finance.

Indicators are mixed in their signalling. MARA Holdings' most recent earnings show overall strong financial figures as well as healthy operational metrics. MARA stock seems to be modestly undervalued, as there are some inconsistencies with how the P/S ratio reflects revenue growth. As a result of the bearish technicals, I initiate MARA at a hold rather than a buy, as the fundamental setup is actually net positive in my view. Thesis Despite Trump 2.0's pro-crypto stance, MARA Holdings, Inc. (MARA) stock has fallen over 40% in the past year. In the below analysis, I find that the technicals are highly concerning, with the chart and moving averages being bearish. There are some mixed signals in the indicators that suggest some near-term reprieve, however. As for the fundamentals, I find Q4 earnings to be strong overall, despite relatively sluggish revenue growth. Operational metrics also showed healthy improvements. In addition, after analyzing the P/S ratio, I find that the stock is modestly undervalued versus revenue growth despite being at a premium to the IT sector. Overall, I would say that MARA is currently a hold but if the technicals improve, then the stock would become attractive as the fundamental setup is fine. Technicals Charting Yahoo Finance Trends MARA stock is in a heavy downtrend that doesn't show any signs of ending according to this chart. The stock is experiencing resistance at the trend line currently, and this downtrend has been in effect since late November. There has been an increase in bullish volume lately, but the stock has been unable to breakout thus far. Support There is no support for MARA stock in this timeframe, with the stock being near six-month lows. The six-month low was only set just a few trading days ago. There may be longer-term support if you zoom out, but for this article, I will focus on the last six months of trading activity. Resistance There are three key resistance areas in addition to the downtrend line. The nearest one is in the high 14.8s. This level was a floor for the stock from September to early November. The next resistance level is in the mid-16.6s and represents resistance in mid-September and early October, while being support in December and January. Lastly, there is also resistance at around 20. This level was a downside gap in late January and was also resistance in late October. Takeaway To me, this chart seems quite negative in its signalling. MARA stock is bound in a heavy downtrend with no significant near term support levels below. In addition, there are multiple resistance levels above that should prevent near term gains from occurring. Moving Averages Yahoo Finance Simple Moving Average (SMA) The 50-day SMA recently formed a death cross with the 200-day SMA, a longer term bearish signal for the stock. The 50-day SMA's trajectory worsened in early February, and currently it is on a steady pace downward. With the 200-day SMA holding relatively level, the gap between the lines is expanding significantly to reflect the increase in long term bearish momentum. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The latest crossover is a bearish one that occurred back in mid-December. That shows the bears have been dominant for an extended period. Currently, the gap between 9-day EMA and the 21-day EMA is significantly large, but recently, it has shrunken marginally as the stock remains above the 9 day EMA. This likely just shows a pause in near term bearish momentum rather than a major shift in sentiment. Bollinger Bands The stock broke above the midline in mid-January, giving hope to the bulls that the downtrend was weakening. However, those hopes were dashed rather quickly as the stock plunged back beneath the midline only days later. Since then, MARA seems to have experienced some resistance at the midline, showing that the downtrend remains intact and strong. Takeaway I believe there are not many positives to take away from these moving averages. The SMAs just recently had a death cross, the EMAs are in a bearish state, and since the stock failed to maintain the midline breakout on the Bollinger Bands, the downtrend is highly intact. Indicators Yahoo Finance Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) After around a month of being inseparable, the MACD slid a notable amount below the signal line in late February. This is a signal of weakness, but overall the gap between the lines has remained relatively small and is now closing as shown by the previous two green histogram bars. This shows that the bears may not be as dominant as feared. Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) The RSI currently has a reading of 39.95 after rebounding from a sub 30 level. That indicates that while the bears are still in control of the stock, their grasp has loosened somewhat. Despite this rebound, the RSI still remains in a downtrend that dates back to the November peak in the indicator, and so further weakness is possible at least until the RSI is able to break out. Stochastics Recently, the %K line broke above the %D line within the oversold 20 zone for a bullish crossover. The gap between these lines is expanding to show that near term bullishness is accelerating. Furthermore, both lines have exited the 20 zone as another signal that the bears' grasp on the stock is now loosening. The next challenge for the stochastics is whether it can break through 50. That would be a sign that the bulls are back in control. Takeaway While there is still overall weakness in each of these indicators, they also show near term improvement that should provide some relief to investors. The MACD histogram is now bullish, the RSI has fought back above the 30 level, and the stochastics had a recent bullish crossover. While both the RSI and stochastics remain below 50, they are showing significant improvements. Fundamentals Earnings Data by YCharts Quarterly Results In late February, MARA reported their 2024 Q4 earnings and showed strong results overall. They posted revenues of $214.4 million, up 37% YoY and a diluted EPS of $1.24, up significantly from the prior year period's $0.66. As you can see in the chart above, revenue growth remains resilient, but it is at below average levels compared with the past three years. Q4's results are unable to sufficiently provide reassurance to investors that the growth slowdown is over. For EPS, Q4's results represents the second-best quarter in the past three years, only bested by 2024 Q1 's $1.26 in EPS. Both of these figures also surpassed expectations quite easily as revenue beat by $30.47 million while GAAP EPS beat by $0.63, showing strong performance versus consensus estimates. Another financial figure worth mentioning is adjusted EBITDA. They reported $794.4 million for this figure, representing YoY growth of 207%. This shows that the operations of the business are experiencing strength. Operational Metrics MARA Holdings Shareholder Letter In terms of their operations, MARA also reported strong figures. They reported that their total blocks won is up 25% YoY to 703 for Q4. Their cost of revenue per petahash per day improved by 5% from the year ago quarter. For energized hashrate, they posted a figure of 53.2 EH/s, up 115% YoY. Furthermore, MARA bested four other comparable miners in this metric by a healthy margin. At the end of the year, they had a total of 44,893 bitcoin as they mined 2,492 bitcoin and purchased another 15,574 in their Q4. Overall, I believe these operation metrics were strong and suggest to me that the business is experiencing meaningful improvements in efficiency and performance. With Trump 2.0's crypto-friendly policies likely coming in the near future, MARA looks prepared to be a key beneficiary of those tailwinds. Valuation Data by YCharts Price To Sales Ratio (P/S) The P/S ratio is currently at quite far below average levels in relation to the past three years of the multiple's data. It now has a reading of 6.866 after being above 12 in late 2024. This ratio was above 18 at the end of 2023. I believe this ratio shows around fair valuation to perhaps some undervaluation in MARA stock. As discussed earlier, revenue growth is currently showing resilience, but relative to the past three years, it is at below average levels. Therefore, the P/S chart is reflecting the fundamentals rather well, as the ratio is also at a below average level. However, revenue growth is currently significantly better than back in mid-2022 to early 2023, but the multiple is lower now than during most of that period. This suggests some undervaluation and shows inconsistency with how MARA is valued relative to its financials. The Information Technology sector median P/S ratio is currently 3.06 and so the stock is at a major premium to peers. Do note that most companies in this sector are not in the crypto business. Therefore, Trump 2.0 tailwinds may not apply so significantly to them. In addition, MARA's strong EPS results and impressive adjusted EBITDA improvements are likely to justify a premium for its business. Overall, personally, I would pay more attention to the valuation versus financial growth assessment since there may be comparability issues with the IT sector as a whole. Conclusion In the above analysis, I have determined the technicals to be net bearish for MARA stock. It is because of this concerning technical outlook that I believe this stock is a hold because the fundamental setup is actually net positive in my view. Most recent earnings were quite strong and operational metrics were healthy. Furthermore, the valuation seems to be on the low side currently, as the P/S may not fully reflect the resilience of revenue growth. Therefore, if the technicals were to improve to a more neutral position, I would find MARA stock to be rather attractive.",MARA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|MINING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-05 13:39:39

The announcement initially only mentions three Crypto Assets: Solana, Cardano, and Ripple. But does that mean the other assets like BNB, AVAX, and others are sidelined? Market experts have taken different approaches to interpret Trump's true social post in ways that suggest other crypto assets might also see a boost with this announcement. Binance former CEO Changpeng Zhao was one of the most vocal analysts yesterday, highlighting a part of the president's tweet that says “others” will be considered later. But while the “others” remain speculation, a new PayFi coin showing an independent surge seems to be catching investors' attention. Here are the details. Is BNB a Good Bet In This Uncertain Crypto Season? Before Trump's announcement yesterday, one main point raising confusion was the current state of the crypto market: Are we in a bull or bear season? While the year started in a strong bullish direction, the days that followed have shown many red candles, suggesting a reversal into a bearish market. However, yesterday's announcement seems to be causing a change from the bearish move that is currently overwhelming the market. But, while Trump's announcement only identified 3 coins initially, the entire market seems to have reacted to the news, with the BNB price moving briefly from $570 to $634. However, the BNB Coin is not explicitly mentioned in the announcement, which poses a hard bargain to go all-in for a long-term investment. A combination of different factors, including the growth of the Binance exchange, could contribute immensely to the growth of the BNB price in the future. However, the Trump effect does not look like a factor that could contribute much to the BNB coin anytime soon. Assessing AVAX Potential Following Trump's Announcement The AVAX coin responded similarly to the Trump announcement, briefly rising 6.9% in the last 24 hours. However, this does not look like a long-term solution to continue pushing the price higher. The Avalanche layer 1 blockchain presents an upgrade to the older DeFi solution, promoting faster, cheaper transactions, which has been boosting its growth in the last few months. However, with the growing numbers of layer 1 solutions in the crypto market, the AVAX future is clouded in uncertainty as it continues to battle competition. And since it was not listed in Trump's announcement, the growth rate of the AVAX coin might be slowed in the coming months. Why Remittix Continues Growing Even Without A mention The ongoing Remittix ICO is taking a new run higher with seasoned and new investors joining the presale from other crypto assets. This dynamic investment has set the token on a new surge path, with investors claiming up to a 5x rise in the last few weeks since the presale started. As a result, while the Trump announcement added a little push to the overall market growth, the Remittix token is projected for a higher growth in the coming weeks independent of the Trump effect. A primary factor projected to contribute to the Remittix token's growth is the token's utility and the exchange's impact on the payment sector. The Remittix exchange crypto to FIAT is a next-level solution projected to see market-wide acceptance as it makes payment easy for individuals and businesses. Hence, the bullish sentiment around the Remittix token, with bull projections as high as 50x this year. The utility of the Remittix token makes it an ideal investment for investors looking to grow their portfolio continuously. Analysts predict a surge that could easily rival the listed coins in the US crypto reserve this year, leveraging a widespread utility. Now is the best time to buy the Remittix token before the price becomes too high. Check the presale website using any of the links below to start today.

From massive hacks to sell-offs and Trump’s pro-crypto impact, investors have seen both extremes of the market. Amid this turbulence, experts have found two high-flying crypto projects, PEPE and Panshibi ($SHIBI) , set to hit major gains in the coming weeks. Considering the latest PEPE price prediction and the rapid growth of the new Panshibi coin in its ongoing presale, market analysts are confident these two present the most promising investment prospects this year. PEPE Price Prediction Amid Global Crypto Market Surge PEPE price charts display an unmistakable pattern of an upswing that is catching the eye of investors and analysts across various digital platforms. According to PEPE trading data , this meme coin keeps seeing a decrease in a short span, the latest being a 17% decline within 24 hours to trade at $0.000006634. Analysts have attributed this surge to active social media engagement and growing trade figures. This momentum explains why the latest PEPE price prediction points to the token’s recent activities as proof of viral sentiment's power in the crypto market. Across various digital news platforms and discussion forums, PEPE price prediction has become a hot topic of discourse. Judging by its increasing trade numbers and bullish projections, PEPE is set to leverage this surge in global community interest. For market analysts, if PEPE continues with the current momentum, the crypto could witness a 225.07% surge to hit $0.00002859 by the end of Q1 2025. Panshibi ($SHIBI) Sets Up for Major Gains With Record-Breaking Presale and Innovative Offerings Panshibi (SHIBI) has made a statement with its setup to be the standout token in a market marked by volatile and short-lived spikes in other meme coins. This new meme project is built in a safe environment containing a fully audited smart contract, a liquidity pool vested for 10 years, and team tokens for 2 years. With this setup, investors are confident about Panshibi’s prospects amid widespread market uncertainties. Moreover, the ongoing Panshibi presale further bolsters this sentiment. With a process carefully organized into 15 stages, each stage is scheduled to witness a token value increase. At press time, the presale is far gone into its fourth stage, with only a few weeks left. There's only a limited timeframe for early investors, especially if you're looking to accumulate $SHIBI at the current price of $0.005. From its robust setup, Panshibi sets itself apart from other tokens, battling price volatility and technical drawbacks. Best security practices and the clear classification of the presale stages have attracted recognition from various market analysts. Market observers point out how the token’s design and regulated release schedule set a high standard in a competitive terrain. More so, investor interest in tokens that blend solid market fundamentals with a steady growth model is at a record high. As the Panshibi presale comes to its final days, investors now get a critical entry point for those wishing to invest early and maximize their gains. With its carefully laid-out tokenomics and distinctive presale structure, Panshibi is primed to take over the volatile market this year with significant gains. Besides PEPE price prediction, here is another unique opportunity for those savvy investors hoping to buy into a secure and promising project. Considering the imminent structured growth now is the best time to buy $SHIBI.

Data from CoinMarketCap shows AAVE trading at $220 by the time of writing after a 26.6% surge within 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s market cap is also up to $3.33 billion, while its 24-hour trading volume has more than doubled to $728.45 million. Aave’s “Most Important” Proposal On March 4, Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) founder Marc Zeller announced that the organization had presented an Aave Request For Comment (ARFC) titled Aavenomics Implementation: Part One. The proposal, considered the most important in the protocol’s history, contains updated Aavenomics for the DeFi lending platform and seeks community feedback. Aavenomics implementation: Part one builds on the [TEMP CHECK] Aavenomics update, which the community approved in August 2024. The TEMP CHECK proposed creating a clear path for Aave to redistribute net excess revenue to key ecosystem contributors. The new proposal aims to implement the first part of the Aavenomics presented in the TEMP CHECK, including the excess revenue redistribution, updating AAVE tokenomics, and managing the asset’s secondary liquidity protocol. In addition, Aave is looking to finalize the migration from LEND, its previous governance and utility token, to AAVE. Creating AFC And Managing Liquidity The first implementation of Aavenomics has six main focus points. The ACI is looking to form a four-member Aave Finance Committee (AFC) with a 3/4 signature threshold consisting of itself, the DeFi economic security systems provider Chaos Labs, the DeFi solutions provider Tokenlogic, and the DeFi risk management entity Llamarisk. The ARFC also proposes authorizing Tokenlogic to implement financing for the proposed budget for the first six months of Aavenomics. This will be made possible through monthly treasury management proposals and setting token approval allowances. For Aave’s liquidity management, the proposal aims to implement a buyback and distribution program that will mandate the AFC to use treasury token allowances to acquire AAVE on secondary markets and return them to the ecosystem reserve. This program will begin with a $1 million per week AAVE acquisition for the first six months, followed by an amount tailored to the overall protocol budget. Additionally, this first part of the Aavenomics implementation will see the development of new features. One of them is the Anti-GHO, a non-transferable ERC20 token that can be used to clear GHO debt or converted to staked GHO (StkGHO). GHO is Aave’s stablecoin, which has hit a circulating supply of at least $200 million. Another is Umbrella, a system that will protect users from bad debt in case of market crashes. Meanwhile, the ACI revealed that Aave’s cash pile has increased by 115% to $115 million since mid-2024.

However, a recent $20M move by a Solana whale has stirred speculation about whether a reversal was imminent. As the Solana blockchain shows signs of strength by outperforming other blockchains by revenues, can SOL price avoid a potential reversal and rally towards the $300 peak? Solana Whale Moves $20M SOL – Impact on Price? Solana price is facing potential sell-side pressure from whales. This is after a Solana whale unstaked 134,902 SOL tokens valued at nearly $20M. This large address is preparing to sell after setting multiple limit orders between the prices of $171 and $294. SOL unstaking This move happened a few hours after the FTX/Alameda bankruptcy estate deposited 3.03M SOL to Binance. According to Lookonchain, these tokens are worth approximately $438M. If large addresses are unstaking SOL and moving tokens to exchanges, it could have a major implication on the price. The additional selling pressure from FTX unlocks could impact Solana price as the crypto market remains in a state of fear. Can Network Growth Fuel a Rally to $300? As whale activity increases the risk of a bearish Solana price prediction , blockchain activity suggests that a rally to $300 is likely to happen. In February, Solana dominated blockchain app revenue, with apps generating $285M in revenue. Solana app revenue This dominance suggests that decentralized applications (dApps) created on Solana are gaining traction and driving capital inflows to the blockchain. This could fuel the bullish sentiment around SOL and potentially drive a rally to $300. However as Coingape previously reported, high app revenues suggest Solana price may have hit a local top . If this is the case, SOL may continue struggling under bearish pressure. Key Solana Price Levels to Watch Solana price today trades at $145 after an 8% gain in 24 hours. SOL is moving within a descending parallel channel on the daily chart, which shows a bearish trend is prevalent. However, bulls are attempting a breakout from the upper trendline. If buying pressure leads to SOL making a decisive breakout from the upper trendline, it may drive a price rally. The RSI is rising, indicating that buyers are gaining momentum. However, the RSI value below 50 shows that bears remain in control. The on-balance volume indicator is also rising, which shows that the buying pressure is gaining strength. This rising OBV indicates that investors are actively buying SOL, which may precede a rally. If these bullish trends continue, SOL faces resistance at $176. Breaking out of this level may kickstart a rally towards $300. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Solana’s technical outlook shows that despite the recent gains, a bearish momentum remains in play. However, a surge in network activity could boost investor confidence and support a $300 rally for Solana price.

XRP Rival Remittix Secures 4x Gains As Crypto Makes A Comeback,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/is-the-bullrun-back-or-is-it-just-a-bull-trap-xrp-rival-remittix-secures-4x-gains-as-crypto-makes-a-comeback,"President Donald Trump’s announcement of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve—featuring Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano—has sparked talk of a bull run, though others call it a potential bull trap. The market remains uncertain if these price increases reflect a stable market recovery or a temporary upward trend ahead of any future market shift. Remittix (RTX), the “XRP rival”, has investors exhibiting strong interest in projects with concrete uses through its 4x price gains. U.S. Crypto Reserve: The Catalyst for Altcoin Season President Trump’s declaration to integrate leading cryptocurrencies into a U.S. Crypto Reserve represents a landmark policy shift. Recognizing Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano, the administration aims to fortify national financial security using blockchain assets. By endorsing digital currencies as legitimate stores of value and transaction mediums, the U.S. effectively endorses a broader altcoin rally. This move arrives just when Bitcoin’s momentum wavers. Some experts forecast a temporary dip for BTC, pointing to rising inflation pressures and possible Fed rate increases that historically dampen crypto activity. In contrast, altcoins often thrive during these transitional phases—especially when a government-driven narrative turns public attention to emerging projects. The new Reserve plan not only signals official support but also dangles the promise of regulatory clarity, reducing the risk premium for altcoin ventures. The Trump Crypto Reserve Sparks Renewed Bullish Sentiment Many credit the crypto revival to Trump’s decision to integrate major digital currencies into a national strategic reserve. The administration strengthens the market legitimacy through official asset recognition of BTC, ETH, and XRP while it creates the potential for growth from retail investors alongside institutional players. Crypto whales wonder if the spur from official acknowledgment will sustain long-term or create a short-lived crash. Skeptics warn that any hiccup—such as new tariffs or shifting macro conditions—could again dampen optimism, ushering in a classic bull trap. The announcement immediately triggered altcoins to experience an increase in valuation. Investors who have spent the recent months in inactivity now pursue substantial earnings because helpful administrative rules have recently gone into effect. The brand recognition of XRP led to its moderate price gain. Why Remittix (RTX) flourishes amid turbulence The current token value of RTX sits at $0.0694 , while it has raised close to $13.5 million from the sale of 515+ million tokens. Remittix directs its focus on resolving problems with high-cost and time-consuming cross-border money transfers. Instead of leaning on meme appeal or complex DeFi structures, RTX uses a PayFi system to quickly convert crypto to local fiat and deposit it into recipients’ bank accounts—frequently within 24 hoursThe straightforward user-friendly approach positions Remittix (RTX) as a competitive alternative to the established cross-border token XRP that has controlled this market sector for a long time. Retail workers sending money home, small firms needing to pay international suppliers, and freelancers seeking prompt settlements all stand to gain from Remittix’s near-instant transfers. The initial investors of RTX gain from locked liquidity features together with a thorough contract audit examination while receiving greater trust than various rushed presales initiatives. Its fourfold rise resulted from these fundamental principles that prevailed during the chaotic market conditions. Conclusion: A Genuine Bullrun or Hype-Fueled Trap? As the crypto market roars back thanks to Trump’s surprise announcement of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, skeptics caution that this bull run could morph into a bull trap if broader conditions deteriorate or if the administration wavers. Still, top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have all seen renewed volume and heightened speculation. In the midst of this fervor, Remittix (RTX) has managed to secure a 4x gain, backed by a straightforward solution for cross-border payments and close to $13.5 million in presale funds. For those uneasy about chasing big names weighed down by regulatory baggage, Remittix presents a strong alternative—focusing on tangible user benefits rather than hype. Whether this momentum endures hinges on how effectively the Reserve fosters mainstream adoption and how smaller, yet practical tokens like RTX manage to scale in this possibly fleeting bull environment.

Panshibi: The Presale Powerhouse Set to Soar Panshibi (SHIBI) has electrified the market, raising over $1.22 million in its presale which currently sells for $0.005 per token in Stage 4, drawing XRP holders seeking high-yield prospects. Beyond its meme coin allure, it offers staking with up to 1,200% APY and an AI-powered Social-Fi platform, distinguishing it from peers. With Trump’s reserve injecting optimism into top altcoins, Panshibi’s trajectory hints at 50x gains by April, cementing its appeal as a must-watch investment. Investors eyeing the Ripple and Solana Price rally might find Panshibi’s presale an equally compelling narrative, blending high-stakes potential with tangible ecosystem growth. The $0.005 entry price for SHIBI won’t last as each stage incrementally raises the cost, rewarding early adopters. Ripple holders’ rush to buy into Panshibi presale reflects a calculated bet on SHIBI’s future, amplified by the reserve’s market-wide uptrend. Panshibi Presale Is Closing In About 3 Weeks; Join In Now! As the USA crypto reserve takes shape, the Ripple and Solana Price surges exemplify the immediate winners with Panshibi’s presale success hinting at a greater awakening. With $1.22 million already secured, SHIBI beckons Ripple and Solana investors to join a movement poised for exponential returns.

41191165,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137125,1741182501,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary ARM Chip Deal: Malaysia’s $250M Masterplan to Dominate AI Semiconductor Manufacturing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/arm-chip-deal-malaysia-ai/,"In a revolutionary move that’s sending ripples through the global tech landscape, Malaysia is solidifying its position as a rising star in semiconductor manufacturing. As tensions simmer between tech giants like the U.S. and China, particularly concerning AI-driven technologies, the spotlight has shifted towards nations offering neutral ground and burgeoning tech ecosystems. Enter Malaysia, poised to capitalize on this global realignment, and now, sealing a game-changing ARM chip deal Malaysia . Unpacking the $250M ARM Chip Deal: A Deep Dive SoftBank-backed ARM Holdings, a titan in chip design, has officially inked a significant agreement with the Malaysian government. This isn’t just another business deal; it’s a strategic alliance aimed at supercharging Malaysia’s chip design capabilities. But what does this entail, and why is it such a big deal? Massive Investment: Malaysia is committing a substantial $250 million over the next decade to ARM. Technology Transfer: This investment isn’t just about money; it’s about acquiring cutting-edge technology. Malaysia will gain access to ARM’s intellectual property (IP), including seven crucial chip design blueprints. Boosting Local Manufacturing: The core objective is to empower local Malaysian manufacturers with ARM’s advanced chip designs and technology. Engineer Training: Crucially, ARM will also be training a whopping 10,000 Malaysian engineers, equipping them with the skills to excel in chip design using ARM’s technology. This strategic partnership underscores Malaysia’s aggressive push to become a major player in the global semiconductor industry . Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli highlighted the acquisition of seven ARM chip design blueprints as a key component of this transformative deal. While ARM remained tight-lipped about the specific $250 million figure, the agreement’s broader implications are crystal clear: Malaysia is serious about its semiconductor ambitions. Malaysia Semiconductor: A Budding Hub in Asia Why Malaysia? The nation isn’t a newcomer to the chip game. For over half a century, Malaysia semiconductor sector has been quietly contributing to the global supply chain, currently handling about 13% of the world’s chip testing, assembly, and packaging services. This existing foundation, coupled with strategic government initiatives, is turning Malaysia into a magnet for tech investment. Consider these key milestones in Malaysia’s semiconductor journey: Year Company Investment/Development 1972 Intel Established its first offshore production facility in Penang, Malaysia, investing $16 million. 2021 Intel Announced a massive $7 billion+ investment to build a new chip assembly and testing factory and its largest 3D chip packaging facility in Malaysia. 2023 GlobalFoundries Opened a new hub facility in Penang, further solidifying Malaysia’s chip manufacturing ecosystem. Future Neways (Dutch chip equipment maker) Plans to establish a new plant in Malaysia, indicating continued growth in the sector. The Malaysian government is not just relying on attracting foreign investment. It’s proactively fueling growth through its National Semiconductor Strategy (NSS), earmarking at least $5.3 billion in financial support and aiming to train 60,000 engineers. This strategy focuses on enhancing infrastructure, building an advanced chip supply chain, and attracting top-tier global clients. The AI Chips Imperative: Malaysia’s GPU Ambitions The global demand for AI chips is exploding, driven by the relentless growth of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data centers. Malaysia is keenly aware of this trend and is positioning itself to capitalize on it. Earlier this year, the nation boldly declared its intention to manufacture its own GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) specifically to meet the surging demand from AI and data center applications. This ambition aligns perfectly with the ARM deal. ARM’s chip designs are crucial for developing advanced processors, including those used in AI accelerators and GPUs. By securing ARM’s technology and training engineers in its use, Malaysia is taking concrete steps towards realizing its GPU manufacturing goals. This could potentially disrupt the current market dynamics dominated by a few key players and offer new avenues for innovation in AI hardware. Chip Design Ecosystem: Building Local Expertise The ARM partnership is a strategic masterstroke in building a robust chip design ecosystem within Malaysia. It’s not enough to simply assemble and package chips; true long-term success lies in mastering the design process itself. By acquiring ARM’s IP and investing in engineer training, Malaysia is fostering local talent and expertise in this critical area. This investment in human capital and technology transfer has several key benefits: Reduced Reliance on Foreign Expertise: Building local design capabilities reduces dependence on external expertise, fostering greater self-sufficiency. Innovation Hub: A thriving chip design ecosystem can become a hotbed for innovation, potentially leading to the development of unique chip architectures and technologies tailored to specific needs. Higher Value Jobs: Chip design roles are high-skill, high-value jobs, contributing to economic growth and technological advancement within Malaysia. Attracting Further Investment: A strong design ecosystem will attract further investment from companies seeking access to skilled talent and innovative design capabilities. Semiconductor Industry Growth: A Global Perspective Malaysia’s aggressive moves are happening against a backdrop of significant shifts in the global semiconductor industry . Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, are driving companies to diversify their supply chains and reduce reliance on any single region. Malaysia, with its long history in the industry, stable political environment, and proactive government support, is emerging as an attractive alternative. Furthermore, the investments from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia, totaling billions of dollars since 2023, primarily focused on data centers, AI development, and cloud services in Malaysia, are further validating the country’s strategic importance in the tech landscape. These investments create a synergistic effect, boosting demand for local semiconductor manufacturing and design capabilities. In conclusion, the ARM-Malaysia deal is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic partnership that could reshape the global semiconductor landscape. Malaysia’s determined push to become a chip manufacturing and design hub, fueled by government support and strategic alliances, positions it as a key player in the future of technology, particularly in the rapidly evolving world of AI. This is a space to watch closely, as Malaysia’s semiconductor ambitions unfold and potentially impact the broader tech and even cryptocurrency ecosystems through enhanced technological infrastructure and supply chain resilience.

41191166,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137126,1741182573,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Russia’s Bold Crypto Move: Greenlighting Trading for Qualified Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/russia-crypto-trading-qualified-investors/,"Is Russia about to make a significant leap into the world of cryptocurrency trading? Whispers from Moscow suggest a potential shift that could ripple through the global crypto landscape. Get ready to delve into the latest developments as Russia considers opening its doors to crypto trading, but with a twist – it’s exclusively for ‘highly qualified investors’. Let’s unpack what this could mean for the future of digital assets in Russia and beyond. Russia Crypto Trading: A New Chapter? For a while now, Russia’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been a bit of a rollercoaster. From initial skepticism to recognizing their potential, the nation’s approach has been evolving. Now, it seems they are gearing up to explore organized crypto trading Russia , albeit with a cautious and controlled approach. According to reports from the state news agency TASS, both the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank are actively engaged in discussions to launch a regulated cryptocurrency trading environment. This isn’t a free-for-all, however. The key emphasis is on an ‘experimental legal framework’ and access limited to ‘highly qualified investors’. This move signals a potentially significant shift from outright bans or heavy restrictions towards a more structured integration of digital assets within the Russian financial system. Think of it as a carefully calibrated step into the crypto world, prioritizing risk management and investor protection. Who Are These ‘Qualified Investors’ and Why Does It Matter? The phrase ‘highly qualified investors’ is central to this initiative. But what exactly does it mean in the context of crypto for qualified investors in Russia? While the specific criteria are still under wraps, it’s likely to involve factors such as: Financial Sophistication: Investors will likely need to demonstrate a strong understanding of financial markets and investment risks. Net Worth Thresholds: Expectations of substantial liquid assets or a high annual income to qualify. Investment Experience: A proven track record of successful investments in other asset classes might be a prerequisite. Why this focus on qualified investors? It boils down to risk mitigation. Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility and complexity. By limiting access to those deemed financially savvy and capable of handling potential losses, Russian authorities aim to protect less experienced retail investors from the inherent risks of the crypto market. This approach is not unique to Russia; many jurisdictions globally are grappling with how to regulate crypto in a way that fosters innovation while safeguarding consumers. Russia Cryptocurrency Regulation: Navigating the Legal Maze The path to legalizing Russia cryptocurrency regulation has been far from straightforward. For years, there’s been a push and pull between different government bodies, particularly the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank, regarding the best approach to digital assets. While the Finance Ministry has generally leaned towards regulation and legalization, the Central Bank has voiced concerns about financial stability and investor protection. This latest development suggests a potential compromise or a shift in consensus, with both entities seemingly working together on this experimental framework. Alexey Yakovlev, a Finance Ministry official, emphasized the ministry’s desire for swift implementation, provided robust risk controls are in place. This highlights the delicate balancing act Russia is attempting – embracing the potential of crypto while managing its inherent risks. Interestingly, this news comes on the heels of Russia’s previous announcement of a pilot program for cross-border cryptocurrency payments in August of last year. This earlier initiative signaled a willingness to explore the utility of crypto in international transactions, particularly in the face of sanctions and geopolitical shifts. The potential move towards regulated domestic trading could be seen as a logical next step in this broader strategy. Benefits of Crypto Trading for Russia (and Qualified Investors) Why is Russia even considering this move? What are the potential benefits of allowing crypto trading Russia , even in a limited capacity? Economic Opportunities: Legalizing and regulating crypto trading can attract investment, boost tax revenues, and foster innovation within the Russian financial sector. Circumventing Sanctions: In the current geopolitical climate, cryptocurrencies offer a potential avenue to bypass international sanctions and facilitate cross-border transactions. Technological Advancement: Embracing crypto can encourage the development of blockchain technology and related industries within Russia. Investor Demand: There is a growing global demand for cryptocurrency investments. Catering to this demand, even among qualified investors, can position Russia as a more attractive destination for capital. For qualified investors themselves, this initiative could unlock new investment opportunities within a regulated Russian market. It provides a legal and potentially safer avenue to engage with digital assets, compared to unregulated or offshore exchanges. Challenges and Considerations for Russia Digital Assets Despite the potential upsides, navigating Russia digital assets trading will not be without its challenges. Several key hurdles and considerations need to be addressed: Challenge Description Defining ‘Qualified Investor’ Establishing clear, objective, and fair criteria for who qualifies as a ‘highly qualified investor’ is crucial. The thresholds must be stringent enough to manage risk but not so restrictive as to stifle market activity. Regulatory Framework Developing a robust and comprehensive legal framework for crypto trading is essential. This includes rules around licensing, compliance, anti-money laundering (AML), and investor protection. Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Even with qualified investors, managing market risks and ensuring market stability will be a continuous challenge for regulators. Central Bank Concerns Addressing the Central Bank’s concerns about financial stability and the potential risks of crypto to the traditional financial system will be paramount for long-term success. International Scrutiny Russia’s crypto regulations will be closely watched by international bodies and other nations. Compliance with global standards and avoiding the use of crypto for illicit activities will be vital. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those keeping a close eye on the crypto space, here are some actionable insights and points to monitor as this situation unfolds: Criteria for Qualified Investors: Pay close attention to the specific criteria Russia establishes for ‘highly qualified investors’. This will indicate the scale and scope of the initial crypto trading market. Regulatory Details: The specifics of the experimental legal framework will be crucial. Look for details on licensing, permitted trading platforms, and regulatory oversight mechanisms. Central Bank Stance: Monitor the Central Bank’s pronouncements and actions. Their level of support and cooperation will be a key indicator of the initiative’s long-term viability. Market Response: Observe how the Russian and global crypto markets react to these developments. Positive market sentiment could encourage further regulatory progress. Conclusion: A Cautious but Significant Step Forward Russia’s consideration of allowing cryptocurrency Russia trading for qualified investors represents a bold , albeit measured, step towards integrating digital assets into its financial system. While the details are still emerging and challenges remain, this move signals a potential shift in approach and a recognition of the growing importance of crypto in the global financial landscape. By focusing on risk management and a controlled experimental framework, Russia appears to be cautiously exploring the opportunities that cryptocurrencies offer, while prioritizing investor protection and financial stability. The world will be watching closely to see how this experiment unfolds and what it means for the future of crypto regulation globally.

Those meme-altcoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu did not get mentioned, perhaps due to suspicion of them encouraging speculation as much as use. Senator Cynthia Lummis's Bitcoin-focused road map plans still a less-is-more framework leaning toward more usability and use. But meme coin critics reply that community-driven tokens contribute unique cultural worth. Dogecoin, for instance, briefly soared on celebrity endorsements and meme-driven viral popularity. Shiba Inu also charmed everyday traders seeking to profit handsomely. Despite the dismissal, new trends indicate meme coins could be on the verge of another gigantic move—especially if network advancements and user interest converge. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin That Refuses To Fade Shiba Inu is also one of the top-performing meme coins, worth around $0.00001308 with a $7.74 billion market capitalization. Its April Ethereum upgrade is viewed as a likely mover for Shiba Inu, with uKastlFatu's Twitter message bringing out anticipations for a good impact on transactions. Although Shiba Inu leverages much of its fame with viral hype, it's developed its ecosystem slowly through advances like staking and decentralized exchanges. Skeptics continue to ask if Shiba Inu will be successful at duplicating its previous meteoric rise. However, meme coin rallies have a way of mystifying, paving the way for renewed activity if the Ethereum upgrade increases the use and profile of Shiba Inu. PEPE: Another Meme Token On The Rise PEPE has burst into the spotlight with a 5.25% one-day increase, pushing its price to $0.056944. Its market cap is now $2.92 billion, while trading volume rose to $1.1 billion in 24 hours. The next meme coin sensation, some investors believe, is PEPE, with an example being the high demand for the internet frog and the increasing social media following of the token. Like Shiba Inu, PEPE is dependent on viral traction. If it keeps seeing high engagement, the coin can see more price appreciation. However, meme tokens live and die based on the moods of internet opinion. A single slip or shift in trending topics can kill interest as fast as it emerges. For investors, it is a question of whether PEPE can move beyond hype and build more lasting value than temporary online fads. Remittix: The Altcoin Tipped To Be The Next XRP As Shiba Inu and PEPE make headlines with their meme-fueled gains, Remittix is winning over those starved for utility in the real world. At $0.0694, the project has sold over 513 million tokens and raised almost $13.5 million. It offers PayFi, an approach that balances blockchain efficiency with the real-world ease of traditional banking rails. Picture a Southeast Asian freelance designer receiving payment in crypto from North American clients that Remittix simply exchanges into local fiat with no hidden costs or frustrating wire delays. Small businesses importing goods would enjoy similar benefits, circumventing complex remittance chains. The open, straightforward service model contrasts directly with Shiba Inu's meme-led rallies, looking instead to adoption over the longer term on global markets. Remittix's user-friendly dashboard demystifies crypto, providing a credible alternative to those who would otherwise avoid digital assets. With traction, Remittix is the next XRP in cross-border liquidity, according to analysts. Most meme coins are novelty, but Remittix is about solving actual financial issues in the real world. By bridging payment gaps and bypassing institutional hurdles, it taps into a gigantic remittance market of hundreds of billions of dollars annually. See the Remittix presale to find out if PayFi can transform cross-border payments. As fans scream ""Make Meme Coins Great Again"" for PEPE and Shiba Inu, Remittix places a bet on useful integration—potentially becoming the basis of future crypto payments.

While global economic forecasts painted a different picture, the Baht’s unexpected Baht surge has become a captivating story of defying expectations. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors keen on understanding global financial undercurrents, the Baht’s performance offers valuable insights into market dynamics and the power of unforeseen economic factors. Let’s dive deep into what’s driving this phenomenon and what it means for the broader financial landscape. What’s Behind the Unexpected Baht Surge? The Thai Baht’s recent performance is not just a minor fluctuation; it’s a significant upward trend that contradicts prevailing predictions. For months, analysts anticipated a weakening Baht due to various global economic pressures, including concerns over tourism recovery, export competitiveness, and regional economic slowdowns. However, the reality has been strikingly different. The Baht has not only held its ground but has actually strengthened, outperforming many of its regional peers and even some major global currencies. Several factors are contributing to this unexpected Baht surge : Robust Tourism Rebound: Thailand’s tourism sector, a cornerstone of its economy, is experiencing a vigorous recovery. The influx of tourists, particularly from regions less affected by global economic downturns, is injecting significant foreign currency into the Thai economy, bolstering demand for the Baht. Strong Export Performance in Specific Sectors: While overall global trade faces headwinds, certain sectors within Thailand’s export economy are showing surprising strength. Demand for specific Thai goods, potentially in electronics, agriculture, or niche manufacturing, could be exceeding expectations and supporting the Baht. Capital Inflows and Investment: Thailand might be attracting more foreign investment than anticipated. This could be due to factors like perceived stability in the Thai economy compared to other emerging markets, attractive investment opportunities, or strategic geographical positioning within Asia. These inflows naturally increase demand for the Baht. Effective Monetary Policy: The Bank of Thailand’s (BOT) monetary policy decisions could be playing a crucial role. Prudent interest rate management and other policy tools might be making the Baht more attractive to hold and invest in, especially in a volatile global environment. Reduced Political Uncertainty: Compared to some periods in the past, Thailand is currently experiencing a phase of relative political stability. This can boost investor confidence and contribute to a stronger currency. Why are Analysts Baffled by the Thai Baht Strength? The bewilderment among analysts stems from the fact that traditional economic models and forecasts did not foresee this level of Thai Baht strength . Many models likely overemphasized the negative global economic factors and underestimated the resilience of the Thai economy and the effectiveness of its domestic policies. Here’s a breakdown of why the Baht’s performance is considered so surprising: Global Economic Headwinds: The prevailing narrative has been one of global economic slowdown, inflation concerns, and potential recession in major economies. In such a climate, emerging market currencies are generally expected to weaken against stronger currencies like the US Dollar. The Baht’s defiance of this trend is a major surprise. Regional Currency Performance: Many other Southeast Asian currencies have been under pressure due to similar global economic factors. The Baht’s outperformance relative to its neighbors adds to the puzzle. Analysts are questioning why Thailand is weathering the storm so much better than anticipated. Data Discrepancies: Traditional economic indicators might not be fully capturing the nuances of the Thai economy in the current environment. There could be underlying factors or shifts in economic activity that are not immediately apparent in standard datasets, leading to forecasting errors. Behavioral Economics and Market Sentiment: Currency markets are not solely driven by rational economic factors. Market sentiment, investor psychology, and herd behavior can play significant roles. It’s possible that positive sentiment towards the Thai economy, perhaps fueled by early signs of tourism recovery or positive news in specific sectors, has created a self-fulfilling prophecy of Baht strength. How Does Thai Baht Strength Impact the Forex Market? The Thai Baht strength has notable implications for the broader Forex market analysis and global currency dynamics: Impact Area Description Regional Currency Benchmarking The Baht’s strength serves as a benchmark for other Southeast Asian currencies. Its performance prompts analysts to reassess the factors influencing regional currency valuations and to look for similar dynamics in neighboring economies. Emerging Markets Currency Dynamics The Baht’s resilience challenges the narrative of uniform weakness in emerging markets currency . It highlights the importance of country-specific factors and policy responses in determining currency performance, even amidst global economic challenges. Forex Trading Strategies Traders and investors in the Forex market analysis need to adjust their strategies to account for unexpected currency movements like the Baht’s surge. Traditional models might need to be recalibrated to incorporate these surprising trends. Global Portfolio Diversification The Baht’s performance can influence global portfolio diversification strategies. Investors seeking exposure to Asian currencies might view the Baht as a potentially more stable or resilient option than previously perceived, leading to shifts in investment flows. Is the Thai Baht Strength a Sign of Emerging Markets Currency Power? While the Thai Baht strength is certainly noteworthy, it’s crucial to avoid broad generalizations about emerging markets currency power based solely on one currency’s performance. The Baht’s surge is likely driven by a unique combination of factors specific to the Thai economy. However, it does offer some broader lessons and insights: Country-Specific Resilience Matters: The Baht’s case underscores that individual emerging economies can exhibit surprising resilience even when facing global headwinds. Strong domestic fundamentals, effective policy responses, and unique economic structures can allow certain countries to outperform expectations. Diversification within Emerging Markets: The Forex market and investment strategies should always consider the diversity within emerging markets. Treating all emerging market currencies as a homogenous group can be misleading. The Baht’s divergence from regional trends highlights the importance of granular analysis. Potential Shift in Global Economic Power Dynamics: While it’s too early to declare a major shift, the Baht’s strength, along with the performance of other select emerging market economies, could signal a gradual rebalancing of global economic power. If emerging economies can demonstrate greater resilience and growth potential, their currencies might gain increasing prominence in the global financial system over time. What’s Next for the Thai Baht and the Global Economy? The future trajectory of the Thai Baht strength and its broader implications remain to be seen. Several key factors will influence its performance moving forward: Sustainability of Tourism Recovery: The continued strength of the Baht is heavily reliant on the sustained recovery of Thailand’s tourism sector. Any setbacks in tourism, whether due to global economic slowdowns, new travel restrictions, or other unforeseen events, could weaken the Baht. Global Economic Conditions: While Thailand has shown resilience, it is not immune to global economic trends. A significant global recession or a sharp downturn in major trading partners’ economies would inevitably impact the Thai economy and potentially pressure the Baht. Bank of Thailand Policy: The BOT’s future monetary policy decisions will be crucial. Balancing inflation control, economic growth, and currency stability will be a delicate act. Any shifts in policy direction could significantly impact the Baht’s value. Geopolitical Factors: Global geopolitical events and regional stability also play a role. Unexpected geopolitical shocks could create volatility in currency markets and impact investor sentiment towards the Baht. For cryptocurrency investors and those following global financial markets, the Baht vs Dollar exchange rate and the broader performance of the Thai Baht are worth monitoring closely. The Baht’s unexpected strength serves as a potent reminder that market dynamics are constantly evolving and that conventional wisdom can be challenged by unforeseen events and underlying economic shifts. In conclusion, the shocking Thai Baht strength is a compelling narrative of resilience and surprise in the global Forex market. It underscores the importance of nuanced analysis, country-specific factors, and the ever-present potential for markets to defy expectations. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the Baht’s journey will undoubtedly offer valuable lessons and insights for investors, analysts, and anyone seeking to understand the complexities of international finance.

41191271,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137132,1741182822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Contentious Crypto Clash: Bybit Demands Paraswap Return Fees from Lazarus Group Hack – A DeFi Governance Dilemma,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-paraswap-lazarus-defi-governance/,"In a fascinating turn of events in the crypto world, leading crypto exchange Bybit has officially requested DeFi protocol Paraswap to return fees amounting to 44.67 wETH. This sum, valued at approximately $100,000, was earned by Paraswap from swaps that are allegedly linked to the infamous Lazarus Group’s audacious hack on Bybit. This bold proposal has ignited a vigorous debate within the Paraswap Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), highlighting a fundamental tension within the DeFi space. Let’s dive into this contentious situation and understand the core issues at play. Why is Crypto Exchange Bybit Asking for the Return of Fees? The request from crypto exchange Bybit is rooted in the aftermath of a security breach attributed to the Lazarus Group, a notorious cybercriminal organization with alleged ties to North Korea. Following the hack, Bybit traced some of the stolen funds moving through the DeFi ecosystem, eventually leading to swaps executed on Paraswap. While Paraswap itself was not compromised, it inadvertently processed transactions involving illicitly obtained funds and, as a result, earned fees from these swaps. Bybit argues that these fees are essentially proceeds of crime and should be returned. To put it simply, Bybit’s perspective is: Stolen Funds: Lazarus Group hacked Bybit and stole cryptocurrency. Funds Traced: Some stolen funds were used for swaps on Paraswap. Paraswap Earned Fees: Paraswap collected transaction fees from these swaps. Ethical Obligation: Bybit believes Paraswap should return these fees due to their origin in a criminal act. This situation raises a critical question: Does a DeFi protocol have an ethical or even legal obligation to return fees earned from transactions linked to criminal activity, even if the protocol itself was not involved in the crime? The DeFi Governance Dilemma: Code is Law vs. Industry Solidarity The proposal has thrown the Paraswap DAO into a complex DeFi governance dilemma. On one side, there’s the argument for industry solidarity and responsible behavior. Proponents of returning the funds emphasize that: Industry Reputation: Returning the fees would demonstrate a commitment to ethical conduct within the crypto space and enhance the reputation of both Paraswap and the broader DeFi sector. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ignoring such requests could attract negative attention from regulators, who are increasingly concerned about illicit activities in crypto. Cooperating could be seen as a proactive step towards compliance and responsible innovation. Moral Imperative: Some DAO members believe there’s a moral obligation to not profit from criminal activities, even indirectly. Keeping the fees could be perceived as condoning or benefiting from the Lazarus Group hack. However, a significant portion of the Paraswap DAO is pushing back, citing DeFi’s core principle: “code is law.” Their arguments revolve around: Code is Law: This principle asserts that smart contracts execute exactly as programmed, and there’s no room for subjective interpretation or intervention after the fact. Paraswap’s code functioned as intended, processing transactions and collecting fees. Dangerous Precedent: Returning the fees could set a dangerous precedent, potentially opening the floodgates for similar requests in the future. Where do you draw the line? If Paraswap returns fees this time, what prevents other exchanges or victims of crime from demanding fee returns whenever illicit funds are traced through DeFi protocols? Immutability and Decentralization: Demanding retroactive changes based on off-chain events undermines the immutability and decentralized nature of DeFi. It could create uncertainty and erode trust in the system. Past Precedent: A similar situation arose in 2013 where Paraswap (or its predecessor) refused to return processing fees in a comparable scenario. Some DAO members are referencing this historical precedent as a reason to maintain consistency and deny Bybit’s request. This clash of ideologies – industry solidarity versus the rigid application of “code is law” – perfectly encapsulates the ongoing evolution of DeFi governance and its grappling with real-world ethical and legal complexities. Lazarus Group Hack: Understanding the Scale and Impact To fully grasp the context of Bybit’s request, it’s essential to understand the nature of the Lazarus Group hack . The Lazarus Group is a sophisticated cybercriminal organization believed to be linked to North Korea. They are notorious for carrying out large-scale cyberattacks, often targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to generate revenue for the North Korean regime. Key aspects of the Lazarus Group and their activities include: Aspect Description Attribution Widely attributed to North Korea, although direct confirmation is often difficult to obtain. Targets Financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, government agencies, and critical infrastructure. Motivations Primarily financial gain to support the North Korean regime, but also espionage and disruption. Tactics Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), phishing, malware, social engineering, and supply chain attacks. Impact Billions of dollars stolen, significant financial losses for victims, and reputational damage. The hack on crypto exchange Bybit is just one instance in a long history of Lazarus Group’s cybercriminal activities. These attacks not only cause direct financial harm but also undermine trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and raise concerns about security and regulation. Analyzing the Crypto Fees in Question: Is $100,000 Significant? The amount of crypto fees in question, 44.67 wETH (approximately $100,000), while significant, is relatively small in the context of major crypto hacks and the overall scale of DeFi transactions. However, the principle at stake is far more important than the monetary value. The debate is not just about $100,000; it’s about setting a precedent for how DeFi protocols should respond to illicit funds and criminal activities. Consider these points regarding the crypto fees : Symbolic Value: Even if $100,000 is a small fraction of Paraswap’s total revenue, returning it could send a powerful message about ethical conduct and industry responsibility. Precedent Setting: The decision in this case will likely influence future similar situations. A positive outcome for Bybit could encourage other victims to seek fee returns from DeFi protocols. A negative outcome could embolden those who argue for absolute adherence to “code is law,” regardless of ethical considerations. DAO Governance: This situation serves as a crucial test case for Paraswap’s DAO governance model. It will demonstrate how effectively the DAO can balance competing interests, ethical considerations, and the principles of DeFi. What are the Potential Outcomes and Actionable Insights? The Paraswap DAO is currently deliberating on Bybit’s proposal. Several outcomes are possible: Return of Fees: The DAO could vote to return the 44.67 wETH to Bybit. This would be seen as a victory for industry solidarity and ethical considerations, but could potentially set a precedent that some DAO members fear. Rejection of Proposal: The DAO could vote to reject Bybit’s proposal, citing “code is law” and the precedent argument. This would uphold the principle of immutability but could damage Paraswap’s reputation and attract negative scrutiny. Compromise Solution: The DAO might seek a compromise, such as donating an equivalent amount to a charity focused on cybercrime victims or contributing to a fund that supports blockchain security research. This could be a middle ground that addresses ethical concerns without directly contradicting the “code is law” principle. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community: Enhanced Security Measures: This incident underscores the importance of robust security measures for all crypto exchanges and DeFi protocols to prevent hacks and illicit fund flows. Clearer Governance Frameworks: DeFi projects need to develop clearer governance frameworks that address ethical dilemmas and potential conflicts between “code is law” and real-world responsibilities. Industry Collaboration: Increased collaboration between centralized exchanges and DeFi protocols is crucial for combating cybercrime and ensuring the integrity of the crypto ecosystem. Regulatory Dialogue: Open dialogue with regulators is essential to establish a balanced regulatory framework that fosters innovation while mitigating risks and addressing illicit activities. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for DeFi The DeFi protocol Paraswap ‘s decision on Bybit’s request is more than just a vote on returning $100,000 in fees. It represents a defining moment for the DeFi space, forcing a critical examination of its values, principles, and responsibilities. The outcome will likely have far-reaching implications for DeFi governance , industry ethics, and the future relationship between decentralized protocols and centralized entities in the crypto exchange Bybit and wider ecosystem. As the debate continues, the crypto community watches closely, eager to see how this Lazarus Group hack fallout will reshape the landscape of decentralized finance and the handling of crypto fees derived from illicit activities.

With a decentralized lending model that provides real utility, MUTM stands out as more than just another token—it offers a structured financial ecosystem where users can earn, borrow, and access liquidity. As the presale continues gaining traction, analysts believe that MUTM’s strong fundamentals could make it one of the most profitable altcoin investments in the coming year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is more than just another altcoin—it’s a fully functional lending and borrowing platform designed to streamline access to liquidity in the DeFi sector. Unlike speculative tokens that rely purely on market sentiment, MUTM has a structured financial use case that encourages continuous engagement from both lenders and borrowers. Users who supply assets into the protocol earn competitive yields through a model that rewards participation based on liquidity demand. At the same time, borrowers can access funds without selling their crypto holdings, maintaining their exposure to potential market gains. This setup creates a sustainable demand cycle, reinforcing the value of the token as more users engage with the platform. Mutuum Finance has already captured strong early interest, with its presale raising over $2 million. In the first phase alone, 110 million tokens sold out, signaling high confidence from investors. Now in its second phase, the price remains attractive for those looking to secure an early position before wider adoption increases demand. With MUTM currently priced at $0.015, many investors see this as an ideal entry point, especially as DeFi lending platforms gain more traction. The steady increase in participation suggests that Mutuum Finance is positioning itself for significant expansion, making it an asset worth watching.

The platform supports both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, allowing for diverse financial interactions. In P2C lending, users deposit assets into smart contract-based liquidity pools, earning interest that compounds over time. This system benefits lenders by ensuring continuous passive income, while borrowers can access liquidity in a transparent and efficient manner. Meanwhile, the P2P model enables direct loan agreements, allowing users to negotiate terms based on market conditions. This feature supports a wider range of assets, including meme tokens like DOGE and SHIB, providing an additional layer of flexibility. Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway to reward its growing community and early supporters. The prize pool will be distributed among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This initiative not only encourages participation but also strengthens investor confidence as the project gains momentum. With increasing interest in the presale, the giveaway serves as an additional incentive for those looking to get involved early. Why This Could Be One of 2025’s Most Profitable Investments With its growing adoption, clear financial use case, and expanding ecosystem, Mutuum Finance is proving to be more than just another altcoin. Investors looking for projects with real functionality are beginning to take notice, with some calling it one of the most promising DeFi investments of the year. As the presale continues to gain momentum, those securing early positions stand to benefit from Mutuum’s long-term vision. With an increasing number of investors shifting toward utility-driven projects, MUTM is emerging as a strong contender in the evolving DeFi space, making it an asset to watch in 2025 and beyond.

The move comes as Vietnam tries to pursue measures that stimulate and stabilise the economy. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) have been asked to complete the task. Chinh has requested a draft of the legal framework by the end of the month Cryptocurrency in Vietnam is currently not seen as legal tender. Many people who use crypto register their tokens overseas. As a result, Vietnam loses much tax revenue by not capitalising on the popularity of digital assets. Further, crypto companies in Vietnam are disadvantaged on the global stage by having government backing. The prime minister claims that a regulatory framework is popular amongst Vietnamese citizens. The prime minister recently signed Directive No. 5, which aims to achieve 8% national growth by 2025. The crypto proposal forms part of this larger strategy to establish a legal framework for digital currencies. “The Party has directed”, wrote Tuoi Tre, government head, “the Government has agreed, the National Assembly has agreed, the People have supported, and the Fatherland has expected. So just discuss to action, not to retreat”. The prime minister’s directive was issued on Saturday. The Finance Ministry will be in charge of executing the project. The project will be fast-paced due to the urgency of creating a legal framework for a growing industry and supporting more business innovation in Vietnam. Nguyen Duy Hung, chairman of Saigon Securities Inc., mentioned that Vietnam ranks fourth in cryptocurrency transaction volume, making it one of the leaders in digital asset adoption and innovation. He further started that a legal framework would protect consumers and entrepreneurs so that they could enjoy the benefits of technological innovation. The framework, he further reasoned, would deter criminal activity and scam tokens. Vietnam further ranks fifth in terms of crypto adoption, according to the 2024 blockchain report by Chainalysis. The report further stated that around 17 million people in Vietnam currently own cryptocurrencies and that Vietnamese crypto holders earned around $1 billion in 2023. Nguyen Duy Hung further mentioned that the top ten crypto exchanges in the world acknowledge the enormous transaction volume coming from Vietnam. However, he concedes that entrepreneurs do not feel secure in the crypto industry because they have no legal framework to protect their business interests.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Vietnam,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-05 13:54:20

The security flaw affects the popular “elliptic” library that provides elliptic curve cryptography functions for several cryptocurrency wallets, identity systems, and Web3 applications. According to SlowMist’s analysis , the vulnerability comes from the library’s flawed handling of non-standard inputs during signature operations. This flow can lead to repeated random numbers in ECDSA signatures. Since the security of these signatures depends entirely on the uniqueness of these random values, any repetition allows attackers to mathematically derive the private key. Vulnerability allows private key extraction with minimal interaction The reason for the flaw is in how the elliptic library generates what cryptographers call the “k value.” This is a random number that should never be reused across different signatures. SlowMist’s analysis reveals that attackers can craft specific inputs that trick the library into reusing this value. “When generating k, the private key and message are used as seeds to ensure uniqueness under different inputs,” explains SlowMist’s report. This flaw creates a dangerous attack vector because it needs minimal interaction with victims. An attacker only needs to observe one legitimate signature and then trick the target into signing a specially crafted message. By comparing these two signatures, the attacker can mathematically derive the victim’s private key using a relatively simple formula. Widespread adoption puts numerous Web3 applications at risk The usage of the elliptic library by the JavaScript community makes the potential impact of the vulnerability greater. SlowMist indicates that the vulnerability is present in all versions up to 6.6.0 and affects applications using various elliptic curves. Any application that does ECDSA signatures on externally supplied input is at risk. This could include cryptocurrency wallets, decentralized finance apps, NFT platforms, and Web3-based identity authentication apps. The library utilization in the digital currency space comes with an attack surface. If the private key is compromised, the attackers then have full control over the corresponding assets. The hackers can perform unauthorized transfers, alter ownership records, or impersonate users in decentralized apps. SlowMist has also posted some emergency suggestions for users and developers to mitigate the security threat. Developers should first of all update the elliptic library to version 6.6.1 or above since the vulnerability has been officially addressed in the most recent release. Apart from refreshing the library, SlowMist recommends developers include further security precautions within their apps. For the affected app users, the biggest concern is whether their private keys might already be at risk. SlowMist recommends that users who have possibly signed malicious or unknown messages should take the precaution of replacing their private keys. Phishing attacks subside as technical vulnerabilities take center stage Although SlowMist’s find indicates threats from tech vulnerabilities, figures from Scam Sniffer indicate that conventional phishing attacks have dropped for three straight months. In February 2025, $5.32 million was lost by 7,442 victims. This represents a 48% drop from January’s $10.25 million and a 77% fall from December’s $23.58 million. 🧵 [1/4] 🚨 ScamSniffer February 2025 Phishing Report February losses: $5.32M | 7,442 victims January losses: $10.25M | 9,220 victims (-48% MoM) pic.twitter.com/HsZZSlYKJC — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) March 5, 2025 While this downward trend is apparent, a number of attack vectors are still extremely potent.

The cryptocurrency has gained more than 8% in the last 24 hours and is eyeing higher levels. President Donald Trump is set to announce a major shift in cryptocurrency policy this week, including plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve. This move, confirmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is part of a broader strategy to regulate and position the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets. In an interview with The Pavlovic Today , Lutnick said, “The President definitely thinks that there’s a Bitcoin strategic reserve. A Bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President’s interested in. He spoke about it all during the campaign trail, and I think you’re going to see it executed on Friday. So Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently—positively, but differently.” This announcement comes after Trump outlined his stance on a U.S. crypto reserve in a post on Truth Social. The White House Crypto Summit, scheduled for Friday, will be a key event in the administration’s efforts to create regulatory clarity and promote financial innovation within the cryptocurrency space. This summit follows Executive Order 14178, signed during Trump’s first week in office, which committed his administration to the responsible growth and use of digital assets. The summit will bring together key figures from the crypto industry to discuss the future of regulation and economic opportunities in the digital asset space.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-05 13:58:01

In this case, Ali Martinez pointed out that, based on a key technical pattern, if Solana drops below the critical $125 support level, it might trigger a slide all the way to $60, according to his insight in an X post on March 5. SOL price analysis chart. Source: Ali_charts Martinez explained that since March 2024, Solana has been moving within a right-angled, ascending broadening formation, a setup with a flat support line and a rising resistance trendline. This pattern often hints at growing volatility and the chance of a big drop if support gives way. He noted that every time Solana hits a new high, it runs into resistance along that ascending trendline, forming the pattern’s upper edge. So far, the $125 level has held firm as a floor, keeping losses in check. But if that support breaks, Martinez warned, a sharp fall to $60 could be on the horizon. Therefore, if Solana slips below $125, selling pressure might kick into high gear, dragging the asset into bearish territory. Solana’s price bullish potential On the flip side, a pseudonymous analyst, Mister Crypto , shared a more upbeat take in an X post on March 4. He argued that Solana is showing strong bullish signs, forming an ascending wedge pattern that could set the stage for a breakout. His analysis pointed to three clear upward surges, with gains of 63%, 100%, and 110%, respectively. This setup resembles a classic “Three Drives” pattern, often signaling a big upward move. SOL price analysis chart. Source: Mister Crypto Right now, SOL is testing the upper edge of that wedge. A break above it could spark a rally to fresh highs. As it stands, Solana is trying to bounce back after struggling to gain traction following its inclusion in President Donald Trump’s strategic crypto reserve . Like the broader market, Solana took a hit from a widespread capital outflow affecting stocks and crypto. Still, according to a Finbold report, trading analyst Trader Tardigrade predicted Solana could climb past $500, while the AI platform ChatGPT sees SOL struggling to crack $200 in March. SOL price analysis At the time of reporting, SOL was trading at $146.64, up over 7% in 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has also gained 7% over the past week. SOL seven-day price chart.

Technical indicators present a mixed picture with the 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) sits at $202.38, well above the current price, while the 200-day SMA at $187.46 highlights the asset’s struggle to regain momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 40.88 suggests the market is nearing oversold territory, potentially hinting at a buying opportunity.

41191490,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137185,1741183221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unleashed AI Innovation: UK Authority Greenlights Microsoft OpenAI Partnership,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uk-cma-microsoft-openai-partnership/,"In a powerful move for the artificial intelligence landscape, the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced its decision regarding the much-scrutinized partnership between tech giant Microsoft and AI innovator OpenAI. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, regulatory clarity is always welcome, and this decision provides a significant signal about the future of AI development and investment in the UK. After a period of review initiated in December 2023, the CMA has determined that the collaboration does not currently warrant a full-scale investigation under the UK’s Enterprise Act 2002. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it a noteworthy development? Decoding the UK Competition Authority’s Decision on the AI Partnership The core of this news revolves around the UK competition authority , the CMA, and its role in ensuring fair competition within the British market. When companies merge or form significant partnerships, especially in rapidly evolving sectors like AI, the CMA steps in to assess whether these arrangements could potentially stifle competition. In the case of Microsoft and OpenAI, the concern was centered around Microsoft’s substantial investment—nearly $14 billion—and deep integration with OpenAI’s technologies. Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects of the CMA’s process and decision: Initial Scrutiny: The CMA initiated a preliminary inquiry in December 2023 to understand the nature and scope of the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership. This is a standard procedure to determine if a deeper investigation is necessary. Merger Provisions and the Enterprise Act 2002: The CMA’s review was conducted under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002. This legislation empowers the CMA to investigate mergers or partnerships that could lead to a ‘substantial lessening of competition’ within the UK. No Qualification for Investigation: Crucially, the CMA has concluded that, based on the information available, the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership does not currently qualify for a Phase 2 investigation. This signifies that, at this stage, the CMA does not believe the partnership raises sufficient concerns about anti-competitive practices to warrant a more in-depth probe. Future Watchfulness: While the current partnership is cleared, the CMA has indicated it will continue to monitor developments in the AI sector. This suggests ongoing vigilance regarding potential shifts in the competitive landscape as AI technologies evolve. In essence, the CMA’s decision is a vote of confidence in the current structure of the AI partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI. It signals that regulators, at least in the UK, are not immediately concerned about this particular collaboration hindering competition. Why is the CMA Decision on Microsoft and OpenAI Significant for AI Regulation? This decision is more than just a procedural clearance; it carries weight for several reasons, particularly in the context of evolving AI regulation globally. Let’s explore why this development matters: Precedent Setting: This case is closely watched as a potential precedent for how regulatory bodies worldwide might approach partnerships between major tech companies and leading AI developers. The CMA’s approach could influence similar assessments in other jurisdictions. Balancing Innovation and Competition: The decision reflects a delicate balancing act between fostering innovation in the rapidly growing AI sector and ensuring a level playing field. Overly stringent regulation could stifle innovation, while insufficient oversight could lead to market dominance and reduced consumer choice. Clarity for Tech Investment: The CMA’s clearance provides a degree of regulatory certainty for Microsoft, OpenAI, and other companies considering similar collaborations in AI. This clarity can encourage further investment and development in the field, knowing that partnerships are not automatically viewed as anti-competitive. Focus on ‘Substantial Lessening of Competition’: The CMA’s finding that the partnership doesn’t ‘qualify for investigation’ highlights the threshold for regulatory intervention. It suggests that partnerships, even significant ones, may be permissible as long as they don’t demonstrably and substantially reduce competition in the market. For the cryptocurrency world, which often intersects with AI through applications like algorithmic trading and blockchain analytics, this news is indirectly positive. A healthy and innovative AI ecosystem, facilitated by clear regulatory frameworks, can lead to advancements that benefit various technology sectors, including crypto. Understanding the Implications of the CMA’s Judgement The CMA decision not to investigate the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership further has several implications for the involved parties and the broader tech landscape: Implication Description For Microsoft and OpenAI: Allows them to continue their deep collaboration without the immediate threat of regulatory intervention in the UK. This provides stability and confidence for ongoing and future projects. For AI Innovation: Signals a relatively permissive regulatory environment in the UK for AI partnerships, potentially encouraging further collaborations and investments in AI research and development. For Competitors: May raise concerns among competitors who might feel disadvantaged by the Microsoft-OpenAI alliance. However, the CMA’s decision suggests that the partnership, in its current form, is not deemed unfairly anti-competitive. For Future Regulatory Scrutiny: Sets a benchmark for future assessments of AI partnerships. It indicates that regulators are carefully evaluating these arrangements but are not automatically opposed to them, focusing instead on demonstrable impacts on competition. It’s crucial to remember that this is not a blanket approval for all AI partnerships. The CMA explicitly stated that its decision is based on the current nature of the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship and that they will continue to monitor the sector. Future developments, changes in market dynamics, or shifts in the partnership’s structure could trigger further scrutiny. Looking Ahead: The Future of AI Partnerships and Regulation As AI continues to permeate various aspects of our lives, the question of AI partnership models and their regulation will only become more critical. The CMA’s decision in this case offers some initial insights into how regulators might approach these complex relationships. Here are some key takeaways and forward-looking perspectives: Dynamic Regulatory Landscape: Expect AI regulation to remain a dynamic and evolving area. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are grappling with how to foster innovation while mitigating potential risks and ensuring fair competition. Case-by-Case Assessments: The CMA’s approach suggests a preference for case-by-case assessments of AI partnerships, rather than broad, sweeping restrictions. This allows for nuanced evaluations that consider the specific details of each collaboration and its potential impact on the market. Importance of Transparency: Companies engaging in AI partnerships should prioritize transparency and open communication with regulatory bodies. Proactive engagement can help address potential concerns and facilitate smoother regulatory processes. Global Regulatory Coordination: Given the global nature of the AI industry, international cooperation and coordination among regulatory agencies will be increasingly important to ensure consistent and effective oversight. In conclusion, the UK CMA’s decision not to investigate the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership is a significant development in the evolving narrative of AI regulation. It signals a balanced approach that seeks to encourage innovation while remaining vigilant about competitive fairness. For the cryptocurrency and broader tech communities, this news offers a glimpse into the future of AI development – a future where strategic partnerships can flourish under thoughtful, adaptable regulatory frameworks.

Weekly RSI Drops Below 50%, Raising Alarm",https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-bearish-rsi-shift/,"SUI, one of the most closely watched cryptocurrencies, is flashing warning signs as its weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) dips below the critical 50% threshold, bringing the cryptocurrency to the $2.36 significant support level. This key technical indicator, often used to gauge market momentum, suggests a potential shift in sentiment from bullish to bearish. With the RSI now signaling weakening buying pressure, investors are left wondering: Is this the beginning of a prolonged downturn for SUI? SUI’s Weekly RSI Breakdown: A Sign Of Weakening Momentum SUI’s recent drop in its weekly RSI below the key 50% threshold signals a shift in momentum, raising concerns among traders and investors. The RSI decline below 50% usually suggests weakening buying pressure and growing bearish dominance. This breakdown could indicate that sellers are gaining control, potentially leading to increased volatility and further downside risks. Related Reading: SUI Bearish Grip Tightens As Price Eyes $2.8 Retest Amid Market Pressure For SUI, this development is particularly significant since the cryptocurrency, which has enjoyed periods of strong upward movement, now faces the risk of a bearish reversal. The RSI breakdown indicates that the market’s enthusiasm for SUI may be waning, possibly opening the door for extended declines. Moreover, SUI’s price has now fallen below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, signaling a weakening bullish structure. Thus, selling pressure has intensified, making it more challenging for buyers to regain control. If the price fails to reclaim this critical level, the bearish momentum could persist, driving the asset toward deeper support zones and confirming a prolonged correction. Should the RSI remain on a downward trajectory, it could pave the way for a decisive drop below the $2.36 support level. This breakdown may accelerate selling pressure, driving SUI toward lower support zones at $1.59 and $1.42, reinforcing the bearish outlook. What’s Next? Key Triggers That Could Drive A Recovery For SUI to regain bullish momentum, several key triggers must align to drive a potential recovery. A strong bounce from key support levels, particularly near $2.56 or $1.42, might signal that buyers are stepping in to defend the price. When this happens, selling pressure is expected to ease, paving the way for a reversal. Related Reading: SUI In Bear Territory: RSI Drop Suggests Further Downside Risk Another crucial element to watch is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, which SUI has recently fallen below. A decisive move back above this level would suggest renewed bullish strength and serve as an early sign of recovery. Additionally, an upside move is likely once the RSI starts forming a bullish divergence. Broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors will play a key role in SUI’s recovery. A shift in Bitcoin’s trend or overall crypto market momentum could drive a rebound, allowing SUI to challenge resistance levels at $2.82 and $3.50.

To read full editions, subscribe . Unlike what I’m seeing on CT, I don’t need to convince any of y’all that crypto looks good in the long term. You all know this because, dang, we’ve never been in such a bullish position (stop looking at current price action, and close the tab please). Ryan Connor of Blockworks Research says we’re seeing fundamentals play a role in crypto. And if that sounds familiar, it’s because he said a similar thing literally a month ago . There are a few examples of this — get ready for some alpha — but my big takeaway is that we’re starting to see some parts of crypto act like stocks. And it’s really kicking off, more so than what we discussed last month. Who said crypto doesn’t trade on fundamentals? https://t.co/bhsSSnHAZ8 — Ryan Connor | BWR 🟪 (@_ryanrconnor) March 4, 2025 Geodnet is one such example, Connor said. His team at Blockworks Research has been “pounding the table” on it since November because “they’re building out an RTK network globally. It’s seeing real revenue. It’s seeing ARR revenue. That revenue is steadily climbing up … it is completely untethered from this self-reflective crypto capital market,” he explained. Most importantly: It hasn’t moved on crypto volatility in the past few months. For Connor, that’s perhaps the most important snippet because it shows that folks aren’t taking profit just because of the current market conditions and reaffirms the “fundamental story.” Grass is another such example. It’s a “business that’s not correlated to crypto capital markets, and that thing’s up 20-40% since February 16, when this drawdown in crypto markets really started accelerating. So again, just another example of a pocket of the market that’s generating real income, uncorrelated to” the volatility we’re seeing across crypto. The percentage of altcoins with 90-day returns greater than $BTC is reaching a historic low. This has usually been a good time to look for discounted value among altcoins, but requires tight selection and a lot of patience. pic.twitter.com/rkbFsv5D6P — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 4, 2025 If you’re looking for more tokens that buck the trend, then it’s all about figuring out what makes the token tick, Connor said. That’s how he and his team think about it. A lending protocol, for example, would be lending out to something like a crypto-native fund. The fund’s investments go up, it’s good for the protocol. A more negative environment makes that situation slightly trickier. The thing is that crypto’s not just about the vibes anymore. That’s not going to stop me from monitoring them, because I think — like retail investors in the stock market — it helps establish a sense of where we are and what people are interested in. But the reality is the market itself won’t keep reacting to vibes unless we stay focused on things like memecoins (which I’m clearly skeptical about). “We have a market that is maturing. And while it might have paid to be a vibes-based trader in the past, it helps to have different skills. Now this is a market [focused on revenues and business strategy] and less so about marketing and what people are thinking,” which means it might be time to stop doomscrolling CT.

41191760,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137196,1741183702,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Reality: Experts Doubt AI as True ‘Co-Scientist’ in Scientific Discovery,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/experts-doubt-ai-co-scientist/,"The buzz around Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undeniable, especially within the cryptocurrency and tech communities always keen on groundbreaking innovations. Recently, Google unveiled its “AI co-scientist,” promising to revolutionize scientific research. But is AI truly ready to be a partner in scientific discovery, or is it just another case of tech hype outpacing reality? Experts are raising crucial questions about the current capabilities of AI in the intricate world of scientific exploration. Let’s delve into why the scientific community remains skeptical about AI’s readiness to be a genuine ‘co-scientist’. Is the AI Co-Scientist Just Hype? Examining AI Limitations in Research Google’s ambitious announcement of an “AI co-scientist” designed to assist researchers in hypothesis creation and research planning has been met with a healthy dose of skepticism. Sarah Beery, a computer vision researcher at MIT, points out, “This preliminary tool, while interesting, doesn’t seem likely to be seriously used.” Her sentiment reflects a broader concern: is there genuine demand within the scientific community for such hypothesis-generating systems? The core issue lies in whether these tools truly address the needs and workflows of scientists or if they are primarily driven by public relations ambitions. While tech giants like OpenAI, with CEO Sam Altman’s vision of “superintelligent” AI accelerating scientific breakthroughs, and Anthropic, with CEO Dario Amodei’s bold predictions about AI curing cancer, paint a promising future, the current reality, according to many researchers, is far from these grand pronouncements. The crux of the matter is the perceived gap between the hype surrounding AI and its actual utility in guiding and enhancing the scientific process. Consider Google’s own claims about their AI co-scientist’s potential in drug repurposing for acute myeloid leukemia. Pathologist Favia Dubyk from Northwest Medical Center-Tucson notes the vagueness of these results, stating, “no legitimate scientist would take [them] seriously.” While acknowledging potential as a starting point, the critical lack of detailed information raises serious trust issues and hinders a proper evaluation of its helpfulness. This isn’t an isolated incident. Google faced similar criticism in 2020 when their AI for breast tumor detection was challenged by Harvard and Stanford researchers in Nature due to the lack of reproducible methods and code. The scientific community’s apprehension stems from a pattern of tech companies, especially Google, announcing ‘breakthroughs’ without the necessary transparency and rigor expected in scientific validation. Decoding the Complexities: Why Scientific Discovery Demands More Than Current AI Research Tools Offer The development of effective AI research tools for scientific discovery faces significant hurdles. One major challenge is the sheer complexity of scientific processes, often involving numerous and unforeseen variables. While AI can be valuable in areas requiring broad exploration, such as sifting through vast datasets to narrow down possibilities, its ability to replicate the intuitive, out-of-the-box problem-solving crucial for major scientific leaps is questionable. Professor Ashique KhudaBukhsh from Rochester Institute of Technology highlights this point: “We’ve seen throughout history that some of the most important scientific advancements, like mRNA vaccines, were driven by human intuition and perseverance in the face of skepticism. AI, as it stands today, may not be well-suited to replicate that.” Lana Sinapayen, an AI researcher at Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Japan, further refines this perspective. She believes the focus of tools like Google’s AI co-scientist is misdirected. Instead of automating hypothesis generation – a task many scientists find intellectually stimulating – AI could offer more practical help by automating tedious yet essential tasks such as: Summarizing extensive academic literature Formatting research papers to meet specific grant application requirements Managing and organizing research data For many researchers, generating hypotheses is the most engaging aspect of their work. As Sinapayen aptly puts it, “Why would I want to outsource my fun to a computer, and then be left with only the hard work to do myself?” This sentiment underscores a potential disconnect between AI developers’ understanding of scientific workflows and the actual needs and desires of scientists. Beyond Hypothesis: The Unseen Hurdles in AI-Driven Scientific Research Sarah Beery emphasizes that the most demanding phase in scientific inquiry often lies in designing and executing studies to validate or refute a hypothesis. This crucial stage is where current AI systems fall short. Consider these limitations: Physical Experimentation: AI cannot physically conduct experiments or use lab equipment. A significant portion of scientific work involves hands-on experimentation and data collection in the real world. Limited Data Scenarios: AI often struggles with problems where data is scarce. Many scientific frontiers involve exploring uncharted territories with limited prior information. Contextual Understanding: AI lacks the nuanced understanding of a researcher’s specific lab context, research goals, past work, skill set, and available resources. This context is vital for effective scientific investigation. These limitations highlight that while AI might assist in certain aspects of scientific research, it cannot replace the comprehensive, multifaceted approach that human scientists bring to the table. Navigating the AI Risk Landscape: Junk Science and Reliability Concerns in AI Research Tools Beyond technical shortcomings, the inherent risks associated with AI, such as its tendency to ‘hallucinate’ or generate inaccurate information, raise further concerns within the scientific community. Professor KhudaBukhsh warns about the potential for AI tools to flood scientific literature with ‘junk science.’ This is not a hypothetical concern; a recent study revealed a surge of AI-fabricated, low-quality research polluting platforms like Google Scholar. The implications are serious: Overburdened Peer Review: A flood of AI-generated, substandard research could overwhelm the already strained peer-review process, particularly in rapidly growing fields like computer science. Compromised Research Integrity: Even well-designed studies could be tainted by unreliable AI outputs, undermining the overall quality and trustworthiness of scientific findings. Ethical and Environmental Concerns: Sinapayen also points to ethical issues and the substantial energy consumption associated with training many AI systems, adding another layer of complexity to their widespread adoption in research. For now, while AI offers intriguing possibilities in assisting with certain scientific tasks like literature review, a cautious and critical approach is essential. The scientific community’s skepticism isn’t about rejecting technological progress; it’s about ensuring that AI tools are rigorously validated, transparently developed, and genuinely enhance, rather than hinder, the pursuit of reliable scientific knowledge.

BITW, a market-cap-weighted crypto fund, trades at a discount due to SEC restrictions but may rise if rules change to include more cryptocurrencies in ETFs. Cryptocurrencies correlate highly with market liquidity and margin debt, indicating potential bearish trends due to reduced free cash and high margin debt levels. BITW's market-cap weighting strategy is flawed, likely leading to underperformance in a mean-reverting market. Despite widespread hopes that the new administration would benefit the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has been down around 25% since Trump took office. Although Trump may not be the core cause of this crash, it is curious to me that Bitcoin peaked on that day and has been on a bearish trend since. I believe this is a tell-tale sign of a ""buy the rumor, sell the news event,"" the rumor being the cryptocurrency strategic reserve without concrete plans to accomplish this. Bitcoin temporarily rebounded on Monday after Trump announced intent to achieve this, but again, there are no concrete plans. In light of tariffs and other sensitive issues, it seems to me that the administration is prioritizing other matters. I agree with the hedge fund Elliot's take that the President may need to defend the US dollar in light of high market valuations, trade conflicts, the debt ceiling, and the BRICS nations' effort to de-dollarize. Many investors may consider cryptocurrency funds an option to speculate on the growing Bitcoin volatility. One interesting example is the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ( OTC:BITW ), which trades on the over-the-counter market. Unlike other cryptocurrency market investment options like ( IBIT ) or ( GBTC ), BITW invests in a pool of the largest ten cryptos including Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Ripple ( XRP-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Chainlink ( LINK-USD ), Avalance ( AVAX-USD ), Litecoin ( LTC-USD ), Sui ( SUI-USD ), and Polkadot ( DOT-USD ). Notably, the fund is market capitalization-weighted, so 76% of its holdings are in Bitcoin. About 12% are in Ethereum, 6% in Ripple, 3% in Solana, and around 1% or less in the rest. Since BITW is on the OTC market and does not have widespread liquidity benefits, it usually trades at a discount to its NAV. For example, on its Monday close, it traded at $51.2 with an NAV of $58.8. That means BITW investors buy this portfolio at a ~12% discount. Although attractive, investing in the OTC market comes with the associated liquidity risk. Importantly, there is a reasonable expectation that the SEC will eventually expand its rules to allow cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum to be in ETFs. Currently, Solana , Litecoin , and XRP have outstanding applications for ETF approval from the SEC, which may occur by October . This potential approval is supported by the recent creation of the SEC "" Crypto Task Force ,"" headed by Hester Peirce, who has a track record of supporting digital assets. Technically, BITW is a trust not an ETF; thus, it has a significant discount to NAV. However, BITW should rise toward its NAV if all of the cryptocurrencies in it are allowed by the SEC to be in ETFs. Though this is a positive potential catalyst for BITW, the recent crypto volatility may validate the SEC's historical opinion that cryptocurrencies are too risky. Regardless, the current environment may push BITW's value lower regardless of SEC approval, particularly given the apparent flaw of its market capitalization weighting strategy. Crypto Is A Sink For Excess Retail Liquidity I see cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as primary pools for excess market liquidity. During the past twelve years (since the GFC recovery), the US stock market and economy have benefited from liquidity stimulus efforts such as ultra-low interest rates, waves of quantitative easing, and direct Treasury stimulus programs, all of which push more cash into the financial system, arguably far more than the financial system requires. Thus, we've seen stock market valuations rise astronomically. At the same time, more retail investors speculate on assets not backed by cash flows, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs, not to mention an increase in general online gambling . If we look at the long-term price trend of Bitcoin against individual investor's portfolio cash allocation levels, we can see that Bitcoin's price trends are often inversely correlated to portfolio cash levels. This is more true since ~2017 when Bitcoin became mainstream. Typically, we see Bitcoin's bull market periods end when investor portfolio cash levels reach a trough, and Bitcoin usually rises after cash allocations are high. Bitcoin is also highly correlated to changes in FINRA margin debt or the total amount of margin debt. See below: Data by YCharts The long-term relationship is strong but does vary and is not a direct indicator. Since last year, individual investor cash allocations have been generally low, yet Bitcoin rallied significantly after Trump's election. Individual investor cash levels are also not as low as they've been and could fall further, potentially as more market liquidity flows into cryptocurrency. However, in general, I think this pattern is bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Even though very little overall margin debt goes into Bitcoin, both are highly correlated to speculative market activity and short-term trading, particularly among retail traders. Margin debt is very high today and, though it is rising, may be reaching a peak as it crosses above the 2022 peak (which aligned with the previous Bitcoin peak). Again, I think this points to a bearish market liquidity dynamics reversal for cryptocurrencies. Market Capitalization Weighting Pitfalls Many index funds use market capitalization weighting not because it is best for investors, but because it is easier to manage from a liquidity standpoint. In general, equal-weighted funds should have lower volatility because they diversify more. Equal weighting also causes funds to take profits when one asset rises disproportionally, reinvesting the gains into those with less. Usually, cryptocurrencies are ""buy low, sell high"" assets. Many have made immense profits by buying the dip and selling after large bull market rallies. This differs from many stocks with more momentum effects because outperforming companies can grow faster than their peers, improving their fundamental value with a higher stock price. Older large-scale studies find momentum is not apparent in the cryptocurrency market, usually in stocks. However, unlike most stocks, studies over the same period saw statistical signs of mean-reversion in cryptocurrencies . That means cryptocurrencies often underperform after outperforming, and vice versa. Thus, I see BITW's strategy as flawed because it tends to invest more money in winning cryptocurrencies at the expense of underperformers. Further, should a top cryptocurrency like Bitcoin lose value, it will have to sell a more significant portion at a loss, shifting money into outperformers. That said, BITW has fallen by ~19% YTD, while Bitcoin is down ~13%. Though those figures are changing rapidly by the hour, we see more volatility in the non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies. BITW's exposure to more non-Bitcoin cryptos is giving it added negative pressure for now. Still, I expect that its market-capitalization weighting will cause it to underperform in the long run and limit the value of its diversification. The Bottom Line The two key questions for BITW investors are the SEC's potential rule change to allow more cryptocurrencies in ETFs, which should close its NAV discount, and Trump's possible plans to make a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. In my view, it is unclear if that is a concrete plan or not and to what extent the upside from it is already reflected by the rise in cryptocurrencies since November. At this point, if Trump fails to make such a reserve, I expect BITW will face a moderate downside. I am also bearish on cryptocurrencies because there is less free cash floating around the financial markets than a year or two ago. The downside we've seen in risk assets over the past six weeks is potentially indicative of a more significant correction. Of course, that is not guaranteed, as markets often rebound after such declines. Regardless, I am bearish on BITW, primarily because its market-cap weighting strategy is inefficient in a mean-reverting market.",BTC-USD|ETH-USD|XRP-USD|SOL-USD|ADA-USD|LINK-USD|AVAX-USD|LTC-USD|SUI-USD|DOT-USD|BITW,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-05 15:06:06

41193997,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=687270,1741187719,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41193997.jpeg,"The crypto community is turning on President Trump, and that’s a good thing",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-community-turns-on-president-trump/,"Self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump made big promises to the crypto community. He built a strong alliance with crypto investors, taking millions in campaign donations and vowing to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet.” Trump talked about cutting down on regulations, prioritizing Bitcoin, and even signed an executive order for a national stockpile/reserve, or at least that’s what he’s deluded himself into calling it. Before that, he pardoned Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht (a hero in the community) and the SEC dropped its case against Coinbase, TRON, Gemini, and Kraken. Everything looked great. Then he took it too far. Over the weekend, Trump announced a US strategic crypto reserve, not just for Bitcoin but also for Ether, XRP, Solana’s SOL, and Cardano’s ADA. That’s when everything changed. Screenshot of President Donald Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. Source: Donald Trump ((x/Twitter) His crypto supporters, the same people who backed him for cutting red tape, suddenly saw a massive problem. Buying Bitcoin with government money is one thing. Buying a mix of unproven shitcoins? Oh no, the community turned on him so fast. But there’s also something else at play here. The blatant market manipulation and insider trading that’s going on is truly heartbreaking. A whale opened up some long positions on Bitcoin and Ether literally 4 hours before Trump made the announcement when the market was wobbly. After the announcement, the whale closed their position and cashed out on tens of millions of dollars. The very next day, another whale opened up short positions merely hours before Trump made the announcement to go ahead with tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The consensus in the community is that the Trump family is just playing us all, especially since Eric Trump keeps posting and telling people to “HOLD (long-term).” Trump did rugpull crypto investors with his MELANIA and TRUMP meme coins in January, and as Cryptopolitan reported , crypto scammer Hayden Davis himself admitted that Trump was in on the dubious operation. Hayden was involved in deploying both meme coins. It’s pretty clear that Trump doesn’t actually take this industry seriously at all. Once again, the real estate showman has hoodwinked us all, just as Arthur Hayes predicted months ago. Crypto investors call out Trump’s risky plan Anyway, after Trump name-dropped those so-called altcoins in his ridiculous announcement, crypto elites were fast to react. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase and a part of Trump’s crypto inner circle, said on X: “Excited to learn more. Still forming an opinion on asset allocation, but my current thinking is: 1. Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest, and clear story as successor to gold 2. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto assets to keep it unbiased. But probably the first option is easiest.” Joe Lonsdale, founder of 8VC and a proud Trump supporter, also lashed out at the administration, saying, “Taxation is theft. It’s wrong to steal my money for grift on the left; it’s also wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes.” Many Americans will probably agree with Joe. I mean, they want less taxes, and less government spending, not more. Using taxpayer funds to buy something as volatile as Solana is an economic scam no matter how you look at it. David Sacks, the venture capitalist tapped as White House AI and crypto czar tried to calm things down. “Nobody announced a tax or a spending program,” he told Joe on X. “Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed.” But that didn’t stop the backlash. Naval Ravikant, an early crypto investor, called the plan “exit liquidity for cryptocurrencies that are decentralized in name only.” Vinny Lingham, another longtime investor, wrote: “I don’t think the government should be pumping our crypto bags with taxpayer money while we are running a near $2 trillion deficit.” Tyler Winklevoss, billionaire Bitcoin investor and long-term Trump supporter, is also speaking out. “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA, but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve,” he said. “Only one digital asset meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.” Trump triggers a market crash — again Over the weekend, there was an initial rally after Trump’s announcement. But by Monday afternoon, Bitcoin had fallen 9%, Ether was down 15%, and XRP and SOL tumbled by 11% and 16% respectively. Traders saw the backlash and realized that Trump’s plan wasn’t as solid as it seemed. But I mean, when has a Trump plan ever been solid? The guy runs on pure vibes and little foresight. As proof of that, take a look at the unnecessary fight he has picked with Canada, America’s friendliest, most reliable ally. But there were still a few voices in the crypto community defending Trump. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy, stood by him. His company holds $43 billion in Bitcoin, making it the biggest institutional investor in the history of the market. “There’s no way to interpret this other than bullish for Bitcoin and the entire US crypto industry,” he told CNBC, which frankly disappointed the author of this article a little bit, seeing as Saylor is a self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalist, and Trump’s first post didn’t even mention Bitcoin. Someone likely had to remind him, and then he made a second announcement, going, “Oh but of course, Bitcoin too.” The OG post only mentioned the shitcoins. How bizarre is that? He never mentioned ADA and XRP on the campaign trail when he wanted to win over the industry. He only spoke about Bitcoin. But when the CEO of Ripple (Brad Garlinghouse) and the creator of Cardano (Charlie Hoskinson) allegedly hung out with him in Mar-a-Lago more than once, suddenly, Trump’s pro-XRP, he’s pro-ADA. I doubt he even knows the first thing about either network. But Bitcoin doesn’t have a face attached to it, it doesn’t have lobbyists, and chances are, Satoshi Nakamoto isn’t even American, so why should Trump care? Had Satoshi gone to see him and dropped a cool $5 million into the jar, the president would’ve remembered to mention Bitcoin for sure. This guy is a businessman. There’s over a dozen videos of him online basically telling the world he loves making money more than anything. If there’s no money in it for Trump, he’s not gonna give anything the time of day. That’s just the kind of person he is, and we’re not judging him for who he is. Just stating an obvious trait. Now, Anthony Pompliano, a well-known crypto investor, spent over 1,500 words in his newsletter breaking down why the move was a mistake. He argued that Trump was influenced by the wrong people. “We watched crypto projects, lobbyists, and special interest groups co-opt the President of the United States,” Anthony wrote. He said they convinced Trump to support US-made tokens, which fit perfectly with his America First agenda. “The world is not going to be run on XRP or ADA. People don’t use those assets right now in the same way they use Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin. Again, there is nothing strategic about this,” said Anthony. Anthony also believes that: “Trump is potentially negotiating in public with this announcement. If he wanted to get a bitcoin strategic reserve done, then The Art of the Deal would suggest Trump should ask for much more at the outset. As the idea of the reserve works through the political process, Trump is well positioned to give up the idea of adding altcoins to the reserve and can fall back on only adding bitcoin.” Bitcoin supporters fear government control The deeper issue though is that many in crypto (including this author) don’t trust any government to handle Bitcoin or any digital asset. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, says it best: “We don’t need Bitcoin or any other crypto asset to trade at any specific price.” Nic added that the US government doesn’t need to hold crypto reserves because it has no liabilities tied to them. “I don’t see why we would disrupt ourselves. It throws global markets into upheaval again.” There’s also the question of what this will even do to or for the US economy. Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a Bitcoin reserve bill last year, arguing that the US could cut its debt in half in 20 years just by holding Bitcoin. Cynthia’s logic is that Bitcoin’s price keeps going up, so the government could eventually sell it for a massive profit. But I’m personally not convinced. Do we really have to point out that just because Bitcoin has gone up in the past doesn’t mean it always will? Come on now. Stephen Cecchetti, an economist, compared the whole strategic reserve idea to gambling on credit cards to pay off a mortgage. “Using US debt to buy a large amount of crypto could increase the likelihood that credit rating agencies would downgrade the US, increasing the cost of borrowing,” Stephen said. Even if the Bitcoin reserve worked, there’s another problem: What happens when the US government decides to sell? A massive sell-off could crash Bitcoin’s price, wiping out gains for everyone else. That’s why many crypto believers, like me, don’t want the government involved in the first place. I mean, this goes against everything Satoshi envisioned in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Whoever he is, wherever he is, dead or alive, chances are he is disappointed and horrified at what we’ve managed to turn his perfect creation into. I’m honestly embarrassed for us all.",OP-ED|ADA|BTC|ETH|SOL|USD|XRP,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS|ADA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-05 15:15:19

Investors expected a rally, but instead, prices have tumbled. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) is unfazed, charging ahead on its mission to the moon. With momentum building behind this Web3 gaming disruptor, some analysts predict it could rally up to 50x this year. With its presale offering deep discounts, it’s no wonder investors are flocking to the project ahead of major exchange listings. Rollblock (RBLK): Web3 Gaming Disruptor Changing the Industry The $500 billion gaming industry has long lacked any kind of transparency, but Rollblock ( RBLK ) is here to rewrite the rules. With all bids and payouts secured on the Ethereum blockchain, every transaction is verifiable at any time, solving one of the biggest issues in online gaming. This innovation is fueling rapid growth, with new signups, deposits, and wagered bids hitting record highs every month. Investors have poured $10.8 million into Rollblock’s presale, snapping up discounted tokens before the price rises once more. The platform offers 7,000 classic games like poker and blackjack, as well as many exclusives such as Cash Compass and an exciting sports prediction league. And with fiat deposits now enabled via Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, on-ramping has never been easier. What Makes RBLK Such a Winning Investment? Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model sets it apart from the crowd. The platform reinvests 30% of its revenue into buying RBLK from the open market. Of these buybacks, 60% are burned immediately to reduce the supply, while 40% funds staking rewards of up to 30% APY for loyal holders. These tokens will likely never be sold. Stage 10 tokens are selling fast, with over 40% already gone at just $0.06. With major exchange listings on the horizon, prices are expected to rise soon. Investors can also refer a friend in March to receive a 30% RBLK bonus, plus a 20% bonus on all purchases this month. Check out this video from Freddie Finance for the lowdown: https://youtu.be/qztj3p8uy_c?si=wfJOpyY8-u8d_chz Solana (SOL): Sell-Off Creates Buying Opportunity Solana has risen by 9.25% to $149 today. Trump’s announcement that it will feature in his crypto reserve has led to Solana jumping above the dollar mark, Solana hasn’t been immune to the broader market downturn. Traders will be looking for longs in the DEMAND ZONE between $150 and $160. If Solana makes it to this level, there is good risk/reward in taking a long position as the upside could be significant. Solana’s unmatched speed and efficiency mean that it has dominated this cycle and Solana could hit $500 in 2025 as bullish momentum returns. XRP (XRP): Will It Smash Through the $3 Resistance Level? XRP is up by 5.13% in the last 24 hours to reach $2.51 .This comes amid XRP being named as one of the ‘All-American’ tokens in Donald Trump’s upcoming strategic crypto reserve. The market-wide sell-off has dragged XRP lower but is now showing signs of recovery, its long-term potential looks strong. WiseCharts recently posted that XRP is bouncing strongly from the support level just below $2. If this holds, then many traders will be looking for higher targets for XRP around the $3 level. With major financial institutions expanding their use of XRP for cross-border payments, many see this as a temporary setback. XRP could have an incredible year and a possible surge toward its all-time high this quarter. RBLK Shining Despite Market Sell-Off Market sell-offs can create buying opportunities, but Rollblock (RBLK) remains the standout pick. Its presale discount won’t last forever, and prices are set to climb. Investors looking for the biggest gains in 2025 should look into Rollblock, the Web3 gaming revolution that’s only just getting started.

41193831,https://finbold.com/?p=239993,1741187910,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,4 billion XRP tokens released by Ripple in a year,https://finbold.com/4-billion-xrp-tokens-released-by-ripple-in-a-year/,"Ripple Labs, the issuer and biggest holder of XRP , has been maintaining a system of gradual releases for additional tokens into circulation for years. This approach, further developed with an escrow system in 2017, has ensured the digital asset has remained slightly inflationary through its existence. Specifically, on the first day of each month, the company unlocks 1 billion XRP, making 20-30% (200-300 million tokens) available for trading to raise additional funds for its operations while re-locking the rest. In March 2025, the proportion may be changing somewhat, as Finbold reported that Ripple might be preparing to sell as much as $795 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Simultaneously, the circulating supply of XRP has been increasing at a heightened pace. There were 56.5 billion tokens in circulation at the start of 2023 and 58.6 billion at the start of 2024, per the data Finbold retrieved using the Wayback Machine , indicating a 2 billion annual increase. At press time on March 5, 2025, the number increased to 62.8 billion, hinting at an unlock acceleration to 4 billion per year, according to the information retrieved from XRPscan . XRP distribution on March 5, 2025. Source: XRPscan. In total, the number of XRP in circulation rose from the 20 billion initially available in 2012 by nearly 43 billion, and 37 billion remain escrowed, demonstrating that the current system is likely to remain stable for years. Is XRP inflation the token’s main price driver? Monthly unlocks of 200–300 million XRP (~$500–700M at $2.46) could increase selling pressure , but they’ve not been major price drivers. Instead, the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, ongoing since 2020, has been the primary suppressant. In general, the cryptocurrency has become fairly susceptible to external factors as evidenced both by the rally in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s re-election – and the expected shift in the U.S. policy towards the industry – and the subsequent struggles. Despite the hopes for the current administration, the relative lack of progress in terms of creating a strategic cryptocurrency reserve has ensured that XRP failed to sustain its upward momentum and recent highs and is 15.48% year-to-date (YTD) at its press time price of $2.46.

While it remains unclear whether this rise is short-lived or the beginning of a new upward wave, the experienced analyst said that BTC is no longer likely to fall below $69,000. Timothy Peterson has announced a new floor level for the Bitcoin price based on his “Low Price Forward” metric. According to this metric, the analyst stated that it is difficult for the Bitcoin price to fall below $ 69,000, and that BTC has a 95% chance of staying above $ 69,000. “The Lowest Price Forward doesn't tell you where Bitcoin will be. It tells you where Bitcoin won't be. There is a 95% chance it will fall below $69,000.” Peterson added that BTC’s decline to $78,000 is unsustainable and that such deep declines usually lead to a two to three month consolidation period before the uptrend resumes, after which the bullish period will begin. “A major decline in Bitcoin is always followed by a cooling period of 2-3 months. After that, the game starts again as if nothing happened.” *This is not investment advice.

Crypto markets soared following the news, but by Monday had given back all these gains. Bitwise noted that investors became disgruntled with the announcement because the planned reserve will hold tokens other than just bitcoin (BTC). The President announced that XRP, solana (SOL) and cardano (ADA) would be included in a strategic reserve, and later added bitcoin and ether (ETH) to the list of assets. ""The inclusion of speculative assets like cardano feels more calculating that strategic,"" wrote Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, adding that despite the ""flawed rollout"" the market has got it wrong. ""Trump's initial proposal is rarely his final,"" the report noted, and the final reserve will likely be comprised of almost entirely bitcoin. It will also be larger than the market is expecting. If the U.S. does establish a strategic crypto reserve, other nation states will likely follow suit, Bitwise said, and any digital assets that are acquired will likely be held for a significant amount of time. ""The U.S. government declaring crypto assets 'strategic' is bullish,"" and the market will eventually come round to this way of thinking, the report added.

Bitcoin closed February at the most negative returns, down 17.39%, for the first time since 2014. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and the made in USA category of altcoins XRP , Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ) are part of the strategic reserve. Market participants were optimistic in their response to the announcement before turning fearful and ushering over $1.07 billion in liquidations on Monday. As traders reel from the aftermath of the series of events, traders look forward to the White House Crypto Summit planned for March 7, Friday. Table of Contents Top 5 Made in USA altcoins to buy XRP, Solana, Cardano buy zones, analysis and price targets Solana price target Cardano price target What to expect from White House crypto summit Derivatives analysis and institutional interest in Bitcoin, Ethereum Expert commentary Top 5 Made in USA altcoins to buy XRP, Solana, Cardano, Chainlink ( LINK ), and Stellar ( XLM ) are the top five picks in the made in USA category based on their price trend and on-chain analysis. The emphasis on “made in USA” stems from the emerging regulatory clarity for meme coins, AI tokens and cryptocurrencies in the U.S., top talent, robust infrastructure and support for blockchain innovation under the new administration. In mid-February 2025, Nansen analysts reported on the rise of “made in USA” narrative and top tokens in the category, reinforcing U.S. dominance in the crypto ecosystem. Made in USA altcoins | Source: CoinGecko Among other tokens, Pi Network ( PI ) rose to top 20 tokens by market capitalization in the past few weeks, with notable developments in the project. Hedera ( HBAR ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Sui ( SUI ) are the other key tokens in the category. As Bitcoin backpedaled and wiped out nearly all gains since mid-November, traders remained fearful, as seen on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. The metric reads 20 on a scale of 0 to 100, and the reading implies that traders are “fearful.” Crypto Fear and Greed Index | Source: Alternative XRP, Solana, Cardano buy zones, analysis and price targets XRP price target The XRP/USDT daily price chart on Crypto.news shows the buy zone for the altcoin is between the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), between $2.3020 and $2.5203. The token could test resistance at $3.0030, the upper boundary of an imbalance zone on the daily price chart. The technical indicators RSI and MACD support a bullish thesis for XRP. RSI is sloping upwards and reads 49, close to neutral. MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. The target for XRP price is the $3.40 peak, and the immediate resistance is at the $3.0030 level.

The Ethereum competitor token is close to its long-term support at $150, and a daily candlestick close above this level could signal a likelihood of a rally to resistance at $180. SOL’s three EMAs, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs at $182.85, $191.30, and $184.91, are key resistances for the token in its uptrend.

Whether it is tariff announcements, executive orders or plans for a summit/ event, it has moved markets and volatility in the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum has jumped on the 30-day timeframe. A key market mover, the White House Crypto Summit on March 7 is coming up and traders are positioning themselves for anticipated price swings. The President and his AI & Crypto Czar, David Sacks, announced plans well in advance and picked industry leaders, executives, and policymakers to participate in the summit. The purpose is to meet with the members of President Trump’s working group on digital assets at the White House. Policy issues, crypto regulation, support for blockchain innovation, sandboxes and regulatory framework for digital assets. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Bitcoin proponent and Strategy executive chair Michael Saylor, and Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov are among the top executives invited to the White House. Executives from top crypto exchanges are also expected to attend the event, contributing to a meaningful dialogue with the administration. Derivatives analysis and institutional interest in Bitcoin, Ethereum Analysis of derivatives market data shows that the top five cryptocurrencies have observed a significant spike in Open Interest (OI), the total number of open derivatives positions in the asset. Liquidation in the market is now capped at close to $218 million for Bitcoin and $105 million for Ethereum in the last 24 hours. While volume has declined in double-digits, OI and price have a positive correlation, according to Coinglass data. Derivatives analysis for top 5 cryptocurrencies | Source: Coinglass Bitcoin analysis shows the long/short ratio, a key metric to determine whether traders are bullish/ bearish on the token exceeds 1 on Wednesday. Bitcoin traders are betting on further gain in the token’s price this week. Bitcoin derivatives data analysis | Source: Coinglass Ethereum notes similar activity, OI has climbed nearly 3%, Options OI climbed nearly 6%. Long/short ratio exceeds 1, meaning ETH derivatives traders are bullish on the altcoin and expect gains in the short term. Ethereum derivatives data analysis | Source: Coinglass Institutional interest in Bitcoin has waned while Ethereum recorded its first positive day of netflows on Tuesday. Bitcoin has a streak where 10 out of 11 business days, there is a net outflow from U.S. based Spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the case of Ethereum, ETFs recorded over $14 million in net flows, meaning the altcoin is seeing a revival in interest among institutional investors, according to Farside Investors data . Expert commentary Agne Linge, Head of Growth at WeFi told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “The market is facing intense volatility as combined crypto liquidations hit $1.04 billion. Bitcoin has dropped to a low of $82,467.23 before recovering slightly above $83,000. Ethereum dropped below $2,100 for the first time in 15 months as the price fell 12.7% in 24 hours. The broader altcoin train has a double-digit decline, highlighting the uncertainty in the market at this time. Amid this price action, the conviction for sustainable growth in the near term remains low as significant headwinds lie ahead.” In its market note shared with Crypto.news David Morrison, Senior Market Analyst at Trade Nation said: “Crypto currencies continue to swing around violently. Bitcoin briefly poked its nose back above $90,000 having dropped below $80,000 on Friday, taking it back to levels last seen soon after Trump’s election victory in early November. Ether was also firmer this morning having dipped below $2,000 briefly yesterday, effectively halving in price over the last ten weeks.

The news triggered a wave of buying activity, sending Cardano soaring as investors reacted to the unexpected endorsement.

However, the excitement was short-lived as ADA dropped over 35% in the following days, dragged down by a broader market meltdown. The sharp correction left traders questioning whether Cardano could sustain its momentum or if it would struggle alongside the rest of the crypto market. Despite the recent pullback, analysts and investors remain bullish, believing ADA is well-positioned for future gains once market conditions improve. Many expect Cardano to outperform in the next rally, especially given the strong accumulation trends seen among major players. On-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales accumulated over 420 million ADA following Trump’s announcement, indicating confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. This surge in whale activity suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors are positioning themselves ahead of the next market move. Cardano Prepares For A Historic Rally Cardano is currently trading below crucial liquidity around $1 after days of massive volatility, struggling to maintain stability as selling pressure intensifies. Bulls are attempting to reclaim control, but the overall market remains uncertain, with extreme selling pressure keeping ADA from making a decisive move. Despite the recent decline, analysts are still calling for a breakout, though sentiment remains divided. The broader crypto market is in a state of uncertainty, with investors cautious about the next major move. Until Cardano can establish strong support and break through key resistance, traders remain on edge. However, on-chain data suggests growing optimism among major investors. Ali Martinez shared Santiment data on X, revealing that following President Trump’s announcement of the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, whales accumulated over 420 million ADA. This signals confidence among high-net-worth investors who see long-term value in Cardano despite short-term volatility. Notably, this whale accumulation trend has been ongoing since late 2024, with large holders buying ADA whenever prices drop. This suggests that whales are strategically positioning themselves for future price action, expecting Cardano to perform well in the next market cycle.

If bulls can reclaim key levels, ADA could see a strong recovery. However, failure to hold current support may lead to further downside pressure, aligning with the broader market’s struggles. Investors are now watching closely to see whether Cardano can withstand the turbulence and set up for its next major move. Price Testing Crucial Resistance Level Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.95 after a period of massive price swings, surging from $0.65 to $1.17, only to drop back to $0.75 before rebounding to current levels. This extreme volatility has kept traders on edge as ADA struggles to establish a clear trend. For bulls to regain control, reclaiming the $1 mark with conviction is crucial. A decisive breakout above this psychological level could signal a major rally, potentially pushing ADA beyond multi-year highs around $1.30. Such a move would reinforce bullish momentum and set the stage for further price expansion in the coming weeks. However, holding above $0.75 remains essential to prevent further downside pressure. This level has acted as a key demand zone, supporting ADA through multiple retracements. A breakdown below $0.75 could trigger renewed selling pressure, extending losses and delaying any potential recovery.

33767162,[object Object],1741188608,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,$2.6 Million in Unreported Income—Ex-Partner of Crypto Kingpin Faces Prison,https://bitcoinist.com/2-6-million-in-unreported-income-partner-of-crypto/,"A former girlfriend of a cryptocurrency fraudster, known in the industry as “The Godfather,” has admitted to a federal tax charge stemming from her involvement in his illicit activities. Iris Ramaya Au, 35, is accused of failing to report more than $2.6 million in earnings obtained through her former partner’s criminal schemes. According to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Au’s agreement to plead guilty to a felony tax charge marks another chapter in the government’s pursuit of those benefiting from illegal cryptocurrency dealings . Crypto Fraud Unraveled: Role in Financial Operations and Lifestyle Authorities claim that between 2020 and 2024, Au’s former boyfriend—known only as “Iza”—orchestrated a series of fraudulent schemes, including unauthorized access to advertising accounts and credit lines from major social media companies. These actions reportedly generated millions in unreported income for Iza, which Au then helped manage and spend. Au’s involvement extended beyond being a passive recipient of funds. She allegedly set up shell corporations and opened bank accounts to handle the incoming money. The government asserts that these accounts were used to pay off law enforcement officers for private security services, fund luxurious lifestyles, and acquire high-value assets such as real estate, luxury vehicles, and cryptocurrency. Over time, Au transferred more than $2.6 million from these accounts into her own personal accounts. Prosecutors also note that the funds supported recreational activities valued at nearly $10 million and helped acquire approximately $16 million in cryptocurrency. Yet, despite receiving these substantial amounts , Au did not report the income on her federal tax returns. The IRS claims that this omission was intentional, resulting in the federal tax charge to which she has now agreed to plead guilty. Iza’s Legal Challenges and Ongoing Investigations Au’s plea agreement follows the earlier guilty plea of Iza, who is facing multiple charges including conspiracy against rights, wire fraud, and tax evasion. Iza’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for later this year, where he could face up to 35 years in prison. In contrast, Au’s plea deal could lead to a sentence of up to three years in federal prison . The DoJ noted: After pleading guilty, Au will face up to three years in federal prison. On January 30, Iza appeared before a federal judge and pleaded guilty to a first superseding information charging him with conspiracy against rights, wire fraud, and tax evasion. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 16, at which time he will face up to 35 years in federal prison. Iza has been in federal custody since September 2024. Meanwhile, the agency further revealed that Investigations into the broader scheme remain ongoing, with the IRS and FBI actively involved. The Justice Department also stated that it will continue to pursue those who fail to report income from illegal sources, regardless of how the funds are obtained or spent.

This surge in the Pepecoin crypto price correlates with the increase seen in the broader crypto market. Yet, amid all of this increased activity, another contender, Panshibi (SHIBI) , nears the end of its presale, beckoning on investors to join before it is too late. This moment, charged with potential, unveils a tale of two coins one rising on momentum, the other poised for a breakout. Let us do a deep dive below. U.S. Crypto Reserve Plan Sparks Optimism for PepeCoin The price of PepeCoin remains unstable because of massive selling activity from whales. The Pepe-the-Frog-inspired coin has seen major price swings since its inception in 2023. PepeCoin reached its highest value at $0.000028 after a staggering 150,000% climb but has since experienced a major correction. On March 2, following the announcement of Trump’s plans for a strategic U.S reserve, Pepecoin crypto price briefly surged 20% to $0.000009 but after a wave of sell offs the price currently trades at $0.000007 reflecting a 19% decrease in the past 24 hours. PEPE still displays positive indicators due to recent promising developments in the United States crypto scene. The renewed optimism PEPE saw when U.S. President Donald Trump suggested building a strategic cryptocurrency reserve represents bullish conditions for both recovery and future price growth. While Pepecoin crypto enjoyed its brief rally, Panshibi (SHIBI) stands at a critical juncture. Its presale priced at $0.005 per token , nears its close with less than 21 days remaining. Having raised over $1.22 million, this panda-inspired contender blends Asian flair with meme coin appeal, offering staking rewards up to 1,200% APY. Investors eyeing early entry see a projected 500% jump to $0.026 upon listing, a tantalizing prospect. Why Panshibi Could Outshine Pepe Coin Crypto Performance In 2025 The urgency is palpable: Panshibi’s presale has its sights set at raising $10 million, and as a result stage 4 tokens are dwindling fast. With a total supply of 2 billion tokens, 60% has been allocated to the token presale putting control in the hands of the community. Panshibi ensures liquidity locks and audited smart contracts , fostering trust where meme coins often falter. Its presale success hints at a community ready to propel it past speculative peers. Contrast this with Pepecoin, where price swings unsettle newcomers despite its $2.88 billion market cap. Panshibi’s structured growth, tied to real-world impact and high-yield staking, positions it as a calculated bet against Pepecoin crypto’s unpredictable hops. The numbers speak clearly: Panshibi’s presale has already crossed $1.22 million, with analysts tipping a 20x to 50x rally post-launch, dwarfing PEPE’s current trajectory. Time, however, is the crucible. Panshibi’s presale clock ticks relentlessly less than a month remains to secure a stake before SHIBI hits exchanges at a higher price. PEPE’s rally might dazzle, but its ecosystem, while vibrant, lacks the structured ambition Panshibi brings to the table. Investors face a choice: ride the frog’s wave or plant seeds with the panda. The Clock Is Counting Down To The End Of Panshibi Presale Pepecoin (PEPE) thrives in the now, its price buoyed by headlines and a meme community, but will it live up to the hype any longer? Panshibi, by contrast, is today’s meme built for tomorrow. Its presale serves as a launchpad to a future where utility and community converge. As the final days of Panshibi’s presale approach, leading ICO experts are urging investors and traders to take action now or risk losing their chance at a potential 50x return.

41194163,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=707148,1741188618,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Ethereum 2025 Price Prediction as Trump Announces US Crypto Reserve,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-2025-price-prediction-as-trump-announces-us-crypto-reserve/,"Following its inclusion in Donald Trump’s newly announced US Crypto Reserve, Ethereum’s price prediction for 2025 has become one of the hottest topics of debate among crypto enthusiasts and pundits. While a vast majority is expecting $ETH to ride the positive momentum and finally break out of its long-drawn sideways channel, some say there’s more price correction in store. In this guide, we’ll let Ethereum speak to us; we’ll analyze its technicals and fundamentals to draw out a clear picture of where we think the second-biggest crypto in the world could be headed in the coming 10 months. Ethereum 2025 Price Prediction at a Glance If you’re after a quick answer, here’s everything you need to know about $ETH’s upcoming performance: Ethereum is holding a major support zone on the weekly chart – BULLISH It’s continually respecting the important $2K level and 200 EMA – BULLISH The current support zones contain major accumulation areas – BULLISH Lower highs and lower lows are being made on the daily chart – BEARISH Moving averages sloping downwards on the lower timeframes – BEARISH Inclusion is Trump’s US Crypto Reserve – BULLISH Upcoming Pectra Upgrade – BULLISH Overall, since the higher timeframes override the smaller ones, and because the market sentiment also screams bullishness, $ETH’s larger picture looks very positive. Once it breaks and holds above a lower high, many feel we can expect $ETH to reach new highs, including the $6K mark, in 2025. Diving Deeper Into Ethereum’s Chart The best way to go about technical analysis is to start from the higher timeframes and then scoot lower. This helps establish a strong understanding of the overall direction of the cryptocurrency — whether certain short-term trends are aligned with the larger picture or just temporary price corrections. With that in mind, we’ll start our analysis at $ETH’s weekly chart. The Larger Picture Is Extremely Bullish Right off the bat, we notice that the crypto is at a major support zone (between $1.9K and $2.3K). This is where $ETH took support in November last year before bouncing to $4K. Additionally, this support zone also contains the $2K mark, which is an important psychological number. For those unaware, round figures such as this often act as strong support and resistance levels. The $2K level, in particular, is a very notable one, seeing as $ETH has reacted to it almost every single time ever since it first touched it all the way back in February 2021. Another massive positive sign is that $ETH (on the weekly chart) is currently at and reacting to the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is one of the most prominent indicators of technical analysis. Given that $BTC (on the daily chart) bounced off the 200 EMA less than a week ago, we can expect $ETH to do the same. According to Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm, the $1.9K price point is also a major accumulation zone, with over 1.82M $ETH being bought at it by long-term investors since August 2023. Having mentioned the various reasons $ETH looks ripe for an upward rally, the biggest clue we get about its upcoming prices is through the good old rectangle pattern. Simply put, Ethereum has been trapped between the $2K and $4K levels. Plus, given that this has been the case for almost a year now, a breakout above the ceiling ($4K) could see $ETH reach a new high that’s as far away as the breadth of the rectangle. The upper and lower limits of the rectangle, in this case, are $2K apart, meaning we can expect $ETH to cross $6K once it breaks above $4K. Lower Timeframes Suggest a Battle Against the Bears Although the weekly timeframe is the boss and dictates the larger picture, the daily and 4-hour timeframes often provide an excellent outlook for the short term. Unfortunately, though, the two major moving averages (50 EMA and 200 EMA) are both sloping downwards on these timeframes. This suggests that institutional buying is yet to enter the market. However, trends in crypto could change in hours because large buying often results in towering candlesticks, and just a couple of those would be enough to throw $ETH over the EMAs. Ethereum’s Market Sentiment $ETH is up 5.75% today and is currently trading at around $2,200 . The latest surge in its price is likely due to its inclusion in Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve. It is, after all, one of the only five cryptos that made it to the list. Speaking of Trump’s relationship with Ethereum, it’s worth mentioning that his crypto company, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), is HODLing over $200M worth of Ethereum. Not only is the amount huge, but $ETH also makes up nearly 65% of the firm’s entire $300M+ crypto portfolio. Clearly, Trump is backing Ethereum to hit it out of the park, which is one of the biggest reasons the $6K target looks extremely realistic. Also, Ethereum is the only other crypto besides Bitcoin to have spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), which is a huge positive as far as investor participation in $ETH is concerned. The fact that BlackRock ‘likes’ Ethereum is nothing to sniff at, either. The asset management company launched a tokenized money market fund last year, and it chose Ethereum as its blockchain of choice for this fund. Pectra Upgrade In other news, Ethereum is also nearing a huge Pectra upgrade . It was successfully deployed on the Sepolia testnet today, and Pectra’s mainnet is expected to launch in April. This update will consist of 11 major features, which will together make the Ethereum ecosystem more user-friendly, affordable, and efficient. For instance, the validator staking limit will be increased from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. In addition to being a game-changer for validators, who will be able to compound their earnings, this move is expected to reduce selling pressure over a long enough time period. What’s more, we’ll see a bunch of wallet and security improvements, too. These include batched transactions, gas sponsorship, application-wise spending limits, and different recovery mechanisms. Ethereum’s a Good Investment, but $MEMEX Could Be a Better One With Ethereum expected to nearly triple in price this year, it’s certainly shaping up to be a great investment choice for traditional crypto traders. However, for those with an appetite for higher risks and rewards, the Meme Index ($MEMEX) presale could be a better pick. $MEMEX will provide investors with the first meme indexes in the world. Thanks to its ability to revolutionize memecoin investing by offering different baskets of meme coins that are all meant for different kinds of investor psyche, $MEMEX is undoubtedly among the best meme coins on sale right now. The $MEMEX presale is fast approaching the $4M mark, and each token is currently available for just $0.0166883 — here’s how to buy $MEMEX if you’re looking to get in as an early investor. What’s more, you’ll also be able to benefit from the project’s 579% staking rewards. Last but not least, we’d like to mention that although our analysis and experience tell us that both $ETH and $MEMEX are excellent crypto investment opportunities , this article shouldn’t be considered a substitute for professional financial advice.

Burniske tells his 325,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the current downtrend is a mid-bull market pullback. He also thinks the cycle top hasn’t arrived yet. “BTC giving up a bit more ground isn’t going to change that view. Selling here is unlikely to be a good idea if you’re wavering – because if you’re selling here, it also tells me you’re prone to get sidelined on the way up. At worst, just sit on your hands, don’t even look at prices if it helps and you’re not going to do anything anyway. If you have any dry powder left, add bits here and there if things look really attractive to you, or when you feel sickest. [Not financial advice], just sharing my two sats. It looks to me like alts led BTC, BTC led equities. Equities might have some more shaking out to do, but remember this: BTC and crypto assets are the fastest horses in finance, to the downside and upside. If equities go soft enough, measures will be taken to avoid any major or systemic weakness, because Trump’s favorite scoreboard is the stock market – and crypto assets will feel those measures most acutely.” BTC is trading at $87,694 at time of writing.

The move erased the market’s post-US election gains in November 2024 and sent major indices on Wall Street into a downward tailspin, with global markets in Asia and Europe following suit. Wall Street opened markets in the red yesterday as investors weighed the consequences of escalating trade tensions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 800 points in early Asian trading hours, made a brief recovery, but ended the day down 1.55%, at 42,521. The S&P 500 shed 1.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.35% after dipping into correction territory. According to Yahoo Business, Wednesday pre-market trading shows US stock market indices have seen meager gains, with only the Russell 2000 index getting close to a 1% uptick since the markets closed on March 4. S&P 500 Index chart. Source: Yahoo News. In Europe, the STOXX 600 is up 1.28%, regaining some of yesterday’s losses, while Germany’s DAX also went up by 3.27%. Asia’s Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.8%, but Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shot up by 2.84%. “The fact that we’ve had a pretty big and speedy bounce is yet another sign that, for many active traders, the mindset is ‘buy dips,’” chief strategist at Interactive Brokers Steve Sosnick noted . Trade war escalates after retaliations The stock market’s plummet came against the backdrop of a series of retaliatory moves from US trading partners affected by Trump’s tariffs. In response to US tariffs that went into action this week, Minister of Finance Dominic LeBlanc announced that Canada has imposed 25% duties on billions of dollars in American imports. “Canada is being needlessly and unfairly targeted by these tariffs – and the U.S.’s decision leaves us with no choice but to respond to protect Canadian interests, workers and businesses. Working with provincial, territorial and industry partners, our singular focus is to get these tariffs removed as quickly as possible,” LeBlanc said in his statement . Mexico and China also followed suit, implementing 25% tariffs on American goods and new duties of up to 15%, targeting US agricultural exports. For corporate America, Trump’s economic policies that involve tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks have been largely welcomed by businesses. Still, many executives fear that the new trade barriers caused by tariffs could nerf the benefits of any of the president’s pro-business policies. The White House has portrayed the tariffs as a strategic sacrifice, a necessary step in making sure the US and its currency lead global markets. Economists see the administration’s approach as a chess move, where short-term pain is a small price to pay for long-term gain. They also do not expect President Trump to fall back from his trading policies, no matter the cost. “Next to tax cuts and more lenient regulations, sure, the levies are an unsavory part of the equation,” one industry executive remarked. “But they’ll still be better off under Trump’s broader economic plan when all is said and done.” Wall Street feels echoes of a global economic crisis Since Washington first spoke about trade tariffs, global economic experts have repeatedly sounded the alarm over the consequences of Trump’s strategy. Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce, cautioned that the situation risks driving markets into a fall reminiscent of the Great Depression. “Our deep concern is that this could be the start of a downward spiral that puts us in 1930s trade-war territory,” Wilson said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal . He also mentioned the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which imposed steep duties on foreign imports and contributed to a worldwide economic collapse. According to research from the International Monetary Fund , that downturn led to mass unemployment, with nearly a third of the global workforce left without jobs. “The likelihood of a similarly severe blow to the global economy is high,” Wilson said. “Right now, it’s a coin flip. It comes down to whether the U.S. administration is willing to rethink the utility of tariffs.” Neil Shearing of Capital Economics believes Trump’s trade war risks driving a wedge between the US and its allies, which could muddle any efforts for America to counter China’s growing economic influence. “The Trump tariffs risk widening a fissure within the group of nations largely aligned with Washington, complicating collective action against an emboldened Beijing and isolating the US on the global stage,” he wrote in a research note published Tuesday.

While over the past year, bitcoin’s total returns have matched those of gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, when adjusting for risk, bitcoin is behaving more like a major stock index. Risk-adjusted returns measure an asset's profitability relative to its price swings. A higher ratio suggests strong returns with lower volatility. After a number of violent price swings of late alongside trade war threats, growing geopolitical tensions and President Trump's sowing confusion over government plans with respect to crypto, bitcoin is modestly lower so far in 2025. Gold, meanwhile, is up more than 11% year-to-date. ""Bitcoin and gold are completely uncorrelated at the moment, on a 20-day moving average on a five year time frame it is negative,"" said CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten. ""You can typically see when the correlation goes negative this is usually when bitcoin is at a bottom which can be seen in early 2023, summer of 2023, summer of 2024 and now. BTC tends to catch up with gold."" The shift could impact Bitcoin’s appeal to institutional investors, who often prioritize assets with favorable risk-reward profiles. While Bitcoin's long-term narrative as ""digital gold"" remains intact, its short-term performance suggests it may be behaving more like equities than a safe-haven asset.",Markets|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 15:37:08

Investors initially took Trump’s pro-crypto stances as a bullish signal. However, there has been a lack of clarity on proposed regulatory changes. The controversial launches of the President and the First Lady’s memecoins shook investor confidence . On March 2, Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to $94,000 following the commander-in-chief’s announcement that a strategic cryptocurrency reserve would be created. Despite an initial wave of optimism, Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico on March 4 sent a shockwave through financial markets. This culminated in a risk asset sell-off that saw $80 billion wiped out from the crypto market within a day. Although there are plenty of silver linings to be found, and these pullbacks might very well turn out to be temporary, investing in Bitcoin when Trump took office would not have secured a profit as of March 5. Let’s take a closer look at the exact figures of this hypothetical trade. Bitcoin has seen a double-digit decrease in price since Donald Trump’s inauguration Donald Trump’s second term as President started on January 20. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at a price of $101,280. Since the time of Trump’s inauguration, Bitcoin has failed to break through to the upside in a meaningful manner, and recent developments have caused a sharp correction in the price of the leading digital asset. By press time on March 5, Bitcoin was changing hands at a price of $89,590. BTC price year-to-date (YTD) chart. Source: Finbold That figure equates to an 11.54% drop from January 20. Accordingly, a $1,000 investment made on the day that Donald Trump took office again would now be worth $884.60, with a net loss of $115.40. In contrast, at the time of the election, Bitcoin was trading at $68,290. Investors who made a $1,000 investment on that fateful November 5 day would have benefitted from a 31.19% surge, and their position would now be worth $1,311, for a $311 gain. Lastly, readers should note that per Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump will reveal a strategy for his long-awaited Bitcoin Reserve at the inaugural White House Crypto Summit on Friday, March 7. While not many specifics are known at this time, the summit has the potential to set the tone not just for Bitcoin, but the wider cryptocurrency market going forward — and that tone could very well be bullish.

It rose 8% and moved back above the crucial resistance at $90,000. BTC price will continue to react to the latest trade news and the upcoming US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data. Bitcoin Price Rises After China Vows to Retaliate on US Tariffs BTC and other risky assets jumped on Wednesday, even after China vowed to retaliate against Donald Trump’s tariffs . The retaliation came after Trump boosted his China tariffs from 10% to 20%, a move that will affect trade volume worth billions of dollars. China has already announced some retaliatory measures. It will levy up to 15% on some US goods on top of the other tariffs it announced last month. Some of these tariffs target sensitive areas of the American economy like agriculture. Also, the government added more American companies to its unreliable entity list and vowed to appeal at the World Trade Organization. Therefore, Bitcoin price and stocks jumped because the Trump administration appeared to soften its stand on tariffs. Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary, said that the US will be willing to negotiate with the affected countries. Traders also believe that Trump simply wants concessions from its top trading partners. US Nonfarm Payroll Data Ahead Bitcoin price is also rising ahead of the upcoming US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data on Friday. Analysts anticipate that the labor market softened in February because of Elon Musk’s DOGE job cuts. An ADP report showed that the private payrolls crashed to 77k in February from 186k a month earlier. Weak jobs numbers would be bullish for BTC price because they would boost the odds of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Indeed, US bond yields have crashed , raising odds of more rate cuts. The NFP report will come on the day that Donald Trump will have his crypto summit , where he will talk about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserves . Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis Bears seem to have won the Bitcoin price battle for now as it crashed from $109,200 to $90,000 today. The bulls vs bears power has crashed below zero for two consecutive weeks. While this is often a negative thing, historical data shows that Bitcoin often rebounds when the indicator turns red. For example, it crashed in August last year, leading to a strong rally. It also remained below zero in 2021 and then surged. Bitcoin is also forming a hammer candlestick pattern that often leads to a breakout. If this happens, it will be the second consecutive hammer that may lead to a strong bullish breakout. On top of this, Bitcoin is yet to hit the $122,000 target of the cup and handle pattern . This target was established by measuring the cup’s depth and then measuring the same distance from the upper side. Bitcoin Price Chart Therefore, a contrarian case can be made even as the crypto fear and greed index remained in the red. More robust gains will be confirmed if the coin rises above the key resistance at $108,426. A drop below the support at $73,620 will invalidate the BTC price forecast and point to a crash to $50,000.

A large holder was able to profit by taking out a 50x long on a $4 million position before the announcement, making a stunning $68 million in the process. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have taken a beating, leaving traders in a state of confusion. But while the market dips, Rollblock (RBLK) is making serious waves. With its presale moving at record speed, some investors believe it could rally up to 50x this year. As major exchange listings approach, those who act fast could lock in massive upside. Rollblock (RBLK): Stage 10 Coins Selling Fast as Momentum Grows The $500 billion gaming industry is undergoing a radical shift, and Rollblock ( RBLK ) is leading the way. Its blockchain-based GameFi platform is setting new standards for transparency, with every bid and payout recorded on the Ethereum chain. This radical approach is inspiring explosive growth, with signups, deposits, and wagered bids all hitting new highs month after month. An army of early investors is rushing to secure a piece of the action. Rollblock’s presale has already attracted $10.8 million in inflows, and Stage 10 tokens are disappearing fast. Over 40% have already been snapped up at just $0.06, and with major exchange listings on the horizon, it’s certain that prices won’t stay this low for long. The platform boasts over 7,000 classic games, including poker and slots, along with a cutting-edge sports prediction league. Fiat deposits are now enabled via Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard, eliminating the last major entry barrier for new users to join the revolution. What Makes RBLK Such a Top-Tier Investment? Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model gives it a serious edge in the gaming niche. The platform reinvests 30% of its revenue into buying RBLK from decentralized exchanges. Of these buybacks, 60% are burned immediately to reduce the total supply, while 40% ends up funding staking rewards of up to 30% APY for loyal holders. Stage 10 tokens are selling at lightning speed, with more than 40% already spoken for. With prices set to rise soon, early investors are positioning themselves for significant gains. Those who refer a friend in March can both claim a 30% RBLK bonus, plus a 20% purchase bonus right now.

Trump announced that Solana will form part of his government’s strategic crypto reserve, leading to a short-lived pump this weekend. Solana strongly rejected its critical horizontal support level if price surpasses the $150 mark and continues momentum we will be set to see solana hit $3. Many Solana holders expect a sharp recovery, with Solana targeting $500 in 2025 as momentum builds again. Cardano (ADA): Looking Bullish Back Above $1 Level Cardano shows signs of bullish momentum, retracing back above the $1 level, Despite a slight dip to $0.87 amid a broader market decline, Cardano’s resilience shines through, battling market volatility. Its holding the $1 support with a move to the upside, we could see potential for further gains. Many long-term Cardano holders are going even further and are now targeting a rally to $2.50 in the coming months. Rollblock Offers Transparency in Contrast to Insider Trading Suspicions Insider trading speculation and market sell-offs may rattle investors, but Rollblock (RBLK) keeps on impressing with the strength of its offering. Its presale tokens are selling at record speed, and the upside potential is undeniable at this point, with $1 targets being made by those in the know.

ARB is currently trading at $0.42 having slumped to an all-time low of $0.35 on Tuesday. Trading volume is also up by 10% to $400 million over the past 24 hours. Total value locked (TVL) has remained steady on Arbitrum of late, standing at $2.8 billion having risen from $2.5 billion at the start of November, according to DefiLlama . But that relative success has not equated to success in terms of token price, with ARB now 82% down from 2024's record high of $2.41. This is partly due to token emissions; since March 2024 circulating supply has increased from 1.5 billion to 4.4 billion, which means that the market cap has remained more stable than the price itself. Market cap is worked out by multiplying circulating supply with asset price. ARB was not the only token to be listed on Robinhood, it joins XRP, shiba inu (SHIB), and bonk (BONK), all of which rose between 4.5% and 7% on Wednesday. The extended rise of ARB compared to the other listed tokens could be due to the fact that it is the leading layer-2 network in terms of total value secured (TVS) and user operations per second (UOPS), according to L2Beat .

XRP News: Ripple Whales Sparks Market Buzz The latest bullish XRP news seen by traders and investors remains heightened transfers despite the broader market volatility. According to analyst Ali Martinez’s X post on March 5, over $5.37 billion worth of XRP was moved in the past 24 hours. Source: Ali Martinez, X This massive mover by Ripple whales emerges in tandem with Donald Trump’s recent announcement to include XRP in the U.S. crypto reserve . Other crypto like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) are also highly anticipated to be included in the reserve. As an upshot, XRP transfers rose substantially amid market participants abuzz with the crypto reserve announcement.

Attorney Jeremy Hogan recently hinted that an early dismissal of the XRP lawsuit is possible. Reportedly, the American blockchain company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, might participate in the upcoming White House crypto summit. This endeavor has further sparked market discussions over its potential impact on the ongoing lawsuit.

This article explores the factors that could influence their climb in the market. Delving into key elements, it aims to offer insights into which of these coins might be poised for significant growth. Discover what could drive their potential rise. XRP Shows Remarkable Long-Term Growth Amidst Recent Volatility XRP experienced a 5.25% weekly uptick and a 5.33% decline over the past month. Over the last six months, the coin surged an impressive 347.74%, showcasing strong long-term resilience despite short-term fluctuations. While XRP’s recent performance has been mixed, its longer-term trajectory remains robust and appealing to traders, indicating potential for further gains. Currently, XRP trades between $1.60 and $2.88, with key resistance levels at $3.61 and $4.89 and support around $1.06. The signal indicators suggest a neutral market stance, with a slight bearish lean from the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator, while the RSI sits near 48.32. This environment suggests trading within defined levels, focusing on strategic entries around the support area and targets near the resistance zone. Ondo Market Review: 6-Month Surge, 1-Month Decline and Key Levels Ondo's price analysis shows a one-month drop of 22.60% following a robust six-month gain of 70.01%. Price action has fluctuated between $0.75 and $1.37, reflecting recent short-term weakness amid a longer-term bullish run. The asset experienced significant volatility, with a strong upward trend over the past half-year yet a notable pullback in the last month. Current prices remain bound between $0.75 and $1.37, with immediate resistance at $1.74 and support near $0.51. Bears have taken control of the short-term market, indicated by negative momentum markers and a lower RSI close to 38.63. The trend remains unclear, suggesting traders should monitor these key levels for possible breakouts or further declines. Conclusion XRP and ONDO have shown significant potential for growth by 2025. Market trends, technological advancements, and adoption rates will play crucial roles in their future value. XRP's strong institutional support and ONDO's unique features position them for possible substantial gains. Pricing models suggest that both cryptocurrencies could experience notable increases if positive conditions persist. Careful monitoring of market dynamics and ongoing developments remains essential for accurate valuation forecasts. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As investors rushed to secure profits from Trump’s crypto reserve announcement, the market quickly erased most of its gains. Despite the increased selling pressure and overall bearish momentum, Rollblock remains in the green, holding strong with a 600% surge. While major tokens like Cardano are experiencing daily drops of 10-15%, Rollblock continues outperforming the market. Its resilience comes from its game-changing approach to a $450 billion industry, bringing blockchain security to online gaming and setting a new standard for transparency and trust. Analysts See Cardano Surge After the Strategic Reserve Announcement Hype Dials Down Cardano surged after Donald Trump announced the U.S. Crypto Reserve, naming Cardano, XRP, and Solana alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump emphasized that the initiative would “elevate the critical industry” after years of regulatory challenges. The announcement sparked a 60% surge in just two hours, pushing ADA from $0.64 to $1, its highest level in over a month. The rally extended to $1.17, marking an 80% rebound from its Friday low of $0.58. However, profit-taking and market uncertainty led to a sharp pullback. ADA has since dropped 13% in the last 24 hours, now trading around $0.83. The decline followed Trump’s confirmation of a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports and an expected 10% tariff on Chinese goods. The announcement rattled markets, prompting investors to reduce exposure to risk assets like ADA. Despite short-term selling pressure, large investors are accumulating. Santiment data shows whales holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA purchased over 200 million tokens in 24 hours, signaling strong institutional interest. Cardano’s network activity is also rising. DappRadar reports a 13% increase in unique active wallets, while daily transactions have surged 200% to 17,120. DefiLlama data shows Cardano’s TVL has climbed 21.54% to $357.5 million, reinforcing investor confidence. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez sees a bullish breakout if ADA closes above $1.19, with a potential rally to $2.20 an 84% upside. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlights a potential “Power of 3” pattern, suggesting further momentum ahead.

While the broader crypto market is struggling currently, ether (ETH) appears to be getting hit the hardest compared to its rivals, as seen in the asset’s on-chain metrics. The latest data analyzed by the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant has found that the profit levels for ETH holders have fallen to levels seen during the last bear cycle. Whales’ Profit Ratio Hits Bear Market Levels According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the unrealized profit ratio for ETH whales—traders holding at least 100,000 ETH—has fallen to bear market levels. This cohort of investors last saw this level of unrealized profits in January 2023 and the months before then. Darkfost said that most whales’ positions have returned to the same profit levels recorded during the previous bear market. This is despite the fact that ETH is currently almost twice its value from the last bear season. While the unrealized profit ratio for traders holding at least 100,000 ETH just fell to former bear market levels, the metric for the cohort holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH has reverted to negative unrealized profit ratio levels. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio continues to decline, with the metric facing a combination of intense fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) and complex price action. Data from TradingView reveals the ETH/BTC price at a five-year low of 0.0246, following a state of constant decline since 2022. Tough Time for ETH Holders This period of difficulty for Ethereum can also be seen in ETH price, which has plummeted 15% monthly and 10% weekly. After a brief surge on Sunday due to news of the United States creating a strategic crypto reserve, including ETH, the cryptocurrency fell more than 20% from $2,541 to $2,019 within 24 hours. At the time of writing, ETH had recovered slightly and was changing hands at $2,232, depicting a 6% uptick daily. At ether’s current price, it is almost 50% below its December 2024 peak above $4,000. Market analysts have predicted that ETH could fall to late 2022 lows of $1,200 after identifying a double-top formation from the asset’s monthly time frame chart. This is likely to happen if ETH breaks below its $2,100 support level.

Speaking to independent news outlet The Pavlovic Today , Lutnick stated that the President “definitely thinks there’s a bitcoin strategic reserve” and will unveil plans for it during the White House’s inaugural crypto summit on Friday. JUST IN: Commerce Secretary says President Trump will unveil a #Bitcoin reserve strategy at the White House Crypto Summit. pic.twitter.com/PiwIMznoag — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 5, 2025 Lutnick hinted that bitcoin would have a “unique status” compared to other cryptocurrencies under the reserve framework. “Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently—positively, but differently,” he remarked. The Commerce Secretary’s comments align with President Trump’s recent social media posts supporting the creation of a crypto reserve anchored by bitcoin. The President stated the reserve would “elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration.” Lutnick’s preview of the announcement propelled bitcoin over $90,000 this week from under $85,000 on Monday. The overall crypto market surged back above $3 trillion ahead of the summit. Friday’s gathering will convene top bitcoin and crypto executives, investors, and regulators to map out a framework for crypto oversight and innovation in the U.S. Attendees include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor, and others. The summit follows Trump’s executive order directing officials to prioritize the “responsible growth of digital assets.” The President aims to reposition the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world” after strict policies under Biden stifled innovation. With bipartisan support growing for bitcoin and crypto-friendly laws in Congress, Trump’s embrace of a strategic bitcoin reserve may cement their legitimacy worldwide.

The firm’s report points to impressive use cases and incoming mass institutional adoption for both assets. 2025 Will Be The Year Of The Altcoins, Says WisdomTree After the regulatory milestones achieved by Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2024, WisdomTree says 2025 will see altcoins record similar wins. WisdomTree’s Market Outlook predicts that key jurisdictions will warm up to exchange-traded funds for top altcoins in 2025. The report specifically mentions XRP and Solana as altcoins expected to receive ETPs in global markets. Analysts at WisdomTree say both assets have demonstrated potential as “institutional-grade investment vehicles.” For Solana, its capabilities for NFTs, DApps, and DeFi make it a top blockchain in the cryptoverse. On the other hand, XRP is carving a niche for itself in cross-border and global settlements. “By approving ETPs for assets such as Solana and XRP, regulators would broaden the spectrum of crypto investment opportunities,” read the report. At the moment, billions in ETF outflows from BTC and ETH have dampened the enthusiasm of investors, triggering interest in new ETPs. The report highlights Solana’s stablecoin functionalities and XRP Ledger’s near-instant transaction as part of the reasons for ETP approvals. WisdomTree analysts say the approvals open doors to nearly “$300 trillion of managed wealth.” The Inclusion In A Crypto Strategic Reserve Underscores XRP and SOL’s Relevance SOL and XRP made the cut for a US Crypto Strategic Reserve , accentuating their growing institutional influence. The announcement sent asset prices surging to new highs amid whispers of a flippening for Ethereum. XRP’s case with the SEC is inching toward a dismissal with analysts predicting May as the end to the lawsuit. Frank Templeton has filed an S-1 with the SEC to launch a Solana spot ETF, fuelling speculation for a fresh rally. Experts say the approval for the Solana ETF will happen in 2025, citing a change in stances by the SEC.

Shortly before, one of the largest centralised exchanges, Binance, announced a procedure to delist MiCA-compliant staples, including Tether's flagship USDT , for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, despite the scheduled 31 March trading exclusion, Binance has made it clear that it will continue to provide deposits and withdrawals using ” unwanted ” staples, adding fuel to the fire of regulatory uncertainty. According to ESMA's position, the provision of custodial and transfer services for such assets does not fall under a breach of European cryptocurrency law, leaving room for manoeuvre for exchanges and users alike. ”Focusing on MiCA, the provision of custody and transaction services for non-compliant assets, do not constitute a public offer or admission to trading,” commented an ESMA spokesperson. ”These services are therefore not explicitly prohibited under Titles III and IV of MiCA.” While the Regulator has made such statements, it has also emphasised that European cryptoasset service providers (CASPs) are obliged to limit the ability to interact with these types of assets , referring to its guidance issued on 17 January 2025 . This requirement must be met by 31 March for investors to successfully close out their positions. At the same time, ESMA's confirmation that MiCA requirements do not restrict interactions involving custody or transactions involving USDT, together with the recommendation for CASP to suspend withdrawals before 31 March , adds ambiguity to this issue. Juan Ignacio Ibáñez , who is a member of MiCA's tech committee, has previously said that the delisting of USDT due to regulatory requirements will be a point of contention. Confusion over MiCA's implications for incompatible stablecoins is not the only area of debate regarding Europe's new cryptocurrency regulations. Many crypto analysts have already said that there will be questions about MICA compliance, because it does not provide clarity on the regulation of RWAs, and other industries. ”ESMA and other competent authorities are closely monitoring the market environment to ensure a centralised transition to the MiCA regime,” said an ESMA spokesperson.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,USDT|REGULATION|MARKET|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-05 15:53:55

The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 8% and is trading around $90,100 as bulls attempt to build momentum and push towards $95,000. Markets began recovering after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly stated Trump could roll back tariffs against Canada and Mexico, with an announcement likely on March 5. South Korea May Approve Bitcoin ETFs South Korea’s financial regulators are monitoring Japan’s moves towards approving Bitcoin ETFs. Some reports have suggested Seoul may follow Tokyo if it takes further action and approves the ETFs. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has discussed approving the ETFs but maintains a cautious stance towards crypto. However, recent developments in Japan could change their conservative approach towards crypto. The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering reclassifying cryptocurrency as an investment tool and approving Bitcoin ETFs. The shift in stance has caught the attention of South Korean regulators. The FSA plans to implement new regulations by June, setting the stage for further legislative changes by 2025 or 2026. Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Six-Month Low Bitcoin’s open interest has hit a six-month low, a level last seen when BTC traded between $50,000 and $60,000 before surging towards $100,000. One analyst has pointed out that this pattern has previously signaled market bottoms, indicating Bitcoin could be ready for a comeback. “Bitcoin's open interest crashes to 6-month low! But here's the thing: the last time this happened, BTC rallied to $100k! Is history about to repeat itself?” BTC’s funding rate has also dipped into negative territory, an indicator that typically precedes a strong upward push. The RSI is also below the neutral zone, indicating BTC could rebound. However, BTC must reclaim key resistance levels before a bullish reversal can be confirmed. “If You Missed It: The $BTC RSI is below 30, which indicates BTC is significantly oversold! The last time we went below a 30 RSI was early August when BTC hit a bottom of $50k before soaring over 115% and smashing a new all-time high!” Trump Crypto Plan And Market Uncertainty Fueling Volatility BTC’s weekend jump was driven by Donald Trump’s announcement of a crypto strategic reserve that would hold XRP, SOL, and ADA. The brief exclusion of BTC and ETH sparked confusion and panic before Trump confirmed their inclusion in a follow-up post, boosting prices. However, the rally lost momentum due to several factors, including criticism from the industry about the inclusion of assets besides BTC , dampening the initial euphoria around the announcement. Macroeconomic uncertainty and tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China triggered a broader risk-off move, leading to a substantial decline on Monday. El Salvador Adds To BTC Reserve El Salvador had added 1 BTC to its Bitcoin reserve, taking its total holdings to 6,101.18 BTC , valued at $527 million. The acquisition reinforces President Nayib Bukele’s commitment to strengthen El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. The country’s National Bitcoin Office confirmed the purchase on March 4. The move aligns with El Salvador’s “1 BTC a day” accumulation strategy aimed at economic diversification and acting as a hedge against inflation. It also indicates El Salvador’s confidence in BTC despite recent volatility. The country’s latest acquisition comes as it adjusts its Bitcoin policies to align with the $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). El Salvador recently modified its Bitcoin law, making its use voluntary instead of mandatory. Despite the adjustment, El Salvador continues to bolster its Bitcoin reserves. The country has added 46 BTC worth $3.97 million in the past 30 days. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded over the past couple of sessions as it looks to rebound from Monday’s crash. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 7% in the past 24 hours, rebounding from a low of $81,485 to briefly cross $90,000 before settling at its current level. BTC faces resistance at $90,000 and $92,000, with sellers preventing a push higher. BTC traded in the red for most of the previous week, starting with a drop of nearly 5% on Monday. BTC continued to drop on Tuesday as it slipped below $90,000 on its way to an intraday low of $85,985. The price recovered from this level but could not reclaim $90,000, ultimately settling at $88,654 after a drop of 3.24%. BTC continued to decline on Wednesday, dropping over 5% to $84,129 as selling pressure intensified. BTC recovered on Thursday despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, reaching an intraday high of $87,045 before settling at $84,657 after a marginal increase. Source: TradingView The price plunged below $80,000 and the 200-day SMA on Friday, falling to a low of $78,179. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $80,000 and cross the 200-day SMA to settle at $84,362, registering a marginal decline. BTC recovered on Saturday, rising over 2% and settling at $86,182. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday following Donald Trump’s announcement about the strategic reserve. As a result, BTC surged over 9% to reclaim $90,000 and move past the 20-day SMA to settle at $94,322. However, the rally was short-lived as prices crashed on Monday, with BTC dropping 8.61% to $86,201. The price plunged to an intraday low of $81,485 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of nearly 2% and settle at $87,300. The current session sees BTC up over 1% and trading at $88,364 after briefly crossing $90,000 and reaching a high of $90,980. The RSI is below the neutral zone but pointing upwards, indicating a waning bearish sentiment. The MACD also suggests bears are weakening. If BTC reclaims and consolidates above $90,000, it could indicate a change in sentiment. If BTC can settle above the 20-day SMA, it could open the door for a retest of $100,000. On the other hand, if the price drops below $85,000, we could see a decline to $80,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This crypto coin is Rexas Finance (RXS), and currently, it is in the final presale stage where it has sold almost 90% of its token with the window closing fast and listing around the corner. Rexas Finance (RXS) Poised for 23,914% Surge as Investors Shift from Dogecoin to RWAs! Rexas Finance establishes itself as a transformative crypto enterprise by using RWAs to target a vital market segment that remains unexploited primarily. The token’s strategy connects conventional assets to digital economic systems, thus creating an appealing investment opportunity for people who want to grow their value.

The current RXS presale stage 12 has achieved an outstanding milestone by reaching 89.97% of its $56,000,000 funding objective, resulting in $45,965,911. The high level of investor interest in RXS is demonstrated by the quick sell-out of 449,827,268 tokens from the total 500,000,000 token supply. The current presale price of $0.200 for RXS presents investors with a unique chance to buy before its official $0.25 listing date on June 19, 2025. RXS development tracks directly with the blockchain industry’s growing interest in Real World Asset solutions. The market allows the tokenization of physical assets to create tradable digital tokens that utilize this opportunity. The process enables real estate investments alongside art acquisitions to become more liquid by creating new market accessibility for these tangible assets. RXS distinguishes itself by building a platform that combines RWAs with the ability to bring together traditional investors and those who work in crypto markets.

The predicted 23,914% market value increase during the next five months has ignited discussions across crypto communities, driving additional people to explore RXS opportunities. Presale statistics of RXS demonstrate a rising market demand. The fundraising target at RXS has already reached 89% of its goal, indicating a strong market acceptance. The extensive fundraising amount demonstrates that investors are enthusiastic and confident about this project. Those participating in the presale can lock in their investments before the official launch because the current price is $0.200 with the listing price set at $0.25. The project benefits from being listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms, which provides extra credibility to RXS. The Certik audit demonstrates Rexas Finance’s dedication toward enhanced transparency and security while assuring investors about token integrity. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Conclusion As Dogecoin investors pivot towards RXS, the excitement around Rexas Finance(RXS) is palpable, with a prediction of a 23,914% rise, focus on a multi-trillion dollar industry first of its kind, RXS is capturing the attention of many investors.

The rule establishes that custody over funds is not necessary to be deemed a broker by the IRS, obliging “DeFi front-end services” to report trading activity via the 1099 tax form to the agency. This includes any developer of “screens, buttons, forms, and other visual elements incorporated in websites, mobile device apps, and browser extensions—that users can use to trade digital assets in their unhosted wallets”. With its broker rule, the IRS deems said developers to have a certain amount of “control” over the offered services, despite never taking custody of coins and the lack of ability to influence the underlying protocols – the rule is in line with digital asset guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which deems developers of user interfaces to qualify as Virtual Asset Service Providers subject to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism obligations. Similar to FATF, the broker rule defines control as “the ability to amend, update, or otherwise substantively affect the terms under which the services are provided,” as well as “the ability to collect the fees charged for those services from the transaction flow whether or not the person actually collects fees in this manner,” and/or if that person has the ability “to add to the order a sequence of instructions to query the cryptographically secured distributed ledger to determine if the processed order is, in fact, executed or to use another method of confirmation based on information known to that person as a result of providing the trading front-end services.” In light of such enormous overreach – control over funds has been widely understood as a prerequisite to be regulated as a financial service according to FinCEN guidance – the industry moved quickly. A day after publication of the rule, the Blockchain Association filed a lawsuit against the IRS and the Treasury Department, asking federal judges to strike the rule down before it takes effect, alleging that the rule is unconstitutional and contrary to existing federal laws. In addition to the suit, Senator Ted Cruz introduced a joint resolution to disapprove of the IRS’ rule by Congressional power, co-sponsored by Senator Cynthia Lummis, Senator Bill Hagerty, Senator Mike Lee, and Senator Tim Scott, among others. “This regulation undermines the purpose of DeFi technology: to enable individuals to freely buy, sell, and exchange digital assets,” Cruz said in a press release regarding the resolution. Representative Corey, who introduced the resolution together with Cruz, called the rule a “clear overreach”. The resolution was voted on yesterday in the Senate, with overwhelming support of 70 to 27 in favor, and will now move for a vote in the House. The broker rule is another effort of the Biden administration to extend control over non-custodial services. In both the criminal prosecution of Samourai Developers, as well as the criminal prosecution of Tornado Cash developers, the US Department of Justice is alleging that control over funds is not necessary to be held liable as a money service business under US law, arguing that the development of user interfaces and other features demonstrate enough control over a service to be subjected to sanctions, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regulations. While the possible overturning of the broker rule would no doubt be a success, the sentencing of Samourai and Tornado Cash developers would yield similar results regarding reporting requirements for non-custodial service providers. To clarify that non-custodial service providers are exempt from being classified as money service businesses, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act by Representative Tom Emmer has been introduced to Congress, offering widespread protections for developers.

What initially seemed like a simple case of theft quickly unraveled into a deeper plot, exposing the risky underbelly of in-person cryptocurrency transactions. Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating case that has gripped the attention of the crypto community and law enforcement alike. Failed Crypto Robbery: A Detailed Breakdown The incident, which unfolded recently, involved a South Korean man in his 30s and two Chinese nationals. According to reports from Newsis, the suspect orchestrated a meeting under the guise of purchasing cryptocurrency. However, his true intentions were far from legitimate. Instead of engaging in a genuine crypto deal, he planned to rob the Chinese nationals of their assets. Here’s a breakdown of how the failed robbery unfolded: The Setup: The suspect arranged a meeting with two Chinese nationals, seemingly to buy cryptocurrency. The location and time were presumably chosen by the suspect to facilitate his planned crime. False Alarm: After the encounter, the suspect contacted the police, making a false claim that he was robbed of 30 million won (approximately $20,600). This initial report was likely an attempt to mislead the authorities and perhaps even frame the Chinese nationals. Truth Unveiled: Police investigations quickly revealed the suspect’s deception. It turned out he was not the victim but the perpetrator of the attempted robbery. His fabricated story crumbled under scrutiny. Swift Arrest: Based on the evidence gathered, South Korean police promptly arrested the man. He now faces serious charges related to his criminal actions. Charges and Further Investigation: Currently, the suspect is charged with attempted robbery. Authorities are also considering adding charges for obstructing official duties due to his false police report. This case serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with in-person cryptocurrency transactions, especially when dealing with unknown parties. It also highlights the effectiveness of South Korean law enforcement in swiftly addressing and resolving such cryptocurrency crime incidents. Why South Korea and Crypto Crime? South Korea has emerged as a significant hub for cryptocurrency trading and adoption. This prominence, however, also makes it a landscape where crypto robbery and related crimes can occur. Several factors contribute to this: High Crypto Adoption: South Korea has one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency adoption globally. A significant portion of the population is involved in crypto trading and investment, creating a large market and potential targets for criminals. Tech-Savvy Population: The country boasts a highly tech-savvy population, comfortable with digital transactions and technologies. This familiarity extends to cryptocurrencies, but also to potential exploitation by criminals who are equally tech-adept. Large Trading Volumes: Major South Korean exchanges consistently handle substantial cryptocurrency trading volumes. This liquidity and activity can attract both legitimate users and those with malicious intent. Anonymity and Decentralization: The inherent anonymity and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can be exploited by criminals looking to conduct illicit activities, including robbery and theft, as tracing and recovering stolen crypto can be complex. The Arrest: A Win for Law Enforcement? The swift arrest in this case can be seen as a positive sign. It demonstrates the capability of South Korean law enforcement to investigate and respond effectively to cryptocurrency-related crimes. Here’s why this arrest is significant: Deterrent Effect: Publicizing such arrests can act as a deterrent to potential criminals. Knowing that law enforcement is actively pursuing and successfully prosecuting crypto-related crimes can discourage others from attempting similar acts. Building Public Trust: Successful resolution of crypto crime cases helps build public trust in the ability of authorities to protect digital assets. This is crucial for the continued growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies within society. Enhanced Investigative Capabilities: Each case provides valuable learning opportunities for law enforcement agencies. Investigating crypto robbery and fraud requires specialized skills and understanding of blockchain technology. Successful arrests indicate growing expertise in this area. International Cooperation: In cases involving foreign nationals, like this one with Chinese nationals, it highlights the importance of international cooperation in tackling cross-border crypto crimes. Protecting Yourself from Cryptocurrency Crime While law enforcement plays a crucial role, individual vigilance and proactive security measures are paramount in protecting yourself from becoming a victim of cryptocurrency crime . Here are some actionable insights to consider: Exercise Caution with In-Person Transactions: Whenever possible, avoid in-person cryptocurrency transactions, especially with unknown individuals. Opt for reputable exchanges and platforms for buying and selling crypto. Use Secure Wallets: Employ hardware wallets or reputable software wallets to store your cryptocurrencies securely. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers: Be extremely cautious of unsolicited investment offers or deals that seem too good to be true. Scammers often use social engineering tactics to lure victims. Verify Counterparties: If in-person transactions are unavoidable, conduct thorough due diligence on the counterparty. Meet in secure, public places and inform someone of your plans. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated on the latest cryptocurrency scams and security threats. Knowledge is your best defense against falling victim to crime. The Future of Crypto Security in South Korea As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow in South Korea and globally, ensuring the security of digital assets will remain a top priority. The South Korea arrest in this failed robbery case is a step in the right direction, but ongoing efforts are needed. This includes: Strengthening Legal Frameworks: Governments and regulatory bodies need to continuously adapt legal frameworks to effectively address the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency crime. Clear regulations and enforcement mechanisms are essential. Technological Advancements: Continued development and deployment of blockchain analytics and forensic tools are crucial for tracking illicit crypto transactions and identifying criminals. Public Awareness Campaigns: Raising public awareness about cryptocurrency risks and security best practices is vital. Educating users is key to preventing many types of crypto crime. Collaboration Between Stakeholders: Effective crypto security requires collaboration between law enforcement, exchanges, wallet providers, and the crypto community as a whole. Sharing information and best practices is essential. Conclusion: A Stark Reminder of Crypto Risks The failed robbery attempt and subsequent arrest in South Korea serve as a dramatic and shocking illustration of the real-world risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. While the digital realm offers incredible opportunities, it also presents challenges in terms of security and crime. This incident underscores the need for vigilance, robust security measures, and continued efforts from law enforcement and the crypto industry to create a safer environment for everyone involved in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. The swift action of South Korean police provides a glimmer of hope and a strong message that cryptocurrency crime will not go unpunished.

She believes the Trump and Musk are pressing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reduce the workforce to obscure tax delays for billionaires in America. On Wednesday, Warren reposted an article from the Associated Press on X with the quote: “ Donald Trump and Elon Musk are happy to make you wait for your tax refund, just so the wealthy can cheat on their taxes. How is that efficient? ” The AP news talked about a potential IRS staff cuts that could eliminate nearly half of its workforce. According to sources familiar with the situation, the agency is drafting plans to reduce its workforce through layoffs, attrition, and incentivized buyouts. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the IRS currently employs approximately 90,000 workers across the United States. Data from the office’s records shows that 56% of its workforce consists of people of color, and 65% are women. In February, around 7,000 probationary employees, those with one year or less of service, were already laid off as part of the downsizing effort. Trump’s administration plans to shrink the federal government is led by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. The department was created to overhaul federal agencies and is now pushing for a reduction in government employee numbers, including nearly all probationary workers who have yet to secure civil service protections. Warren condemns Trump’s tax policies In a video posted after Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, she called the US President’s remarks “layers and layers of ugliness, distraction, and crazy stories that would make a fact-checker’s head explode.” Donald Trump is handing our country over to a handful of billionaires. pic.twitter.com/jtrZyp9gB6 — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 5, 2025 “ I think Trump and Republicans in Congress have a plan to cut taxes for billionaires and to make everyone else pay for it, ” Warren said. “ And the best way to slip through a plan like that is to throw up a handful of sand after another, hoping that nobody will actually see what’s happening. “ She went on to accuse Trump of handing America over to “a handful of billionaires.” At a press conference held yesterday evening, Warren was joined by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Senator Ed Markey, and the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation. Among those joining Warren was Doug Kowalewski, a former National Science Foundation employee from Wellesley. Kowalewski was among those unexpectedly dismissed as part of the workforce reductions initiated by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. He had previously shared his story at Warren’s town hall in Framingham, Massachusetts. The group condemned what they described as Trump’s agenda to benefit billionaires at the expense of working-class Americans. Warren referred to the first six weeks of Trump’s new administration as a “sandstorm of chaos,” arguing that the “distraction tactics” were meant to push through trillions in tax cuts that would gut healthcare, Social Security, and other programs that “mommas, daddies, babies and seniors rely on.” Warren: ‘Billionaires win, families lose’ Continuing with her statement , Warren pointed a finger at Trump and Musk for systematically dismantling the federal government to serve the interests of the wealthy. “ Trump and his unelected co-president Elon Musk are dismantling our government, piece by piece so that it works better for those same billionaires and worse for everyone else ,” she said. “ The whole Republican plan fits on a bumper sticker: Billionaires win; families lose .” She further accused Trump of failing to deliver on promises to lower costs, instead slashing funding for medical research and laying off government employees responsible for airline safety, nuclear materials security, and food inspection. On Wednesday morning, she doubled down on her stance against the alleged tax breaks for the wealthy, posting on X: “ I won’t vote to give tax breaks to billionaires. “ Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This unfortunate incident resulted in approximately $9.5 million being siphoned from the platform. However, in a swift and reassuring move, zkLend has demonstrated its commitment to its users by launching a dedicated recovery portal. This portal is designed to facilitate the refund process for users impacted by the exploit. Let’s dive into the details of this incident, understand the implications, and explore how zkLend is taking steps to rectify the situation and reinforce DeFi security . Understanding the zkLend Exploit and its Impact The exploit, which sent ripples through the Starknet ecosystem and the broader DeFi community, highlighted the ever-present risks in the nascent world of decentralized finance. While details of the exact vulnerability exploited are still being analyzed, the outcome was clear: a substantial amount of funds was compromised. For users of zkLend, this meant potential losses and a significant disruption to their DeFi activities. The immediate aftermath of such an exploit is always critical, testing the resilience and responsiveness of the affected protocol. zkLend’s prompt action in addressing the issue and establishing a recovery portal signals a proactive approach to user protection and trust restoration. To put the incident into perspective, consider these key points: Magnitude of Loss: Approximately $9.5 million was lost, a considerable sum even within the high-stakes environment of DeFi. Platform Affected: zkLend, a lending protocol on Starknet, known for its focus on scalability and lower gas fees. User Impact: Users who had deposited or were lending assets on zkLend were directly affected by the exploit. Community Reaction: The DeFi community closely watched zkLend’s response, as such incidents serve as crucial learning moments for the entire ecosystem. The Beacon of Hope: zkLend’s Recovery Portal In the face of adversity, zkLend’s announcement of a recovery portal acts as a beacon of hope for affected users. This portal is not just a symbolic gesture; it’s a concrete mechanism for users to begin the process of reclaiming their lost funds. But how does this recovery portal actually work, and what does it mean for users? Here’s a breakdown of what we know about the zkLend recovery initiative: Purpose-Built System: The portal is specifically designed to handle claims related to the recent exploit. This focused approach is crucial for efficient processing and management of user requests. User-Centric Design: zkLend has emphasized user-friendliness in the portal’s design, aiming to make the recovery process as smooth and transparent as possible for those affected. Transparency and Communication: zkLend’s communication via X (formerly Twitter) and the launch of the portal itself demonstrate a commitment to transparency, which is vital in regaining user trust after a security incident. Step-by-Step Guidance: The portal likely provides clear instructions and steps for users to submit their claims, ensuring even less technically savvy users can navigate the process. While the specifics of the portal’s operation will unfold as users begin to engage with it, the very existence of this crypto refund mechanism is a significant positive development. It underscores zkLend’s responsibility towards its community and sets a precedent for how DeFi protocols should respond to security breaches. Why DeFi Security Remains Paramount The zkLend exploit is a stark reminder of why DeFi security is not just a buzzword but a foundational necessity for the sustainable growth of decentralized finance. The promise of DeFi – open access, transparency, and user control – is intrinsically linked to the security and robustness of these platforms. When exploits occur, they not only cause financial harm but also erode trust in the entire DeFi ecosystem. Let’s consider why security is so critical in the DeFi landscape: Aspect Importance for DeFi Security Trust and Adoption Users need to trust that their funds are safe. Frequent exploits can deter mainstream adoption and limit the potential of DeFi. Financial Risk Mitigation DeFi protocols handle substantial amounts of user funds. Robust security measures are essential to minimize financial risks and prevent devastating losses. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities DeFi relies heavily on smart contracts, which, if not rigorously audited and tested, can contain vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit. Ecosystem Stability The interconnected nature of DeFi means that an exploit on one protocol can have cascading effects on others. Strong security contributes to the overall stability of the DeFi ecosystem. Regulatory Scrutiny Increasing regulatory attention on DeFi necessitates a proactive approach to security to demonstrate responsible platform operation and user protection. Incidents like the zkLend exploit, while unfortunate, serve as crucial learning opportunities for the DeFi space. They highlight the need for continuous improvement in security practices, smart contract auditing, and incident response protocols. Lessons Learned and Moving Forward: Strengthening Starknet and Beyond The zkLend incident, while specific to this protocol on Starknet, offers valuable lessons for the entire DeFi ecosystem, including the Starknet network itself. What actionable insights can we glean from this situation to bolster Starknet security and DeFi in general? Here are key takeaways and steps for improvement: Enhanced Smart Contract Audits: Protocols should invest in rigorous and frequent smart contract audits from reputable security firms. These audits should go beyond surface-level checks and delve deep into potential vulnerabilities. Proactive Vulnerability Disclosure Programs: Encouraging white-hat hackers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities through bug bounty programs can significantly strengthen security. Incident Response Planning: Having a well-defined incident response plan in place is crucial. zkLend’s swift action in launching a recovery portal is a positive example of incident response. Community Vigilance and Education: The DeFi community, including users, developers, and auditors, must remain vigilant and continuously educate themselves about emerging security threats and best practices. Layer 2 Security Focus: As Layer 2 solutions like Starknet gain prominence, dedicated attention must be given to their specific security considerations and potential attack vectors. For zkLend, the immediate focus is on the successful operation of the recovery portal and ensuring that affected users are appropriately compensated. Looking ahead, it will be critical for zkLend and other DeFi protocols to implement robust security enhancements to prevent similar incidents and foster greater user confidence. Conclusion: A Path to Recovery and a More Secure DeFi Future The $9.5 million exploit on zkLend was undoubtedly a setback, highlighting the inherent risks within the DeFi space. However, zkLend’s decisive action in launching a recovery portal offers a significant silver lining. This initiative not only provides a pathway for users to reclaim their funds but also sends a powerful message about accountability and user protection in DeFi. The incident underscores the critical importance of DeFi security , robust smart contract audits, and proactive incident response.

However, bearish momentum remains strong, keeping most cryptocurrencies near their support levels. The broader market saw significant liquidations as uncertainty persisted. With fears of prolonged declines, analysts warn of potential risks, making it crucial to identify an altcoin to sell before further downturns. 4 Altcoins to Sell Ahead of Trump’s March 7 Crypto Event Two days to Donald Trump’s first Crypto Summit on March 7 2025, industry leaders, CEOs, and government officials prepare for key discussions. Market analysts anticipate volatility, with potential price drops for certain altcoins, if regulatory policies or economic outlooks appear unfavorable during the event. Let’s uncover these four altcoins to offload, including TON, SOL, LEO, and TIA. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin (TON) struggles as market conditions weaken, facing strong resistance and limited support. The price hovers at $3.00, marking a 1.53% daily increase. However, a 15% weekly decline signals a bearish sentiment. TON’s market cap has dropped significantly, slipping from the 11th to the 21st position. Traders consider it an altcoin to offload ahead of Trump’s Crypto Summit on March 7, fearing further declines. Source: TradingView LEO BitMart has confirmed the listing of UNUS SED LEO (LEO), set to launch at 20:00 (ET) on March 5. The exchange will open trading for the LEO/USDT pair. LEO serves as the utility token for Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange managed by iFinex. A unique token burn mechanism ensures that iFinex repurchases LEO monthly. This strategy aims to reduce supply over time. At present, LEO is priced at $9.80, reflecting a 0.36% decline in the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) price has been trading with strong volatility, making it an altcoin to sell ahead of Trump’s crypto summit on March 7. The price has dropped 52.08% from its $294 high, now hovering below $150. An analyst noted that despite rejection, SOL defended the $125 support and is squeezing against the main downtrend resistance. This movement signals potential liquidation as uncertainty builds in the market. Celestia (TIA) Celestia (TIA) is trading at $3.30, reflecting a 15% decline over the past week. The token has been on a consistent downtrend in recent months, with its value significantly lower than its all-time high of $20.91 in February 2024. This decline has placed TIA among the cryptocurrencies facing strong selling pressure. Ahead of the upcoming crypto summit on March 7, analysts highlight TIA as one of the altcoins to offload , citing concerns over potential long-term losses in a weakening market. Conclusion With market conditions still uncertain, traders should assess risks and monitor price movements. Selling weak assets before further losses can be a strategic move. Identifying an altcoin to sell before major events like Trump’s crypto summit may help mitigate potential long-term risks in this volatile market.

South Korean crypto giant Bithumb has just dropped a bombshell, issuing a stark Bithumb warning to its users about potential Ponzi scheme risks associated with Quantvine. This news has sent ripples through the crypto community, raising serious questions about the safety of automated investment platforms and the ever-present threat of crypto ponzi scheme operations. Why is Bithumb Sounding the Alarm on Quantvine? According to an official announcement on Bithumb’s website, the exchange has flagged concerns regarding Quantvine, an automated crypto investment platform. Bithumb’s primary worry centers around the possibility that Quantvine might be operating as an illegal Ponzi scheme. This is a serious allegation that demands immediate attention from anyone involved or considering engaging with Quantvine. Here’s what we know from Bithumb’s official statement: Official Warning: Bithumb has explicitly warned users about potential illegal Ponzi concerns linked to Quantvine. Withdrawal Restrictions: Users attempting to withdraw crypto to addresses linked to Quantvine may face rejection, particularly for registrations under KRW 1 million. This is a significant step taken by Bithumb to protect its users. User Caution Advised: Bithumb strongly advises users to exercise extreme caution when dealing with Quantvine, especially concerning withdrawals and further investments. This isn’t just a minor advisory; it’s a clear red flag from a major South Korean crypto exchange . Bithumb’s proactive stance highlights the ongoing battle against fraudulent schemes in the volatile crypto market. But what exactly makes Quantvine a potential Ponzi risk, and how can you protect yourself? Understanding the Red Flags: Spotting a Crypto Ponzi Scheme Ponzi schemes, in the crypto world or otherwise, operate on a simple yet devastatingly effective premise: paying early investors with money from newer investors. This creates a facade of high returns, enticing more people to invest, until the scheme inevitably collapses when new investments dry up. Here are some tell-tale signs of a potential crypto ponzi scheme , which might be relevant in the Quantvine situation and are crucial for any crypto investor to recognize: Red Flag Description Unrealistically High Returns Promises of guaranteed, exceptionally high returns with little to no risk are a major red flag. Legitimate investments always carry risk. Consistent Returns Regardless of Market Conditions Crypto markets are volatile. A platform claiming consistent profits regardless of market ups and downs is suspicious. Complex or Secretive Strategies Ponzi schemes often use complex jargon or vague explanations about how they generate profits to obfuscate their lack of real investment activities. Pressure to Recruit Others Many Ponzi schemes rely on network marketing or referral programs, incentivizing existing investors to bring in new ones. Withdrawal Difficulties As Bithumb’s warning indicates, difficulties or delays in withdrawals are a critical warning sign that the scheme may be running out of new money to pay investors. While it’s important to note that these are potential red flags and further investigation is always needed, Bithumb’s Bithumb warning about Quantvine strongly suggests that some of these concerns are present. Quantvine: What We Know About the Platform Quantvine markets itself as an automated crypto investment platform, often promising high returns through sophisticated trading algorithms or strategies. While automated trading can be legitimate, it also presents an avenue for fraudulent schemes to attract unsuspecting investors. Key aspects to consider regarding Quantvine, in light of Bithumb’s warning: Lack of Transparency: Is Quantvine transparent about its trading strategies and how it generates returns? Vague descriptions should raise concerns. Regulatory Compliance: Is Quantvine registered and compliant with relevant financial regulations in its operating jurisdiction? Lack of regulatory oversight is a significant risk factor. Independent Reviews: Are there credible, independent reviews or audits of Quantvine’s operations and performance? Be wary of testimonials that seem too good to be true or are affiliated with the platform. Bithumb’s Action: The fact that a reputable South Korean crypto exchange like Bithumb has issued a public warning is in itself a major point of concern and should not be taken lightly. Navigating Crypto Investment Risks: Actionable Insights Bithumb’s Bithumb warning serves as a crucial reminder of the inherent crypto investment risks in the digital asset space. Here are some actionable steps you can take to protect yourself from potential Ponzi schemes and other crypto scams: Due Diligence is Paramount: Before investing in any crypto platform, especially those promising automated returns, conduct thorough research. Investigate the platform’s team, technology, and regulatory compliance. Question Unrealistic Promises: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be skeptical of platforms guaranteeing high, consistent returns. Diversify Your Investments: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio across different assets and platforms to mitigate risk. Start Small: If you’re considering a new platform, start with a small investment to test withdrawals and platform functionality before committing larger sums. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest news and warnings from reputable sources like crypto exchanges and regulatory bodies. Bithumb’s warning is a prime example of such crucial information. Seek Independent Financial Advice: Consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor before making significant crypto investments. Conclusion: Heeding the Warning and Protecting Your Crypto Bithumb’s explicit warning about Quantvine and potential crypto ponzi scheme risks is a critical development for the crypto community. It underscores the importance of vigilance, due diligence, and a healthy dose of skepticism when navigating the world of crypto investments. While automated investment platforms can offer convenience, they also carry inherent risks, particularly the danger of falling prey to fraudulent schemes. The situation with Quantvine serves as a potent reminder: protect your crypto assets by staying informed, being cautious, and always prioritizing security over the allure of quick and easy profits. Don’t let the promise of high returns blind you to the very real crypto investment risks . Heed the Bithumb warning and invest wisely.

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a wild ride this week, and leading Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital is sounding the alarm. Volatility is surging, creating both opportunities and anxieties in the digital asset space. What’s behind this sudden market turbulence, and what can we expect as the highly anticipated White House Crypto Summit approaches? Let’s dive into the key factors driving this crypto volatility and what it means for your portfolio. Why is Crypto Volatility Surging? According to QCP Capital’s recent Telegram update, a confluence of global events is fueling the current crypto volatility . It’s not just one factor, but a combination of macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions creating a perfect storm in the crypto market. Let’s break down the key drivers: Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan: Rumors and speculation surrounding a potential crypto reserve plan initiated by former President Trump are injecting uncertainty into the market. While details remain scarce, the mere suggestion of such a plan is enough to trigger market fluctuations as investors try to anticipate its potential impact. Escalating U.S. Tariffs: The U.S. is ramping up trade tensions with key partners, increasing tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. These escalating tariffs are creating ripples of unease throughout global markets, and crypto is not immune. Trade wars often lead to economic uncertainty, which in turn can drive investors towards or away from risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Retaliatory Measures: As expected, these tariff hikes are met with retaliatory measures from the affected countries. This tit-for-tat trade war intensifies macroeconomic uncertainty and further fuels market volatility across asset classes, including crypto. Hints of Tariff Rollback & Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Adding another layer of complexity, the U.S. Commerce Secretary has hinted at a possible partial rollback of tariffs. While seemingly positive, this mixed messaging contributes to—you guessed it—more macroeconomic uncertainty. The market hates uncertainty, and this flip-flopping on trade policy is exacerbating the crypto volatility we’re currently witnessing. Crypto-Equities Link: It’s increasingly clear that the crypto market is becoming more closely correlated with traditional equities. When macroeconomic uncertainty rises and equity markets become volatile, crypto markets tend to follow suit. This interconnectedness means that global economic jitters directly translate into fluctuations in the crypto space. In essence, the current crypto volatility is a symptom of broader global economic and political tensions. It’s a reminder that the crypto market, while operating in its own unique sphere, is still deeply intertwined with traditional financial systems and global events. White House Crypto Summit: Will it Calm the Waters? Amidst this swirling crypto volatility , the first-ever White House Crypto Summit is scheduled for March 7th. This summit is generating considerable buzz and anticipation within the crypto community. Will it be a turning point for crypto regulation and adoption in the U.S., or just another talking shop? QCP Capital highlights a crucial point: market participants are approaching the summit with caution. Here’s why skepticism is prevailing, despite the potential significance of a White House summit dedicated to crypto: Lack of Concrete Action: Summits are often high on rhetoric but low on tangible outcomes. Unless the White House Crypto Summit results in concrete executive orders, specific funding plans, or clear pathways for congressional support, the market is unlikely to react with bullish enthusiasm. Words alone are not enough to quell the current crypto volatility or inspire lasting confidence. Market Sentiment: After periods of heightened volatility and uncertainty, market participants tend to become more risk-averse. They are looking for solid evidence of positive change, not just promises. The summit needs to deliver more than just optimistic statements to shift the prevailing cautious sentiment. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S. remains murky and fragmented. Investors are seeking clarity and consistency in regulation. If the summit can pave the way for a more unified and supportive regulatory framework, it could significantly reduce long-term crypto volatility and attract institutional investment. In short, while the White House Crypto Summit is a welcome development, the crypto market is in a “show-me-the-money” mood. Meaningful action, not just discussion, is needed to truly impact market sentiment and curb the ongoing crypto volatility . Tariffs Impact: How Trade Tensions Fuel Crypto Market Jitters The escalating U.S. tariffs are more than just economic headlines; they are directly contributing to the current crypto markets ‘ unease. But how exactly do tariffs translate into volatility in the digital asset realm? Here’s a breakdown of the connection: Tariff Escalation Impact on Global Economy Consequences for Crypto Markets Increased tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China Higher costs for businesses and consumers Disruptions to supply chains Reduced global trade volume Potential for slower economic growth Increased risk aversion among investors Flight to safety assets (potentially away from crypto in the short term) Correlation between crypto and traditional risk assets strengthens Crypto markets become more susceptible to macroeconomic news and sentiment Essentially, tariffs create economic uncertainty. This uncertainty spills over into financial markets, causing investors to become more cautious and reactive. Since crypto markets are still considered relatively high-risk assets, they often experience amplified volatility during periods of economic unease driven by factors like tariff disputes. Navigating Economic Uncertainty in Crypto: Strategies for Investors In times of economic uncertainty , like the one we’re currently experiencing, navigating the crypto market requires a strategic and informed approach. Economic uncertainty creates both challenges and opportunities. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one crypto basket. Diversify your portfolio across different types of cryptocurrencies and even consider allocating a portion to more traditional assets to mitigate risk during volatile periods. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider using dollar-cost averaging. Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This strategy can help smooth out the impact of crypto volatility over time. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic news, geopolitical developments, and regulatory updates. Understanding the factors driving market volatility is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysis from firms like QCP Capital. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Economic uncertainty can lead to unexpected market downturns. Implement risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders and carefully assessing your risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto markets are inherently volatile, but they also have significant long-term growth potential. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the projects you invest in and avoid getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of extreme crypto volatility , consider temporarily parking some of your portfolio in stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar and can offer a safe haven during market turbulence. Conclusion: Riding the Crypto Volatility Wave The current surge in crypto volatility , driven by a complex interplay of factors from Trump’s crypto plans to escalating tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty, presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. The upcoming White House Crypto Summit is a significant event, but its impact will depend on concrete actions rather than just pronouncements. Navigating this period requires a cautious yet informed approach, emphasizing diversification, risk management, and a long-term perspective. While the market may be jittery now, understanding the drivers of crypto volatility and adopting strategic investment practices can help you weather the storm and potentially capitalize on future opportunities in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

According to investment bank TD Cowen, the absence suggests that cryptocurrencies are not a major focus for Trump. TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, noted in a note published today that this exclusion is significant. “If it was a personal priority, then it would have been in the conversation,” Seiberg wrote, emphasizing that Trump’s decision to leave out crypto was more than just an oversight. The omission is particularly notable given that Trump has been referring to cryptocurrencies in speeches and social media posts in the days leading up to his speech. Seiberg sees this silence as “more significant” than the lack of discussion on other issues like housing and banking, given that Trump has a known stance on crypto policy. Related News: Bitcoin's Long-Awaited Bottom Signal May Have Arrived! ""The Price Had Previously Increased by 200 Percent!"" Seiberg pointed to potential political motivations behind Trump’s decision, noting that Republicans in Congress are currently trying to secure Democratic support for stablecoin legislation. Any direct involvement by Trump could complicate those negotiations, making it strategically beneficial for him to remain silent on the issue. Another explanation, however, is that Trump does not see crypto as a pressing issue within his broader political agenda. “When Trump appears before crypto investors, he mentions crypto. Yet we continue to believe that this is not a personal priority,” Seiberg said. Overall, Seiberg described Trump's speech as “long on showmanship and short on substance, even for a Donald Trump speech.” *This is not investment advice.

It marked the altcoin’s highest level since early February, when its price dropped below $400. Notably, BCH price rose amid a breakout from a falling wedge pattern, in place as the altcoin continued its multi-year accumulation phase. Data from IntoTheBlock shows the number of BCH holders in profit has risen slightly to 73%, with this coming amid a surge in whale transactions. BCH outpaces top coins Market data at the time of writing showed Bitcoin Cash price hovered at $389, up nearly 30% and outpacing all the top 10 coins. These include Bitcoin, which changed hands 6.5% up, Ethereum, which was up 7.2% and XRP, 3.9%. With daily trading volume increasing by more than 83% to over $942 million and a market cap of $7.65 billion, Bitcoin Cash also led as the best-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100 by market cap in the last 24 hours. Its intraday gains put BCH above Jito, Ondo Finance and Chainlink, all of which were up between 14% and 22%.

The veteran finance executive Simon McWilliams will now serve as CFO for Tether, which issues the dollar-pegged USDT , the top stablecoin by market cap. McWilliams will lead the stablecoin issuer toward a full audit and “spearhead Tether’s further commitment to transparency and regulatory readiness,” according to a press release from the firm. Tether didn’t provide a timeline for the audit. The firm already releases quarterly attestation reports with the accounting giant BDO, but it says a full audit will “ensure greater financial integrity and verification of reserves.” The stablecoin issuer has dealt with regulatory issues recently, including failing to gain compliance with the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which has led to crypto exchanges delisting USDT in Europe. MiCA establishes rules covering the supervision, consumer protection and environmental safeguards of crypto assets. The regulatory framework includes measures that aim to reduce financial crimes, including market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing. It also places stablecoin issuers under the European Banking Authority and requires them to hold sufficient liquid reserves.

In an ongoing discussion, pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan has hinted that a resolution could come to an end as early as March. XRP Lawsuit Coming To An End in March? Legal expert Jeremy Hogan has dropped a major hint about a possible early resolution in the XRP lawsuit, sparking excitement among investors. Meanwhile, in an ongoing discussion, a community member asked Hogan whether the SEC’s recent trend of dropping lawsuits could lead to a quick resolution for Ripple in March, with the injunction issue handled later. Yes, but I'd wait until eveything is hashed out before dismissing the appeals. This all has to be done very carefully. — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) March 4, 2025 Hogan responded that an early dismissal is possible but warned that all legal matters must be fully settled before celebrating. Adding to the buzz, Hogan also revealed that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse might attend the White House Crypto Summit. While some questioned the accuracy of this claim, Hogan stood firm, fueling further speculation about a potential game changing moment for Ripple. What’s Next for Ripple Lawsuits The SEC filed its opening appeal on January 15, 2025, and Ripple has until April 16 to respond. Legal experts, including Hogan, have pointed to the injunction on XRP sales as a key reason why the case is still ongoing.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has dropped a bombshell, hinting at a seismic shift in the nation’s crypto policy under President Donald Trump. According to The Pavlovic Today, the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7th is set to be the stage for a monumental announcement that could redefine America’s stance on digital currencies. Is a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve on the Horizon? Lutnick’s revelation suggests that President Trump is not just dipping his toes into the crypto waters; he’s planning a full dive! The centerpiece of this anticipated policy shift is the establishment of a national Bitcoin strategic reserve . Imagine the U.S., a global economic powerhouse, holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset, much like gold or oil. This move could send shockwaves through the global financial system and legitimize Bitcoin on an unprecedented scale. But what does this really mean? Validation of Bitcoin: A strategic reserve would signal the U.S. government’s recognition of Bitcoin as a significant digital asset, potentially boosting its credibility and mainstream adoption. Geopolitical Implications: Holding Bitcoin could give the U.S. a strategic advantage in the evolving digital economy, influencing global crypto markets and potentially challenging the dominance of traditional financial systems. Market Impact: The demand surge from a national reserve could dramatically impact Bitcoin’s price, potentially triggering a bull run and attracting further institutional investment. However, questions remain. How large would this reserve be? How would it be managed? And what are the potential risks and benefits of such a bold move? Decoding Trump’s Vision for Crypto Regulation Beyond the Bitcoin strategic reserve , Lutnick indicated that President Trump will also lay out his broader vision for crypto regulation . This is crucial for the industry, which has long grappled with regulatory uncertainty. A clear and comprehensive regulatory framework could either stifle innovation or provide a fertile ground for growth. What can we expect from Trump’s approach? According to Lutnick, while Trump views cryptocurrencies positively, there’s a distinction in his approach. Bitcoin seems to be in favor, but altcoins might face a different regulatory landscape. This bifurcation could lead to: Stricter Scrutiny for Altcoins: Altcoins, which encompass thousands of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, might face stricter regulations concerning their issuance, trading, and use. This could be due to concerns about investor protection, market manipulation, and the higher risk profile often associated with newer or less established cryptocurrencies. Favorable Environment for Bitcoin: Bitcoin, as the oldest and most established cryptocurrency, could be positioned as a more regulated and ‘safer’ digital asset under Trump’s policy. This could attract institutional investors who prefer the relative stability and established track record of Bitcoin. Innovation and Compliance Balance: The challenge will be to create regulations that are robust enough to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, yet flexible enough to allow for continued innovation and growth in the crypto space. The details of this regulatory framework are eagerly awaited. Will it be innovation-friendly, or will it impose constraints that could push crypto activity overseas? The White House Crypto Summit: A Pivotal Moment The upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7th is shaping up to be a landmark event. It’s not just another industry gathering; it’s a potential turning point for cryptocurrency in the United States and globally. What makes this summit so significant? This summit is significant because it: Elevates Crypto to a National Level: Hosting a summit at the White House signifies that the U.S. government is taking cryptocurrency seriously as a matter of national economic and strategic importance. Signals Policy Direction: The summit is expected to provide clear signals about the future direction of U.S. crypto policy , influencing investment decisions, business strategies, and technological developments in the sector. Brings Key Stakeholders Together: It will likely convene key figures from the crypto industry, government agencies, and traditional finance, fostering dialogue and collaboration on the future of digital assets. The summit’s outcome could set the tone for global crypto regulation and influence how other nations approach digital currencies. The world will be watching closely. Navigating the Altcoin Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges The potential differentiation in regulation between Bitcoin and altcoins presents both opportunities and challenges for investors and developers. What does this mean for the diverse world of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin? Let’s break down the potential implications for altcoins: Aspect Potential Opportunities for Altcoins Potential Challenges for Altcoins Regulation Clearer regulatory paths for compliant projects; potential for specific niches to thrive under tailored regulations. Increased compliance costs; potential for some altcoins to be deemed non-compliant and face restrictions; market uncertainty. Investment Sophisticated investors might seek out compliant and regulated altcoins; focus on projects with strong fundamentals and real-world use cases. Reduced retail investor interest in altcoins perceived as riskier; market volatility due to regulatory news; funding challenges for non-compliant projects. Innovation Incentive for altcoin projects to innovate within regulatory frameworks; development of compliance-focused technologies and protocols. Potential stifling of innovation if regulations are too restrictive; brain drain to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions; slower pace of development for some projects. For those invested in or developing altcoins, the key takeaway is to closely monitor the evolving regulatory landscape and prioritize compliance and transparency. Projects with strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and a proactive approach to regulation are likely to be best positioned to navigate this new era. Actionable Insights: Preparing for the Crypto Policy Shift So, what should you do to prepare for this potential crypto policy shift? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources and crypto analysts for real-time updates on the White House Crypto Summit and related policy announcements. Diversify Wisely: Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio, understanding the potential regulatory differences between Bitcoin and altcoins. Due Diligence is Key: For altcoin investments, conduct thorough research into the project’s fundamentals, team, technology, and compliance efforts. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in discussions and forums about crypto regulation to stay ahead of the curve and contribute to the shaping of responsible policies. Prepare for Volatility: Major policy announcements can trigger market volatility. Be prepared for potential price swings and manage your risk accordingly. The crypto world is on the cusp of potentially transformative changes. President Trump’s anticipated policy shift could usher in a new era of regulation, adoption, and strategic importance for digital currencies. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor, a curious observer, or a developer in the space, now is the time to pay close attention and prepare for the ripples that this announcement could send across the global landscape.

The former Binance CEO made the comments in response to a post that highlighted some of the key people who had a say in making the crypto space grow. Zhao attributed Buterin to the wide scale of the blockchain industry. He relates to various things that the Ethereum co-founder helped develop, including the invention of smart contracts by Ethereum’s inception. Smart contracts are the lifeblood of the development of decentralized applications and platforms. Buterin drives crypto growth and revolutionizes digital ownership Buterin is also credited with devising another major standard, the ERC-20 token standard, which has enabled the launch of thousands of altcoins on the Ethereum network. The widespread and standardized use began a rapid cycle of growth for the crypto market and a framework for many blockchain projects. Buterin also played a key role in changing the way we think about digital ownership with the emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), defining the ERC-721 standard. NFTs have grown into a major asset class in industries ranging from art and entertainment to gaming and digital identity. In his remarks, Zhao downplayed his own impact on the industry, humorously referring to himself as “a pleb still learning about blockchain.” Despite his modesty, CZ has been a key player in the crypto ecosystem, particularly through his leadership at Binance, which grew into one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. CZ recalls meeting Buterin and questioning Ethereum’s potential Zhao also looked back at his first encounters with Buterin. He said he’d first met the Ethereum co-founder at a Bitcoin conference in 2013, a year before the launch of Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014. At that time, Zhao had not been convinced Ethereum’s language was Turing complete, and he asked Buterin whether it was “too big of a bite to chew.” Buterin reassured Zhao that the vision was attainable. While CZ confessed that he wished he had bought more Ethereum during its ICO, he theorized that missing out may have motivated him to build Binance and the Binance Coin (BNB) ecosystem. Zhao’s nod to Buterin highlights the Ethereum co-creator’s impact on the advancement of blockchain. With the crypto space ever-evolving, influencers like Buterin and Zhao help shape this systemic industry’s trajectory through their contributions and innovations. CZ urges traders to cut investments amid crypto crash CZ recently gained significant attention amid a crypto market crash with his investment tip. He posted on X, addressing the current market dip whilst urging traders to reduce investment portfolios if stressed. Notably, cryptocurrency prices were facing immense heat, as Bitcoin (BTC) hit a $78K low, while altcoins mimicked an even harder price fall. As per CZ’s X post last week, he advised traders and investors who were stressed amid the current dip to reduce their ‘investment size, given one considers crypto as an investment.’ The Binance founder stated, “Dips are a part of free markets,” further rationalizing the current market crash. CZ recently said he will not build any new crypto projects. The decision comes as a significant shift for the influential figure who once defied skeptics and built Binance into the world’s leading crypto exchange. He recently tweeted about the importance of innovation, telling developers to “keep building.” But when asked if he was starting a new exchange or project, he noted , “I won’t start a new project. I will help other founders.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Whale Dumps $40 Million Worth UNI appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, March 5, 2025, Uniswap (UNI) has registered an 8% price gain. However, it appears bearish and is poised for a decline, potentially due to a crypto whale dumping UNI tokens. Whale Dump $40.60 Million Worth of UNI Tokens Today, blockchain-based transaction tracker Lookonchain posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a prominent crypto whale, Galaxy Digital, deposited 600K UNI tokens worth $4.37 million onto Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Galaxy Digital deposited another 600K $UNI ($4.37M) to #Binance and #OKX 30 minutes ago.

Current Price Momentum With all this, the asset is trading near $7.37, gaining 8% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 35%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. This decline was potentially caused by the sell-off and ongoing price fluctuations. Uniswap (UNI) Price Action and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, UNI appears bearish as it is already trading below the crucial support level of $8. With recent price fluctuations, it has retested this level and seems to be consolidating. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if UNI fails to climb above the $8 level, it could drop by 25% to reach $5.50 in the coming days.

Fireblocks’ secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology plays a crucial role in facilitating this solution.

For Sygnum, this collaboration reinforces its role as a trusted banking partner in the digital asset industry. The Swiss-regulated crypto bank continues to expand its range of institutional services, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. Fireblocks, a leading provider of digital asset security solutions, benefits from further adoption of its “Off Exchange” service.

41197859,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137127,1741197900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Insightful Analysis: Why Bitcoin Market Overreaction to Trump’s Crypto Reserve Plan is Bullish,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-market-trump-crypto-plan/,"The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, often swinging wildly on news and speculation. Recently, Donald Trump’s proposal for a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve sent ripples through the crypto sphere. Initially, we saw prices surge, only to witness those gains evaporate amidst tariff announcements and debates over which assets might be included in this reserve. But is the market’s reaction justified? Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan thinks not. Let’s dive into why he believes we might be overthinking things, and why this plan could actually be a bullish signal for Bitcoin in the long run. Decoding the Market Reaction to the Crypto Reserve Plan When news of Trump’s U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve plan first broke, the crypto market responded with typical enthusiasm. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced an immediate price jump. This initial surge reflected investor optimism about the potential for mainstream adoption and government validation of digital assets. However, this euphoria was short-lived. Concerns quickly arose, particularly regarding: Tariff Announcements: Simultaneous announcements of new tariffs overshadowed the positive crypto news, injecting broader market uncertainty and risk aversion. Asset Inclusion Debates: Speculation about the inclusion of assets beyond Bitcoin, such as Cardano, sparked debate. Some investors worried that diluting the reserve with less established cryptocurrencies could weaken its strategic focus. Market Overthinking: According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, the market’s subsequent pullback represents an overreaction. He suggests investors are getting lost in the immediate noise and missing the bigger picture. Hougan’s perspective, as reported by The Block, offers a valuable counterpoint to the prevailing market sentiment. He argues that the core concept of a crypto reserve, especially one primarily focused on Bitcoin , is inherently positive for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Why Bitwise CIO Sees Long-Term Bullishness in Trump’s Crypto Plan Matt Hougan’s bullish outlook on the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve plan hinges on several key factors. He emphasizes that regardless of the immediate market fluctuations, the fundamental recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic asset by a major global power is a game-changer. Here’s a breakdown of his reasoning: Validation of Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset: The very notion of a national crypto reserve signifies a profound shift in perception. It moves Bitcoin away from the fringes of finance and firmly into the realm of strategic national importance, similar to commodities like oil or gold. Anticipated Focus on Bitcoin: Hougan believes that while the initial proposal might be broad, the practical implementation of a crypto reserve is likely to gravitate towards Bitcoin. Its established market dominance, liquidity, and decentralization make it the most logical choice for a long-term, secure reserve asset. Global Competition and Bitcoin Accumulation: He anticipates a global race among nations to accumulate Bitcoin, driven by the U.S.’s initiative. This competitive accumulation could significantly drive up demand and price for Bitcoin over time. Long-Term Holding Strategy: Drawing parallels to U.S. gold reserves, Hougan expects that any Bitcoin acquired for a strategic reserve would be held for the long haul. This reduces the circulating supply and further reinforces Bitcoin’s value proposition as a store of value. Is a Bitcoin-Centric Reserve More Bullish? Hougan’s argument for a Bitcoin-focused reserve is compelling. While diversification might seem prudent in some investment strategies, a strategic reserve operates under different principles. Here’s why concentrating on Bitcoin could amplify the bullish impact: Factor Bitcoin-Centric Reserve Diversified Crypto Reserve Market Impact Stronger, more direct positive impact on Bitcoin price due to concentrated demand. Potentially diluted impact across multiple assets, less pronounced effect on Bitcoin. Security & Decentralization Leverages Bitcoin’s robust security and decentralized nature, ideal for long-term storage. May introduce complexities and vulnerabilities associated with less mature or centralized assets. Clarity of Purpose Clear signal of strategic intent focused on the leading cryptocurrency. Potentially muddies the message, raising questions about the rationale for including less established assets. Challenges and Uncertainties Ahead While Hougan’s perspective is optimistic, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve plan: Evolving Plan: The specifics of the reserve plan are still fluid. The final composition, size, and implementation strategy could differ significantly from the initial announcement. Political Opposition: Any government initiative, especially one involving cryptocurrencies, is likely to face political scrutiny and potential opposition. Shifting political landscapes could impact the plan’s trajectory. Regulatory Hurdles: Establishing and managing a crypto reserve would involve navigating complex regulatory frameworks, which could introduce delays and modifications. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what does this mean for crypto investors? Here are some actionable insights based on Hougan’s analysis: Don’t Overreact to Short-Term Volatility: The market’s initial reaction and subsequent pullback might be noise. Focus on the long-term implications of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. Consider Bitcoin’s Strategic Importance: Recognize that the plan, even in its nascent stages, underscores Bitcoin’s growing significance as a strategic asset on a global scale. Monitor Developments Closely: Stay informed about the evolution of the reserve plan, paying attention to details about asset allocation and implementation strategies. Think Long-Term: Hougan’s bullish thesis is rooted in a long-term perspective. Consider the potential for increased demand and reduced supply of Bitcoin if nations begin accumulating it for strategic reserves. Conclusion: A Sensational Shift for Bitcoin? Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s analysis offers a compelling argument that the market may be missing the forest for the trees when it comes to Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve plan. While short-term market jitters are understandable, the underlying message – the recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic asset – could be profoundly positive for the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, in the years to come. The journey of this plan is just beginning, and there will undoubtedly be twists and turns. However, the potential for a global race to accumulate Bitcoin, driven by national strategic interests, paints a fascinating and potentially very bullish picture for the future of cryptocurrency’s leading asset.

A recent report from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting a potentially urgent situation. If just a fraction of U.S. millionaires decide they want to own a single Bitcoin, the available supply could vanish faster than you can say ‘digital gold’. Let’s dive into this critical warning and explore what it means for the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. The Looming Bitcoin Supply Crunch: What BlackRock is Saying BlackRock’s analysis, initially highlighted by Cointelegraph on X, paints a stark picture. With Bitcoin’s inherently limited supply of 21 million coins, the math is quite simple, and frankly, a bit alarming . Imagine this scenario: There are millions of millionaires in the United States alone. Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins. If each U.S. millionaire decided they wanted just one Bitcoin… …there simply wouldn’t be enough Bitcoin to go around. This isn’t just hypothetical; it’s a realistic scenario that underscores the fundamental principle of Bitcoin scarcity . BlackRock, with its finger on the pulse of global investment trends, is essentially waving a red flag, alerting investors to the potential for a significant supply-side squeeze on Bitcoin. Why is Bitcoin Demand from Millionaires a Key Factor? Why focus specifically on millionaires? It boils down to purchasing power and investment trends. Millionaires represent a significant segment of the investor population with substantial capital to deploy. Their investment decisions can have a considerable impact on market dynamics. Here’s why millionaire Bitcoin demand is so crucial: Significant Capital Allocation: Millionaires have the financial means to invest substantial amounts in assets like Bitcoin without significantly impacting their overall wealth. Growing Institutional Interest: Millionaires often mirror institutional investment trends. As institutions increasingly explore and adopt Bitcoin, wealthy individuals are likely to follow suit. Desire for Portfolio Diversification: In an era of economic uncertainty, millionaires are constantly seeking ways to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional assets. Bitcoin, with its uncorrelated nature to traditional markets, becomes an attractive option. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): As Bitcoin’s price potentially appreciates due to increased demand and limited supply, the fear of missing out on potential gains could drive more millionaires to acquire Bitcoin. This confluence of factors suggests that Bitcoin demand from high-net-worth individuals could surge, further exacerbating the supply crunch. Understanding Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply: The Cornerstone of Scarcity To fully grasp the implications of BlackRock’s warning, it’s essential to understand the fundamental characteristic of Bitcoin: its fixed supply. Unlike fiat currencies, which central banks can print at will (potentially leading to inflation), Bitcoin’s protocol dictates a maximum supply of 21 million coins. This pre-programmed Bitcoin supply limit is a core tenet of its value proposition, often likened to digital gold. Here’s a breakdown of why this fixed supply is so significant: Feature Bitcoin Fiat Currencies (e.g., USD, EUR) Supply Fixed at 21 million Unlimited (Central banks can print more) Scarcity Inherently scarce Potentially inflationary (supply can increase) Value Proposition Store of value, hedge against inflation Medium of exchange, subject to inflationary pressures This inherent scarcity is a primary driver behind Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. As demand increases and supply remains fixed, basic economic principles suggest that the price should, theoretically, rise. BlackRock’s warning simply underscores this fundamental economic principle in the context of potential massive Bitcoin demand . The Potential Benefits of Bitcoin Scarcity While a supply crunch might sound concerning, especially if you’re trying to buy Bitcoin, it actually highlights several potential benefits of Bitcoin scarcity for long-term holders and the broader ecosystem: Price Appreciation: As demand outstrips supply, the most direct and noticeable benefit is potential price appreciation. Limited supply coupled with increasing demand is a classic recipe for price increases. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s scarcity reinforces its narrative as a hedge against inflation. In a world where fiat currencies are subject to inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a potential refuge for capital. Increased Investor Confidence: The predictable and transparent nature of Bitcoin’s supply schedule can instill greater confidence among investors. Knowing there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins removes a layer of uncertainty associated with inflationary assets. Long-Term Value Storage: Scarcity strengthens Bitcoin’s case as a long-term store of value. Unlike assets that can be diluted through increased supply, Bitcoin’s fixed supply supports its potential to maintain or increase its purchasing power over time. However, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges as well. Challenges Arising from Bitcoin Supply Constraints While Bitcoin scarcity offers potential benefits, it also presents certain challenges that need to be considered: Price Volatility: Extreme scarcity can exacerbate price volatility. Rapid increases in demand in a supply-constrained market can lead to sharp price spikes, followed by potential corrections. Accessibility Concerns: As Bitcoin becomes scarcer and potentially more expensive, it could become less accessible to smaller investors, potentially leading to centralization of ownership among wealthier individuals and institutions. Transaction Fees: During periods of high demand and network congestion, transaction fees on the Bitcoin network can increase significantly. This could make smaller transactions less economically viable. Potential for Market Manipulation: In a highly scarce market, there’s a theoretical increased risk of market manipulation, although Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and transparency mitigate this to some extent. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Bitcoin Supply Squeeze So, what does BlackRock’s warning and the potential Bitcoin supply crunch mean for you? Here are some actionable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative is fundamentally a long-term story. Focus on the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin as a scarce digital asset rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification Strategy: Consider Bitcoin as part of a diversified investment portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if it’s digital gold. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Employ a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate the risks of price volatility. Regularly invest a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin over time, regardless of the current price. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in the cryptocurrency space, including institutional adoption trends, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Secure Your Holdings: If you invest in Bitcoin, prioritize security. Use hardware wallets and follow best practices for securing your private keys to protect your investment. Conclusion: The Scarcity Story is Just Beginning BlackRock’s warning about a potential Bitcoin supply crunch if millionaires flock to BTC is not just a fleeting headline; it’s a powerful reminder of the fundamental economic forces at play in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, coupled with growing institutional and high-net-worth investor interest, creates a compelling narrative for long-term value appreciation. While challenges like volatility and accessibility exist, the underlying principle of limited supply strengthens Bitcoin’s position as a unique and potentially transformative asset in the digital age. The story of Bitcoin scarcity is far from over; in many ways, it’s just beginning, and understanding this dynamic is crucial for navigating the future of cryptocurrency investments.

Recent Bitcoin Purchases Metaplanet, a Japan-based investment firm, has expanded its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing an additional 497 BTC for $43.9 million. The latest acquisition raises the firm’s total Bitcoin reserves to 2,888 BTC as it continues its aggressive accumulation strategy. Just a couple of days ago the company revealed that it had bought the dip when the price of BTC fell down to $87,000. On March 3, Metaplanet disclosed that it had acquired 156 BTC for $13.4 million at an average price of $85,590 per Bitcoin. Following this, the firm proceeded with another purchase on March 5, securing 497 BTC at an average price of $88,448 per Bitcoin. As a result, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings now amount to $196.3 million, with an average purchase price of $82,100 per BTC. Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation Metaplanet has been consistently increasing its Bitcoin reserves since announcing its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in April 2024. The firm formally designated Bitcoin treasury operations as a core business line in December. With long-term goals in mind, the Tokyo-based company aims to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has also influenced its stock performance, with Metaplanet shares rising 17% in Japan on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Nikkei 225 index recorded a 0.55% gain during the day’s trading session. Potential U.S. Market Expansion Metaplanet’s growing presence has attracted interest from international financial markets. Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet, revealed that the company has been invited by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq to explore potential listings. Gerovich posted on X, ""We are considering the best way to make Metaplanet shares more accessible to investors around the world."" Stock Acquisition Initiative for Bitcoin Expansion In November 2024, Metaplanet unveiled plans to raise 9.5 billion yen (approximately $62 million) through a stock acquisition initiative . The funding, acquired via third-party allotment to EVO Fund, is expected to support the firm’s Bitcoin acquisitions. The issuance, totaling 29,000 units, is set to run from December 16, 2024, to June 16, 2025, pending regulatory approval under Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Metaplanet has emphasized that a substantial portion of the funds will be allocated toward purchasing additional Bitcoin. With it trading at around $87,000, the firm has the potential to acquire several hundred more of the crypto, further strengthening its digital asset holdings amid a weakening yen and Bitcoin’s increasing prominence in global markets.

This surge has propelled certain cryptocurrencies into overbought territory, as their Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) readings indicate. Notably, the RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, typically signals overbought conditions when it exceeds 70. This suggests an asset may be overextended and due for a potential correction. In this context, Finbold has identified the following two digital assets worth avoiding now due to their overbought status. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) is currently among the high-flying digital assets. As of press time, cryptocurrency was trading at $385, gaining 30% on the daily and weekly charts. BCH one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Indeed, investors should proceed cautiously, as the one-hour RSI is 74.16, and the 12-hour RSI is 68.79—both near the threshold typically indicating overbought conditions. It’s worth noting that BCH’s rally aligns with the short-term market recovery following significant capital outflows. This shift came after markets reversed course due to strategic crypto reserve announcements. The latest recovery has emerged amid reports that U.S. President Donald Trump might roll back renewed trade tariffs, which had previously impacted both the cryptocurrency and equities markets. While BCH’s strong performance reflects growing investor interest, these RSI levels increase the likelihood of a price correction in the near future. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin Cash might extend its recent momentum and target the $500 mark. For instance, an analysis by Profit Mind indicated that BCH is currently trading within a descending channel on the daily chart and facing persistent bearish pressure. However, BCH appears to be testing the channel’s lower boundary near a key support zone. If bulls push the price above the descending channel, a breakout could trigger a rally toward the $500 mark. BCH price analysis chart. Source: Profit Mind Jito (JTO) Jito (JTO) is also on an upward trajectory in the short term, a price movement that has elevated the asset into the overbought zone. The asset’s one-hour RSI stands at 71.39, while its 12-hour RSI is at 51.51. Despite JTO’s impressive gains, these metrics caution against entering new positions, as the cryptocurrency could face downward pressure following its rapid ascent. As of press time, JTO was trading at $2.628, surging 25.38% in the last 24 hours. This surge coincides with a rise in trading volume, which has spiked over 30% during the same period. JTO one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Notably, JTO has witnessed increased investor interest, mainly driven by its recent listing on the South Korean exchange Upbit. At the same time, Jito, the largest liquid staking project on Solana, boasts a total value locked (TVL) of $2.23 billion as of press time. Despite overbought RSI levels signaling a potential correction, the next investment decision for Bitcoin Cash and Jito will depend on the broader market trajectory.

The financial markets are bracing for a potential storm, and the latest forecast from Citi is flashing red for the EUR/USD pair. As we navigate the ever-turbulent waters of global economics, understanding the currents driving currency valuations is crucial, especially when these ripples can extend into the crypto sphere. Citi’s recent analysis points towards an escalating risk factor that could significantly impact the forex landscape – and it’s all about tariffs. Let’s dive deep into what this means for your trading strategy and what you need to watch out for in the coming weeks. Decoding the Looming Threat of Tariffs: Why Should Crypto Investors Care? You might be thinking, “Tariffs? That sounds like old news.” But hold on. Citi’s analysts are signaling that the risk associated with tariffs isn’t fading away; it’s actually intensifying as we move into April. For those primarily focused on the crypto market, understanding the impact of traditional financial instruments like EUR/USD and macro-economic factors such as tariffs is surprisingly relevant. Here’s why: Risk Sentiment Connection: Forex markets are often seen as a barometer for global risk sentiment. When traditional markets like forex experience volatility due to events like tariff escalations, it can spill over into the crypto market. Investors often move assets based on perceived risk, and a risk-off sentiment in forex can trigger similar movements in crypto. Economic Interdependence: While crypto operates on a decentralized ethos, it’s not entirely isolated from the traditional financial system. Major currency pairs like EUR/USD reflect the health of significant global economies. Economic shocks stemming from trade disputes and tariffs can impact overall market confidence, influencing investment decisions across all asset classes, including crypto. USD Dominance: A significant portion of crypto trading, particularly Bitcoin, is paired against the US Dollar. The strength or weakness of the USD, often influenced by factors like tariffs and trade balances, can directly impact crypto valuations. If tariffs strengthen the dollar (or weaken its counterparts like the Euro), it can have cascading effects on crypto trading pairs. In essence, what happens in the forex market, especially concerning major pairs like EUR/USD and significant economic drivers like tariffs, can create ripples that are felt even in the seemingly detached world of cryptocurrencies. Citi Analysis: Unpacking the EUR/USD Downside and the Tariff Equation So, what exactly is Citi saying about EUR/USD ? Their analysis suggests a heightened probability of further downside for the pair as we approach April. This isn’t just a generic market fluctuation; it’s tied directly to the increasing risk of tariffs. Let’s break down the key components of their outlook: Tariff Uncertainty as a Drag: Citi believes that the uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential tariff implementations is becoming a significant drag on the Euro. Businesses and investors become hesitant when trade relations are unclear, leading to reduced investment and economic activity in the affected regions, which in turn weakens the currency. EUR Vulnerability: The Eurozone economy, while showing resilience in some areas, is particularly vulnerable to global trade tensions due to its export-oriented nature. Increased tariffs can directly impact European exporters, reducing profitability and economic growth prospects, thus putting downward pressure on the Euro. USD Strength (Potentially): While tariffs can be a double-edged sword, in certain scenarios, they can lead to a perception of US economic protectionism, potentially strengthening the US Dollar, especially against currencies perceived as more vulnerable to trade disruptions like the Euro. April Timeline: Citi specifically points to April as a period where tariff risks could escalate. This might be linked to upcoming policy reviews, trade negotiations, or seasonal trade patterns that historically see increased trade tensions. To put it simply, Citi’s forecast isn’t just about technical analysis of charts; it’s rooted in a fundamental understanding of global trade dynamics and how policy risks, specifically tariffs, can materially impact currency valuations. For traders, this means paying close attention to trade policy announcements and geopolitical developments that could trigger tariff-related volatility. Navigating the Forex Risk Landscape: How to Prepare Your Crypto Strategy The forecast of increased forex risk due to tariffs might sound daunting, but for informed crypto investors, it’s an opportunity to strategize and potentially mitigate risks while identifying potential opportunities. Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Benefit Consideration Diversification Beyond EUR/USD Pairs: Reduce exposure to EUR/USD trading pairs in the short term, especially if your strategy is heavily reliant on them. Mitigates direct impact of EUR/USD volatility driven by tariff concerns. Requires adjusting trading strategies and potentially exploring other currency or crypto pairs. USD-Hedged Crypto Assets: Consider assets that might benefit from USD strength if tariffs lead to a stronger dollar (e.g., certain stablecoins, USD-denominated crypto pairs). Potential to capitalize on USD appreciation in a tariff-driven scenario. Requires careful selection of assets and understanding their correlation with USD strength. Risk Management Tools: Utilize stop-loss orders and other risk management tools to protect your portfolio from sudden market downturns triggered by tariff-related news. Protects capital in volatile market conditions. Requires disciplined risk management and understanding of appropriate stop-loss levels. Stay Informed on Trade News: Actively monitor news related to trade policies, tariff discussions, and geopolitical events that could impact forex markets. Allows for proactive adjustments to your strategy based on emerging information. Requires time and effort to stay updated and filter relevant information from noise. Remember, market forecasts are not guarantees, but they provide valuable insights into potential future scenarios. Citi’s analysis of tariff risks impacting EUR/USD is a crucial piece of information that crypto investors and traders should consider when shaping their strategies. Understanding the Currency Outlook: Beyond EUR/USD While Citi’s report specifically highlights the currency outlook for EUR/USD in the context of tariffs, it’s important to broaden our perspective. The implications of escalating trade tensions and tariffs extend beyond just one currency pair. Here’s a wider view: Global Currency Volatility: Increased tariff risks can lead to broader volatility across global currency markets. Other currencies linked to economies heavily involved in international trade might also experience fluctuations. Emerging Market Currencies: Emerging market currencies can be particularly sensitive to global trade tensions. Tariffs can disrupt supply chains and impact export-dependent economies, leading to currency weakness in these markets. Safe-Haven Assets: In times of increased economic uncertainty driven by tariffs, traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese Yen (JPY) and the Swiss Franc (CHF) might see increased demand. Similarly, within the crypto space, assets perceived as “digital gold” or stores of value might attract more attention. Commodity Currencies: Currencies of countries heavily reliant on commodity exports (like the Australian Dollar (AUD) or Canadian Dollar (CAD)) can be affected by global trade dynamics and tariff-related disruptions in commodity demand. Therefore, while the EUR/USD is a focal point, the underlying message is about a potentially more volatile global currency environment driven by trade policy risks. Crypto investors should consider this broader context when assessing market risks and opportunities. Citi’s Perspective on Market Dynamics: A Summary for Crypto Traders In conclusion, Citi’s analysis serves as an urgent warning for both forex and potentially crypto markets. The core message is that the risk of escalating tariffs is not diminishing but rather intensifying as we move into April. This is particularly relevant for the EUR/USD pair, where Citi anticipates further downside pressure due to these trade-related uncertainties. For crypto investors, the key takeaways are: Forex Market Signals: Pay attention to signals from the forex market, especially major pairs like EUR/USD, as they can reflect broader market risk sentiment that can impact crypto. Tariff Impact Awareness: Understand how tariffs and trade policies can influence currency valuations and overall economic conditions, creating a ripple effect across asset classes. Proactive Risk Management: Incorporate potential forex volatility driven by tariff risks into your crypto trading and investment strategies. Diversification, risk management tools, and staying informed are crucial. The financial markets are interconnected. Understanding the dynamics in one market, like forex, can provide valuable insights and help navigate the complexities of another, like the cryptocurrency market. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade wisely as we navigate these potentially turbulent times.

Not only is the White House contemplating the possibility of creating a national crypto reserve, but the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been ditching its lawsuits against crypto companies and protocols like Kraken and Uniswap. “New policies and regulations will come out and trigger a lot of new ideas for innovation and shake up the crypto industry,” Zheng said. “Though it might take some time to play out — through 2025 and 2026.” Ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) are two of the cryptocurrencies that ZX Squared sees benefitting from a potential new wave of innovation, especially if projects combining artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto take off. The key, Zheng said, is for these smart contract blockchains to keep increasing their throughput in order to remain attractive (in Solana’s case) or take back the initiative (in Ethereum’s case). In the meantime, bitcoin is likely to keep behaving like a risk-on asset, rising and falling in tandem with other such assets as the Trump administration keeps unleashing new economic policies. Macroeconomics will remain firmly at the wheel for the top cryptocurrency, Zheng said, unless the U.S. government pulls the trigger on a potential national crypto reserve — something which could happen at the White House Crypto Summit this Friday. ""A bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President's interested in. He spoke about it all during the campaign trail, and I think you're going to see it executed on Friday,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told The Pavlovic Today. ""So bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently — positively, but differently,"" he added. In any case, even with tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China seemingly coming into effect, Zheng said he didn’t expect bitcoin to go below the $75,000 mark. “In the near term, things are quite choppy,” Zheng said. “But this is a good opportunity for long-term investors who have been waiting to allocate to bitcoin.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Hedge Fund,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 18:09:34

Sounds like science fiction? Think again. A groundbreaking project called GibberLink is making waves online, showcasing a future where AI Agents can converse in their own unique robo-language , bypassing the limitations of human-centric communication. This isn’t just about faster interactions; it’s about a potential paradigm shift in how AI systems operate and interact. What is GibberLink and Why is it Revolutionary for AI Communication? Born out of a weekend hackathon in London, GibberLink is the brainchild of Meta software engineers Boris Starkov and Anton Pidkuiko. This innovative project allows AI Agents to detect when they are communicating with another AI, and then switch to a highly efficient communication protocol known as GGWave . But what makes this so significant? Efficiency Boost: Human language, while nuanced, is computationally expensive for AI to process. GGWave , an open-source library, uses sounds to represent data bits, enabling computers to exchange information much faster. Think of it as a digital handshake on steroids. Cost Reduction: Starkov and Pidkuiko estimate that using GGWave for AI communication could slash computation costs by an order of magnitude. This is huge, especially as AI adoption scales and computational resources become increasingly strained. Future-Proofing AI Interactions: As companies increasingly deploy AI Agents in roles like customer service, the likelihood of AI-to-AI interactions rises. GibberLink provides a glimpse into a future where these interactions are optimized for machine efficiency, not human comprehension. Today I was sent the following cool demo: Two AI agents on a phone call realize they’re both AI and switch to a superior audio signal ggwave pic.twitter.com/TeewgxLEsP — Georgi Gerganov (@ggerganov) February 24, 2025 Decoding Robo-Language: GGWave Explained Imagine the dial-up modem sounds of the 1980s – that distinctive series of beeps and boops. GGWave operates on a similar principle, but far more advanced. It transforms data into a sequence of audio tones. While these tones are unintelligible to the human ear – sounding like robotic gibberish – they are perfectly clear to machines. This robo-language allows for: Feature Human Language GGWave (Robo-Language) Efficiency Less efficient for machine-to-machine communication Highly efficient for machine-to-machine communication Computational Cost High Significantly Lower Human Comprehension Designed for humans Incomprehensible to humans Purpose General communication Optimized for AI-to-AI data exchange Why is GibberLink Going Viral? The internet is buzzing about GibberLink, and for good reason. A simple demo video showcasing two AI Agents switching to GGWave has exploded in popularity, racking up over 15 million views on X and even catching the attention of tech influencer Marques Brownlee. This viral sensation taps into several key themes: Sci-Fi Becoming Reality: The concept of computers speaking their own language has long been a staple of science fiction. GibberLink makes this feel tangibly closer, sparking both excitement and a touch of unease about an AI-driven future. The Intrigue of the Unknown: The “beeps” and “boops” of GGWave are inherently mysterious to us. This auditory glimpse into machine communication piques our curiosity about the hidden world of AI interactions. Practical Implications: Beyond the novelty, GibberLink highlights the growing sophistication of AI and its increasing integration into our daily lives. It raises questions about the future of work, customer service, and the very nature of communication in an AI-powered world. Beyond the Hype: The Real-World Potential of AI Robo-Language While GibberLink is currently a proof-of-concept, its implications are far-reaching. Imagine the possibilities if AI Agents could routinely use robo-language for AI communication : Faster Customer Service: AI-powered customer service agents could resolve issues more quickly and efficiently by communicating directly with other AI systems within a company’s network. Optimized Data Processing: In complex AI systems, internal communication between different AI modules could be streamlined using GGWave or similar protocols, leading to faster processing and improved performance. Resource Savings: The reduced computational cost of robo-language could translate to significant savings in energy consumption and infrastructure requirements for AI deployments. Navigating the Challenges and the Future of GibberLink Despite its potential, GibberLink is still in its early stages. Here are some points to consider: Adoption Hurdles: For GibberLink to be widely useful, it would require broad adoption across different AI platforms and systems. This would necessitate standardization and collaboration within the AI industry. Security Considerations: As with any communication protocol, security is paramount. Ensuring the integrity and privacy of data transmitted via robo-language would be crucial. The Human Element: While robo-language optimizes AI-to-AI communication, human-to-AI interaction will still require natural language processing. Finding the right balance between these communication modes will be key. Currently, GibberLink is open-source and not commercialized. However, Starkov and Pidkuiko are exploring further development in their free time. The project has already sparked a frenzy, with domain squatters and even memecoins emerging. This highlights the powerful public fascination with the idea of AI developing its own unique forms of communication. Conclusion: Is Robo-Language the Next Frontier for AI? GibberLink is more than just a cool hackathon project; it’s a compelling demonstration of the evolving landscape of AI communication . By showcasing the potential of robo-language for efficient machine-to-machine interaction, it opens up exciting possibilities for the future of AI Agents and their role in our increasingly AI-driven world. While still in its nascent stages, GibberLink serves as a powerful reminder that the way AI systems communicate is just as important as what they communicate. As AI continues to advance, projects like GibberLink may well pave the way for a new era of machine-optimized communication, transforming how we interact with and utilize artificial intelligence.

After a period of scaling back due to regulatory headwinds, prominent market maker Jump Trading is signaling a significant shift. They are doubling down on their U.S. crypto operations , a move that speaks volumes about the evolving regulatory landscape and the burgeoning opportunities within the digital asset space. Is this the start of a broader trend? Let’s dive into what this means for the market and what’s driving Jump Trading’s strategic pivot. Why the U-Turn on U.S. Crypto Operations? For those in the know, Jump Trading is a powerhouse in the global financial markets, known for its sophisticated trading strategies and significant presence in various asset classes. However, the past few years have presented challenges for crypto firms operating in the United States. Increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly after events like the Terra (LUNA) and FTX collapses, led many companies to reassess their U.S. involvement. Jump Trading was no exception, reportedly scaling back its U.S. crypto activities amidst this uncertainty. So, what’s changed? The narrative points towards a more constructive regulatory climate . While the regulatory landscape is still evolving, there are signals suggesting a potential shift towards greater clarity and perhaps a more accommodative stance. This perceived improvement is likely emboldening firms like Jump Trading to reinvest in the U.S. market. It’s not about abandoning compliance; it’s about operating with a clearer understanding of the rules of the game. Here’s a breakdown of the factors likely influencing Jump Trading’s decision: Perceived Regulatory Progress: While comprehensive crypto regulations are still in development, there might be a growing sense of direction and a less overtly hostile approach from U.S. regulators. This could involve subtle shifts in enforcement priorities or clearer signals about future frameworks. Market Maturity: The crypto market, despite its volatility, is maturing.

Jump Trading and other firms operating in the crypto space must remain vigilant and adaptable. Key challenges include: Evolving Regulations: The specific rules and frameworks for crypto regulation are still being developed. Firms need to stay ahead of these changes and ensure compliance in a dynamic environment. Enforcement Risks: Even with a more constructive approach, regulatory enforcement remains a possibility. Companies must maintain robust compliance programs and risk management practices. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Firms need to manage risk effectively and navigate periods of market turbulence. Competition: As the U.S. crypto market becomes more attractive, competition will intensify. Jump Trading will need to innovate and maintain its competitive edge. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts, investors, and industry participants, Jump Trading’s move offers several key takeaways: Monitor Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about the evolving U.S. regulatory climate .

41198087,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137228,1741198460,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Positive Outlook: China & Germany Fiscal Boost Could Spark Crypto Market Relief,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-fiscal-stimulus-relief/,"Is the crypto winter finally thawing? Investors are keenly watching global economic indicators for signs of respite, and recent announcements from economic powerhouses China and Germany could be just the catalyst the crypto market needs. Let’s dive into how fiscal stimulus from these nations might translate into much-needed relief for the digital asset space, and potentially ignite a new phase of growth for Bitcoin and beyond. Fiscal Stimulus: A Potential Game Changer for the Crypto Market In times of economic uncertainty, governments often turn to fiscal stimulus to inject life into their economies. But what exactly is fiscal stimulus, and why should crypto enthusiasts care? Fiscal stimulus refers to government measures aimed at increasing aggregate demand in an economy. This can take various forms, such as increased government spending, tax cuts, or transfer payments. The goal is to boost economic activity, create jobs, and prevent or mitigate recessions. For the crypto market , which often behaves as a risk-on asset class, broader economic health is crucial. When traditional markets face headwinds, investors tend to become risk-averse, sometimes leading to capital flight from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a healthy global economy, bolstered by measures like fiscal stimulus , can create a more favorable environment for risk-taking and investment in digital assets. Think of it like this: Economic Downturn: Fear and uncertainty rise, investors pull back from riskier assets like crypto. Fiscal Stimulus Introduced: Governments inject money into the economy, aiming to boost growth and confidence. Improved Economic Outlook: As confidence returns and economies stabilize, investors become more willing to explore riskier, potentially higher-return assets like crypto. China’s Consumption-Driven Fiscal Push China , a major global economic player, has signaled a significant shift in its economic strategy. Facing internal and external economic pressures, the nation has announced a raised fiscal deficit target. This move indicates a clear intention to increase government spending. Crucially, there’s a stated plan to transition towards consumption-driven growth. What does this mean? Historically, China’s economic growth has been heavily reliant on investment and exports. A shift to consumption-driven growth implies a greater focus on boosting domestic demand. This could involve: Increased consumer spending: Policies aimed at encouraging Chinese citizens to spend more, such as subsidies, tax breaks, or direct payments. Support for domestic businesses: Measures to bolster local businesses and industries catering to the domestic market. Infrastructure investment: Continued investment in infrastructure, but potentially with a greater focus on projects that directly benefit consumers and improve quality of life. Why is this relevant to crypto? A robust Chinese economy, fueled by increased consumption and government spending, can contribute to global economic stability. Furthermore, increased liquidity and a potentially weakened dollar (more on that later) resulting from fiscal expansion can indirectly benefit the crypto market . Germany’s Massive Spending Commitment Meanwhile, in Europe, Germany , the continent’s largest economy, has also unveiled substantial fiscal plans. Germany has committed hundreds of billions of euros to defense and infrastructure. This is a significant departure from Germany’s traditionally conservative fiscal stance and signals a strong commitment to bolstering both national security and economic growth. The German stimulus package is primarily focused on: Defense Spending: A substantial increase in defense budgets, reflecting geopolitical realities and a commitment to NATO obligations. Infrastructure Investment: Large-scale investments in infrastructure projects, including transportation, energy, and digital infrastructure. This aims to modernize the German economy, improve productivity, and create jobs. Germany’s commitment to large-scale spending injects significant capital into the European economy and beyond. Like China’s stimulus, this German fiscal expansion can contribute to global economic stability and potentially create a more favorable environment for investment in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, a stronger Eurozone economy, partly driven by German stimulus, can also influence global currency dynamics. Dollar Weakness and Crypto’s Upside One of the most immediate and potentially impactful consequences of these large-scale fiscal stimulus plans from China and Germany is the potential weakening of the US dollar. Why does this happen, and how does it relate to Bitcoin? Generally, expansionary fiscal policy can, under certain circumstances, lead to currency depreciation. Increased government spending or tax cuts can lead to: Increased money supply: Stimulus measures often involve injecting more money into the economy. Potential inflation: Increased demand driven by stimulus can, in some cases, lead to inflationary pressures. Reduced attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets: Concerns about inflation or currency devaluation can make dollar-denominated assets less attractive to international investors. A weaker dollar has historically been seen as a tailwind for assets like Bitcoin . Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin, priced in dollars, can become relatively more attractive to investors seeking alternative stores of value. This is because a weaker dollar makes it cheaper for investors holding other currencies to buy Bitcoin. The original report mentioned Bitcoin climbing nearly 3%. While specific percentage gains can fluctuate rapidly in the crypto market, the underlying principle holds: fiscal stimulus and a potentially weaker dollar can create a more supportive macroeconomic backdrop for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Navigating Uncertainty and Potential Challenges While the fiscal stimulus announcements from China and Germany offer a glimmer of hope for crypto market relief , it’s crucial to acknowledge that the economic landscape remains complex and uncertain. Several factors could influence the actual impact of these stimulus measures on the crypto space: Implementation Effectiveness: The success of fiscal stimulus depends heavily on effective implementation. Delays, inefficiencies, or unintended consequences could dampen the positive effects. Inflationary Pressures: While moderate inflation can be tolerated, excessive inflation could erode purchasing power and potentially trigger central bank responses (like interest rate hikes) that could negatively impact risk assets. Geopolitical Risks: Unforeseen geopolitical events could overshadow the positive effects of fiscal stimulus and trigger risk-off sentiment in global markets. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations remain a significant factor. Positive regulatory developments could amplify the benefits of fiscal stimulus, while negative developments could counteract them. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors take away from these developments? Monitor Global Economic Indicators: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic data, including inflation figures, GDP growth, and currency movements. These indicators can provide valuable insights into the broader economic environment influencing the crypto market. Track Fiscal Policy Developments: Stay informed about fiscal policy announcements and their implementation, not just in China and Germany, but globally. Diversify Your Portfolio: While fiscal stimulus can be a positive catalyst, diversification remains key in the volatile crypto market. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed on Regulatory Updates: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the crypto space, as these can significantly impact market sentiment and price action. Conclusion: A Ray of Hope for Crypto? The coordinated fiscal stimulus efforts from major economies like China and Germany present a potentially positive shift in the macroeconomic landscape for the crypto market . By aiming to boost economic growth and potentially weaken the dollar, these measures could alleviate some of the pressure that has weighed on digital assets. While uncertainties remain, the commitment to fiscal expansion offers a ray of hope and suggests that the crypto winter might just be starting to thaw, paving the way for a more optimistic future for Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem.

41198071,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/coliseums-mission-to-revolutionize-competitive-gaming-and-web3-esports,1741198480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41198071.jpeg,Coliseum’s Mission to Revolutionize Competitive Gaming and Web3 Esports,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/coliseums-mission-to-revolutionize-competitive-gaming-and-web3-esports,"The esports industry is in a state of flux. While traditional gaming tournaments continue to thrive, Web3 gaming—once hailed as the future of digital competition—has struggled to find its footing. 2024 was supposed to be the year blockchain gaming went mainstream. Instead, the industry saw mixed adoption, player skepticism, and a lack of sustainable gaming economies. While a few projects like Parallel and Shrapnel gained traction, many others failed to retain users beyond their token rewards. Amid this uncertainty, some companies are taking a different approach—focusing on infrastructure, transparency, and real competitive gameplay rather than just financial incentives. One of those companies is Coliseum, a competitive gaming platform backed by Kraken Ventures, The Chenin Group, and NBA star Kevin Durant’s 35V. Unlike many play-to-earn experiments that peaked and faded, Coliseum is doubling down on tournament-based gaming—a model that has already proven successful in esports. Instead of forcing blockchain into the mix where it doesn’t belong, the company is building a competitive gaming ecosystem first and introducing Web3 elements where they add real value. To understand how Coliseum is navigating this evolving space, we sat down with Thomas Zaepffel, CEO of Coliseum, to discuss their strategy, the challenges Web3 gaming faces, and what’s next for competitive gaming in 2025. The Competitive Gaming Shift: Why Southeast Asia is Key It’s no secret that Southeast Asia has become the global epicenter for esports growth. While North America and Europe have long dominated the professional scene, SEA has emerged as a hotbed for grassroots competitive gaming—especially in mobile esports. Major publishers like Tencent and Garena have aggressively pushed mobile esports in SEA, with games like PUBG Mobile, Mobile Legends, and Free Fire drawing millions of daily players. The region’s affordable internet access, mobile-first culture, and hyper-engaged gaming community have made it the perfect launchpad for esports innovation. Coliseum is well aware of this shift. The company has already hosted high-profile tournaments in the region, including events with Blacklist International and Shatterline FPS, drawing thousands of competitors. Now, it’s doubling down on expansion efforts in Malaysia and Singapore, recognizing these markets as the next frontier for esports and Web3 gaming innovation. ""We see Southeast Asia as a core hub for competitive gaming,"" says Thomas Zaepffel. ""Our long-term strategy involves deepening our partnerships and expanding tournament offerings to create more opportunities for players, studios, and brands to engage with the evolving esports landscape."" Unlike many Web3 gaming platforms that struggle with retention, Coliseum’s approach leans into existing gaming culture—focusing on real competition, skill-based rewards, and community-driven tournaments rather than speculative assets. Coliseum’s $2M Investment Fund: A Different Approach to Web3 Gaming While most blockchain gaming projects are focused on launching their own tokens, Coliseum is investing in the broader infrastructure that will make Web3 gaming more viable. The company recently launched a $2 million Investment Fund, aimed at supporting early-stage Web3 gaming projects, infrastructure solutions, and initiatives focused on transparency and scalability. ""Web3 adoption in gaming won’t happen in isolation—it requires strategic partnerships and a strong ecosystem approach,"" Zaepffel explains. ""Our investment fund is designed to foster the next generation of Web3 gaming infrastructure, ensuring that both developers and players benefit from fair and transparent digital economies."" While gaming giants like Epic Games and Valve remain hesitant to fully embrace Web3, Coliseum’s fund focuses on practical applications—investing in projects that bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 without alienating traditional gamers. Investments range from $50,000 to $250,000 per project, with a focus on real gameplay, infrastructure, and community-building rather than speculative hype. Why Transparency is the Next Big Issue in Web3 Gaming One of the biggest challenges Web3 gaming still faces is a trust deficit. In 2024, several high-profile rug pulls, manipulative tokenomics, and insider trading scandals rocked the industry. Projects like Pixelmon and Fableborne launched with ambitious promises but failed to deliver meaningful gameplay experiences, while on-chain manipulation in meme coin and NFT projects continued to fuel skepticism. This is precisely why Coliseum has made transparency a cornerstone of its investment strategy. One of the company’s first major investments under its fund is BubbleMaps, a leading blockchain analytics platform designed to enhance on-chain transparency. ""Transparency is critical for the future of Web3 gaming,"" Zaepffel says. ""BubbleMaps is solving one of the biggest challenges in blockchain adoption—ensuring users have clear and verifiable insights into project credibility. Our investment reinforces our commitment to building a more transparent and trustworthy gaming environment."" BubbleMaps provides interactive, color-coded visualizations that help users track wallet connections, identify suspicious transactions, and detect potential market manipulation—a much-needed tool in an industry that still struggles with accountability. In the wake of the TRUMP/LIBRA insider trading allegations, where wallets linked to political meme coins exhibited suspicious trading activity, the demand for better on-chain tracking tools has surged. Coliseum’s investment in BubbleMaps is part of a broader push to ensure that Web3 gaming ecosystems don’t repeat the mistakes of the past. What’s Next for Coliseum? With major investments, tournament expansions, and a thriving gaming community, Coliseum is emerging as a leader in the competitive gaming space—one that understands both Web2 and Web3 gamers and is finding practical ways to bring them together. As gaming and esports continue to evolve, Coliseum’s focus remains on delivering a fair, transparent, and rewarding experience for players, game developers, and ecosystem partners. ""We’re at an inflection point where gaming, blockchain, and digital ownership are converging,"" Zaepffel concludes.

Have you committed crypto fraud? Now, in addition to fines and jail time, authorities can also subject you to caning—at least, that's what's being reportedly considered in Singapore. Cryptocurrency scams have become a major concern for Singapore’s government, with fraudsters increasingly using digital assets to bypass banking oversight. Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling said authorities are exploring stricter punishments—including caning—to deter financial crimes. During a parliamentary budget debate on Tuesday, first reported on by major Chinese-language Singaporean news outlet Lianhe Zaobao , Xueling noted that crypto scams accounted for a quarter of all fraud-related losses last year for the region. Criminals tricked victims into converting money into digital assets before transferring them, and others used malware and phishing tactics to drain victims' crypto wallets. Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC) argued that Singapore’s penalties for fraudsters and money mules are too lenient and proposed legal amendments to “enforce mandatory caning for serious crimes.” The MP pointed out that loan sharks' runners handling $10,000 in illegal funds can be caned, while fraudsters stealing $100,000 or more can’t. Sun added that while fraud cases already result in jail sentences, authorities are considering adding caning to the list of punishments for certain financial crimes. To counter the rising threat, Singapore recently passed the Protection from Scams Act, granting police the power to temporarily restrict transactions of suspected scam victims. According to the news outlet, the law is expected to take effect later this year. Caning, it’s worth noting, is a form of corporal punishment enforced in Singapore for various offenses.",Markets|Singapore|Crypto Fraud,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-05 18:15:41

Set to go live on April 1st, the funds will introduce new Bitcoin-backed lending and investment solutions, with external capital acceptance beginning on July 1. The crypto lending industry faced significant turmoil following the collapse of FTX, which led to a wave of bankruptcies among major lenders. However, institutional demand for Bitcoin-native financial products continues to grow. Blockstream revealed that its new investment vehicles include a Bitcoin-backed lending fund, a USD-collateralized borrowing fund, and a hedge fund strategy offering institutional exposure to Bitcoin markets. The lending funds will allow investors to access liquidity without selling their Bitcoin. Blockstream has secured a multi-billion-dollar investment to support these initiatives, as first reported by Bloomberg. Earlier this year, Blockstream unveiled two institutional investment funds – Blockstream Income Fund and Blockstream Alpha Fund – to provide direct exposure to its Bitcoin ecosystem. The Income Fund offers USD-denominated yields by issuing Bitcoin-backed loans ranging from $100,000 to $5 million. Meanwhile, the Alpha Fund focuses on portfolio growth through infrastructure-based revenue streams, such as Lightning Network node operations. These funds mark Blockstream’s expansion into asset management, thereby offering institutional investors new ways to engage with Bitcoin-backed financial products. The move placed it alongside already established crypto investment firms such as Grayscale , Pantera, and Galaxy Digital. Additionally, the firm recently expanded its presence in Asia with the opening of a new office in Tokyo.
