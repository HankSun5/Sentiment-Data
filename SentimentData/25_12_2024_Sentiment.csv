Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Plunged To -0.221% In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst talked about the latest development in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. The “Coinbase Premium Index” refers to a metric that keeps track of the percentage difference between the BTC price on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means the cryptocurrency is trading at a higher rate on Coinbase than on Binance. Such a trend implies there is a higher buying pressure or a lower selling pressure present on the former as compared to the latter. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests that Binance users are participating in a higher amount of buying than Coinbase ones as they have pushed BTC to a higher value there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has seen a sharp decline into the negative region recently, meaning that sellers have appeared on Coinbase. Alongside this selling, the BTC price has also witnessed a decline, which would suggest the negative premium could be the source of it. The cryptocurrency has actually been following the indicator in this manner throughout the year, with its price going up and down alongside buying and selling shifts on Coinbase. The reason behind this relationship potentially lies in the fact that Coinbase is home to US-based institutional investors, who have had a significant presence in the market this year. The Coinbase Premium Index being red right now would naturally imply these giant investors are selling. Considering that BTC’s price has been following the metric, this would be a bearish signal for the asset. There exists another pattern, however, that could imply a different outcome for Bitcoin. As the quant has highlighted in the chart, the metric has seen a rebound whenever its value has gone to the -0.2% mark during the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals The explanation behind the pattern may be that it’s usually around this level of selling that new buyers show up and decide to accumulate on the dip, pushing the metric as well as the price up in the process. The current value of the indicator is sitting at -0.221%, so it’s possible that Bitcoin could be close to reaching a bottom, if it hasn’t already formed one. This would only be, of course, if the institutional investors think that the bull run is still on. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly went under the $93,000 level yesterday, but it seems the coin has found a rebound as its price is now trading around $94,100.

The exchange started when Hoskinson said, “Welcome to the new economy,” in a post about a YouTuber, Zara Dar, who left academia for OnlyFans. The AI bot then continued comparing Dar’s changing career path to the problem that the Cardano team is facing with the smart contract. The bot criticized Cardano’s progress, stating, “Bruh, you running Cardano like she running that PhD.” It also stated that Cardano has not fully developed working smart contracts. Hoskinson asked the bot questions and demanded it back up its claims. In response to the question, the bot changed the focus and said, “Your TPS is so low my response might take till 2025 to process.” Viral debate highlights AI bot’s nature The interaction attracted much attention online, and this was because Hoskinson may not have known that he was conversing with a bot. When a user in the community exposed RoastMaster9000 to be a bot, Hoskinson playfully likened his style to Captain Kirk of Star Trek. In different situations, Kirk, the main character of the series, usually beat AI using their own logic. The HOSKY meme coin account linked to the further replied, “Bot 2 Charles 0,” continuing the lighthearted banter. Hoskinson later admitted that he started wondering what the bot was capable of doing as soon as he realized it was an AI. “I have not seen a bot like this one,” he said. “I was naturally curious of how advanced it could be before it loops and deflects.” After the debate, Hoskinson revealed a project called Me-Box at Input Output Global (IOG), which is still in progress. This initiative is aimed at designing avatars of people for social communication. Hoskinson said he was curious about RoastMaster9000, which is the same as his interest in this project. Cardano (ADA) faces correction The price of Cardano’s ADA fluctuated considerably after a strong rally in November and early December. The cryptocurrency peaked at $1.30 in the first week of December before experiencing a pullback. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.9281 and has had a weekly loss of 13.71% and a 24-hour loss of 0.96%. ADA has a market capitalization of $ 32.64 billion and 35.12 billion tokens in circulation. Nevertheless, ADA retains the leading position in the market, and bearish pressure persists in the asset’s pricing. Crypto analyst Zen has noted ADA has a chance of a further bounce back in early 2025. Zen argues that the recent correction could boost the bull run. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez has compared the current ADA market chart to the 2020 cycle and found similarities that suggest future price increases. In addition to the price dynamics, Cardano’s ecosystem is still being developed. Charles Hoskinson recently complimented Ripple Labs’ Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, calling him “smart and passionate.” This has led to the speculation of a possible collaboration between the two blockchains.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 22:12:00

He expected to see “substantial growth” in the crypto ETF volume and inflows in 2025. OSL is allegedly Hong Kong’s largest custodian of local spot crypto ETFs with over 70% market share. Positive Sentiment to Influence Spot Crypto ETF Outlook Miller perceives that the sentiment surrounding the offering has improved significantly locally and globally. On this premise, he sees the future of spot crypto ETFs as brighter. Also, the OSL executive highlighted the incoming administration in the United States, citing that it will present a more favorable stance for the crypto industry. “The new U.S. administration’s favorable stance toward the crypto industry, coupled with interest rate cuts, has positively impacted global sentiment and cryptocurrency prices,” Miller stated. Hong Kong Launch Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs In April 2024, Hong Kong welcomed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs . Hong Kong became the first jurisdiction in Asia to issue a spot Ethereum ETF. Top firms like China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, and HashKey Capital Limited were endorsed by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This was about four months after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted BTC ETFs in America. On the debut trading day, Hong Kong crypto ETFs recorded a combined trading volume of approximately HK$87.5 million , equivalent to $11.2 million. US Spot Crypto ETFs Outperform its Hong Kong Counterparts The Bitcoin ETFs have up to 4,560 BTC, valued at approximately 444.6 million, as of Dec. 11, and the Ethereum funds hold up to 16,280 ETH ($59.6 million). Still, some entities evaluated the crypto ETFs as underwhelming. Compared to their US counterparts, they are grossly underperforming. The US spot crypto ETFs have a stellar record in terms of volume and inflows. These measures increased when pro-crypto Donald Trump won the election and was reelected as US President. As of early December, US spot Bitcoin ETFs already had a cumulative net inflow of over $34.06 billion, while its Ethereum counterparts saw over $1.78 billion.

The last two days of the week saw total outflows of $1 billion. The recent price declines led to a $17.7 billion drop in the total assets under management (AuM) for Digital Asset ETPs, which is likely influenced by the hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve’s dot plot published on Wednesday. Bitcoin Posts Strong Inflows While these outflows are significant, it is also important to note that the figures represent only 0.37% of total AuM and rank as the 13th largest single-day outflow in history, according to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report . In comparison, the largest single-day outflow occurred in mid-2022 when a $540 million outflow (2.3% of AuM) followed the Fed’s interest rate hike. Although Bitcoin saw some outflows during the week, it ended with net inflows of $375 million, indicating strong market sentiment. On the other hand, short-bitcoin products recorded only $0.4 million in inflows, reflecting a lack of significant interest from short-sellers. The “most dramatic” outflows came from multi-asset investment products, which saw a sharp decline of $121 million last week. On the altcoin front, XRP led the inflows with $8.8 million, followed by Horizen at $4.8 million and Polkadot at $1.9 million over the past week, showing a trend of investors favoring more selective opportunities. Chainlink, Cardano, and Litecoin also received modest inflows of $1.7 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum continued its positive streak and attracted $51 million, while Solana experienced outflows of $8.7 million during the same period. Switzerland Faces Largest Digital Asset Outflows The US continued to lead in digital asset inflows, drawing $567 million over the past week. Brazil and Australia followed with $16.6 million and $10.2 million in inflows, respectively, while other regions saw outflows. Topping the chart with the most outflows during the same period was Switzerland recording $95.1 million, followed by Germany and Canada with $74.7 million and $60.1 million. Outflows were also recorded in Sweden and Hong Kong, with $42.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively.

Whether you’re seasoned in the crypto space or just starting out, understanding which coin to pick is key. This guide looks into the top five cryptocurrencies poised to excel in 2025—BlockDAG (BDAG), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL). Each offers outstanding features and impressive ROI potential, making them essential considerations for your investment portfolio. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) Presale Surpasses $172 Million BlockDAG (BDAG) is a promising layer-1 blockchain noted for its unique DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) architecture, enhancing scalability and transaction speed while ensuring security. Its innovative hybrid consensus mechanism addresses many challenges faced by decentralized networks, distinguishing it from the conventional Proof-of-Work models. Currently in its presale stage, BlockDAG has successfully raised over $172 million, selling more than 17 billion BDAG coins. With a current price of $0.0234 in batch 26, early adopters have realized a staggering 2240% ROI. What sets BlockDAG apart? It offers smart contract capabilities, secure mining options, and optimized performance. From the user-friendly X1 mobile mining app to the robust X10, X30, and X100 miners, BlockDAG provides an environmentally friendly and efficient mining solution that is unmatched. Analysts believe BlockDAG will experience exponential growth by 2025, potentially surpassing many established cryptocurrencies. Its seamless integration with DeFi and NFT platforms bolsters its status as a top crypto pick for 2025. If innovation and growth potential are what you seek, BlockDAG deserves your attention. 2. Ripple (XRP): Enhancing Speed & Reducing Costs Previously known as Ripple, XRP facilitates transactions across various real-world currencies. Priced at approximately $2.18, XRP has seen notable value growth this year. XRP employs a consensus algorithm that accelerates transactions and reduces costs. The decentralized XRP Ledger supports cross-border payments with minimal fees through a trust-less mechanism. Ripple has also launched a stablecoin, RLUSD, boosting its trading volumes. With a design focused on energy efficiency, XRP stands out as a prime investment opportunity. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Leading in dApps & DeFi Ethereum is a well-established decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi). The recent shift to Ethereum 2.0, adopting Proof of Stake (PoS), has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency. Powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and augmented by Layer 2 solutions, Ethereum streamlines transactions and reduces costs. With the current trading price around $3,336, forecasts indicate ETH could reach new peaks by 2025, affirming its position as a top investment choice. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Fueling the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB), valued at $676.60, reflects a significant increase over the past year. BNB is integral to the Binance ecosystem, offering trading fee discounts, and powers the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that supports dApps and smart contracts. BNB’s utility spans DeFi applications, staking, and merchant payments. Currently nearing the $265.90 support level, analysts predict a rebound if this level holds, suggesting a strong future performance, making BNB a solid investment. 5. Solana (SOL): Fast Transactions with Low Fees Solana, priced at about $182.65 after a recent 23% drop, could see a turnaround if bullish momentum builds. Known for rapid transactions and low fees, Solana employs a unique Proof of History (PoH) system to enhance efficiency and scalability. With a vibrant ecosystem that includes dApps, NFTs, and DeFi projects, Solana’s ease of integration, eco-friendliness, and developer-friendly tools continue to attract users, making it an attractive crypto investment. Top Crypto to Buy Now As we approach 2025, the cryptocurrency market is ripe with opportunities. While Ethereum, Ripple, Binance Coin, and Solana are all strong contenders with proven track records and ongoing advancements, BlockDAG, with its groundbreaking technology and impressive ROI, captures the spotlight. By highlighting its growing ecosystem and technical advancements, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a dominant force in the competitive crypto market, making it a top crypto to buy for future gains.

Top coins poised for massive growth,https://crypto.news/which-crypto-will-explode-in-2025/,"With Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections, the cryptocurrency market has entered a strong growth phase, reigniting excitement across the space. A long-awaited milestone has been achieved with Bitcoin — its price has soared past the $106,000 mark. The crypto bull market is in full swing, leaving everyone wondering: what’s next? Which coin will explode in 2025? And which crypto has 1000x potential? Here’s a guide to the crypto coins to watch as we head into next year. Table of Contents The criteria for a crypto explosion Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Expert predictions for 2025 Risks and considerations The criteria for a crypto explosion With more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies out there today, only a small portion ever achieve real success. Why? The key lies in their utility, scalability, and adoption. Cryptos that succeed often focus on offering something useful, whether that’s speeding up transactions, cutting down on fees, or boosting privacy. For instance, projects that support decentralized finance or enable smart contracts often gain traction due to their innovative applications. You might also like: What is DeFi? Understanding Decentralized Finance and its uses A crypto’s success depends heavily on scalability — blockchains that can process lots of transactions without slowing down or hiking up costs stand out. This reliability makes them more attractive as demand for seamless digital transactions grows. Strong community support, solid partnerships, and strategic market positioning drive adoption, bolstered by a transparent and experienced development team. Cryptos that are decentralized attract users looking for security, privacy, and control, as no single entity has all the power. This openness builds trust and transparency. Centralized cryptos, on the other hand, often spark concerns about control and transparency since one entity holds the reins. Many users prefer decentralization for its autonomy and lower risk of manipulation. Without these foundational elements, many cryptocurrencies simply fail to stand out in the increasingly crowded market. Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Which cryptocurrency will explode in 2025? As the market evolves, certain coins show immense potential for rapid growth. Here are some crypto coins to watch. Ethereum Ethereum 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is clear, with its key role in powering decentralized applications and smart contracts. With the rise of DeFi and NFTs , Ethereum ( ETH ) is well-positioned to retain its dominant position. After transitioning to Ethereum 2.0 in 2022, the network’s scalability and energy efficiency have improved, allowing it to handle more transactions without compromising security. Looking ahead, the Pectra upgrade planned for 2025 will enhance Ethereum’s scalability even further, enabling it to process more transactions and introducing innovative features like social recovery for wallet access. This is expected to make Ethereum even more robust, positioning it for future growth in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Solana Solana 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Solana ( SOL ) continues to make waves in the blockchain space, standing out for its impressive transaction speed and low fees, which are attracting developers across various industries. The network’s growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force. While it has faced some network issues in the past, Solana’s ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem. With its unique ability to process transactions quickly and an expanding user base, Solana is well-positioned for continued success in 2025​. Chainlink Chainlink 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Chainlink ( LINK ) is a decentralized oracle network that plays a crucial role in connecting blockchains with real-world data. Its ability to securely transmit external information to smart contracts makes it invaluable to the blockchain ecosystem. With expanding partnerships and increasing use in DeFi and smart contracts, Chainlink is on a strong growth trajectory. As the demand for blockchain-based data services continues to rise, Chainlink is well-positioned to see significant upside potential. Chainlink’s growing adoption, including partnerships with major companies like Google Cloud, SWIFT, and the World Economic Forum, showcases its increasing importance. As demand for decentralized data services grows, Chainlink’s unique position in blockchain infrastructure positions it for significant growth, especially as blockchain technology expands into more industries. Expert predictions for 2025 As 2025 approaches, experts present a range of predictions for Ethereum, highlighting its critical role in the evolving cryptocurrency space. Some foresee ETH breaking new records, possibly surpassing $5,000, fueled by growing demand and its limited supply dynamics. Other projections are more optimistic, envisioning ETH prices potentially crossing $10,000, fueled by institutional interest and strong market fundamentals. Predictions for Chainlink’s performance in 2025 vary, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Analysts suggest that LINK could climb to a range of $30.69 to $38.26 by year-end, driven by growing adoption and ongoing technological advancements. Others, like Nick Petisce, suggest a more optimistic outlook, proposing that LINK could soar to $2,000-$6,000 within the next 3-5 years, driven by the adoption of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and partnerships with major financial institutions. Similarly, Solana has garnered attention for its high transaction speeds and low fees, attracting developers across various industries. While specific 2025 price predictions for SOL are less prevalent, the network’s growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force in the blockchain space. Ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem, positioning Solana for continued success in the coming years.

Even strong projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are not exempt from market turbulence or external disruptions like regulatory crackdowns. Price volatility can lead to significant losses if you’re not prepared. Predictions from experts offer guidance but don’t guarantee outcomes. Additionally, the crypto space often attracts fraudulent schemes, making due diligence crucial. Take time to analyze each coin’s fundamentals, consider its long-term potential, and never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

38074272,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322348,1735080979,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38074272.jpeg,Argentina Freezes $3.5M USDT Linked to Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme: Report,https://cryptonews.com/news/argentina-freezes-3-5m-usdt-linked-to-rainbowex-ponzi-scheme-report/,"Argentine authorities have taken decisive action against Rainbowex, an alleged Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors, primarily in Buenos Aires’ San Pedro region. A judicial order compelled Tether, the issuer of USDT, to freeze approximately $3.5 million in cryptocurrency linked to the platform on December 24. The investigation into Rainbowex has led to multiple raids, arrests, and international warrants. Source: iProup Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme Busted: How $3.5M USDT Was Frozen Following Multiple Arrests and Raids According to the source close to the case , the legal action to freeze Rainbowex’s digital assets follows months of intensive investigation and enforcement operations. Argentine law enforcement agencies conducted over 15 raids nationwide, targeting locations associated with Rainbowex and its operators. As a result, four individuals, including Luis Pardo, Maximiliano Braga, Facundo Villalba, Mariano Diez, and Andrés Desanzo, were apprehended. An additional arrest warrant was issued for Alexis Pan, who remains at large. The authorities’ efforts also extended beyond Argentina, as the Buenos Aires Justice Department coordinated with Interpol to issue red notices for two Malaysian nationals believed to be key figures behind the scheme. The raids yielded important evidence of the scheme’s operations, including the seizure of 30 million pesos (worth approximately $1.48M) in cash, distributed across various currencies such as dollars, yuan, and euros. This crypto seizure is yet one of the biggest this year. Investigations revealed that Rainbowex posed as a legitimate crypto investment platform, promising substantial returns. However, investors began reporting issues when they attempted to withdraw their funds, which ultimately exposed the platform as a fraudulent closed-loop system disconnected from public blockchains. The Role of Tether and the Controversy of USDT Blacklisting It was noted that Tether’s ability to blacklist wallets implicated in illicit activities helped largely in the asset freeze process. Following a court order, Tether disabled transactions for the wallet holding Rainbowex’s USDT, which effectively froze all the funds. Rodrigo Mansilla, a blockchain expert, explained that the blacklisting process renders any transaction—whether sending or receiving USDT—impossible once a wallet is flagged. This functionality, embedded in the USDT smart contract, checks the wallet’s status before permitting transactions. If the address is blacklisted, the contract sets a boolean value to “false,” blocking any movement of assets. While this mechanism is lauded as a critical tool for law enforcement, it has sparked debate over the decentralization of stablecoins. “This centralized blocking capability calls into question the supposed decentralization of USDT, even when stored on a decentralized blockchain,” Mansilla expressed. Mansilla pointed out that although USDT operates on decentralized blockchains, Tether’s ability to control it centrally contradicts the core principles of decentralization. Maximiliano Firtman, a computer specialist, shared a similar sentiment on the blacklisting process, noting that Tether’s ability to freeze assets indefinitely raises concerns about the potential for permanent loss of funds. However, Firtman also indicated that Tether could mint new tokens to replace the frozen USDT and transfer them to a wallet designated by the judiciary, potentially mitigating the impact on victims. The collaboration between public authorities and the private sector was instrumental in advancing the investigation. Lemon exchange, alongside blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Qlue, provided technical expertise and access to critical data. Judicial sources also confirmed that these companies shared extensive database information, which enabled authorities to track Rainbowex’s financial movements and build a robust case. An earlier report in October revealed that up to 20,000 people had reportedly invested in a fraudulent USDT-themed crypto scheme from RainbowEx . The scheme was promoted by actors and an enigmatic figure called “La China.” The post Argentina Freezes $3.5M USDT Linked to Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Argentina|Ponzi Scheme|USDT stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-24 22:56:19
33767162,[object Object],1735081205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Singapore Takes the Lead Over Hong Kong in Asia’s Crypto Hub Race – Here’s Why,https://bitcoinist.com/singapore-takes-the-lead-over-hong-kong-in-crypto/,"A recent Bloomberg report has revealed that in 2024, Singapore was able to solidify its position as a leading digital asset hub in Asia, surpassing Hong Kong in “regulatory efficiency and appeal” to crypto firms. Particularly, the city-state issued 13 crypto licenses this year, more than double the number granted in 2023. Prominent global players such as OKX, Upbit, Anchorage, BitGo, and GSR secured regulatory approval , highlighting Singapore’s growing attractiveness for digital asset operators. In contrast, Hong Kong has faced “slower progress” under its licensing regime, with only seven fully licensed platforms and several others holding provisional permits. Regulatory Differences Shape Regional Competitiveness Amid this discrepancy, industry experts point to regulatory restrictions in Hong Kong as a significant factor behind its lag. They mentioned that the city’s stringent rules around custody of customer assets, token listing, and delisting policies have made it challenging for exchanges to operate profitably. Additionally, trading is restricted to high-liquidity cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, limiting opportunities for altcoin investments. This cautious approach has led prominent exchanges such as OKX and Bybit to withdraw their licensing applications in Hong Kong, redirecting their focus toward Singapore. Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at consultancy TRM Labs noted: “Hong Kong’s regulatory regime for exchanges is more restrictive in a number of ways that matter — such as custody of customer assets and token listing and delisting policies. This may have tipped the balance in Singapore’s favor.” Diverging Approaches to Crypto Innovation Singapore’s regulatory framework has been praised for its balanced approach, promoting collaboration between new entrants and established financial institutions . Bloomberg pointed out that initiatives like Project Guardian and Global Layer 1, backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, aim to accelerate asset tokenization and drive blockchain adoption across wholesale financial markets. These efforts have positioned Singapore as a long-term, stable choice for companies seeking a regional headquarters for their digital asset operations. In contrast, while Hong Kong has also achieved milestones, such as the sale of HK$6 billion ($770 million) in tokenized green bonds and the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , adoption has been slower. The combined assets under management for these ETFs in Hong Kong stand at around $500 million—significantly lower than the $120 billion held by equivalent products in the United States. Experts suggest that Hong Kong’s emphasis on established financial institutions leaves limited space for innovative startups, slowing the pace of digital asset sector growth.

On-chain metrics indicate a notable shift in exchange activity, with Tether (USDT) seeing significant outflows while Bitcoin (BTC) inflows into exchanges remain elevated. This trend suggests a potential “imbalance” in market dynamics, where selling pressure could lead to further price corrections in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Fueling Potential Dip – $90K Support Crucial Level To Hold Spot Market Trends and Selling Pressure Signal Possible Downturn According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Onatt, more than 15,000 BTC have been observed moving into exchanges, a metric typically associated with an increased likelihood of sell-offs. Simultaneously, Tether outflows imply a reduction in liquidity within these exchanges. Tether Outflows and Bitcoin Inflows Signal Short-Term Weakness “Significant amounts of Tether (USDT) are exiting exchanges, and a large inflow of Bitcoin (BTC) (>15K) has been observed entering exchanges.” – By @tutunculeronat Link 👇https://t.co/NFCLi7EpiI pic.twitter.com/6lUyTiEdNi — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 24, 2024 Historically, such movements have been linked to short-term price declines, as traders and institutional investors reposition their portfolios amid market volatility. However, Onatt noted that while these indicators suggest short-term downside risk, there appears to be no significant macroeconomic catalyst to drive a prolonged bearish trend. The analyst particularly wrote: This combination of factors may indicate a potential for further short-term downside in Bitcoin’s price. However, from a macroeconomic perspective, there doesn’t appear to be a catalyst that would necessitate a prolonged bearish trend after this short-term correction. Key Indicators Suggest Mixed Signals in the Bitcoin Market TraderOasis, another analyst, highlighted additional metrics influencing Bitcoin’s price behavior. One key observation focused on the Coinbase Premium Index, which failed to follow Bitcoin’s upward movement during its last price surge. Oasis noted: As a result, the price retreated. We are now in negative territory. I expect a break in the market for the continuation of the rise. Notably, this disconnect indicates a lack of strong buying activity from US-based investors, often considered a significant driver of Bitcoin’s upward momentum. The analyst also noted that the funding rates have started to decline while open interest levels have been rising. Falling funding rates coupled with rising open interest typically indicate that traders are opening more short positions. This pattern suggests bearish sentiment in the derivatives market, with traders expecting a continuation of the downward trend or, at best, a period of sideways movement.

TraderOasis wrote: I think the price will move sideways due to the Christmas week. Then the distribution movement will start.

According to a new report from the state-controlled TASS, the complete ban will affect regions including Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, and the recently annexed territories of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The prohibition is reported to remain in effect until March 15, 2031. In addition, three Siberian regions — Irkutsk, Buryatia and Zabaikalsky — will face seasonal mining restrictions during peak energy consumption periods. These limitations will run from January to mid-March 2025, expanding to November through March in subsequent years. The measures follow cryptocurrency mining legislation signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2024, aimed at preventing power shortages and blackouts. The energy-intensive nature of proof-of-work crypto mining has reportedly strained Russia’s power grid, particularly in regions with limited infrastructure, according to TASS. Both individual miners and mining pools must cease operations during restricted periods, marking Russia’s most aggressive step yet to address its energy challenges while maintaining economic stability. Earlier this year, Bitcoin ( BTC ) miners based in Russia mined billions of dollars worth of the top crypto asset by market cap last year.

The survey, which included 1,000 UAE-based retail investors, aimed to identify their financial goals for the upcoming year. According to the results, 54% of respondents listed financial objectives as their primary New Year’s resolutions, ranging from stock investments to buying more cryptocurrencies. Approximately 40% of participants expressed plans to increase their exposure to stocks, bonds, and commodities, while 38% aimed to invest in real estate. Meanwhile, 37% revealed their goal to boost crypto investments. Strategies for Achieving Financial Goals When asked about their strategies to meet these objectives, 51% of respondents said they would increase their overall savings or investment contributions. Additionally, 41% planned to implement detailed budget and expense tracking, while 38% aimed to adopt more mindful and frugal lifestyles. A further 28% stated they would cut back on shopping and dining out to save money. Some respondents also emphasized increasing their earnings. About 32% planned to start side hustles, while 28% intended to switch careers to secure higher salaries. eToro regional manager George Naddaf commented on the survey results, saying they reflect an innovative approach to wealth building. “2025’s resolutions highlight a proactive approach to not just financial security but also a desire for self-improvement and adaptability,” Naddaf said. He also noted that the UAE demonstrates a forward-thinking mindset, focusing on financial resilience and personal growth. Commitment to Personal Development Beyond financial goals, many survey participants prioritized personal development. The results showed that 41% were strongly committed to self-improvement, while 34% focused on health and well-being.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days.

Additionally, a number of myths are often associated with the technology, which may hamper adoption in the future. Forrester Report Highlights Enterprise Blockchain Myths Forrester Research released a new report detailing the most common blockchain myths from 2014 until present day. Martha Bennett, VP and Principal Analyst at Forrester, told Cryptonews that she compiled the list. She explained that the findings were based on insights and observations gained from research and work with clients on the topic of enterprise blockchain over the years. Bennett shared that she started her research in mid-2014 and hasn’t stopped since. “Over the years key themes associated with blockchain technology have emerged that were frequently taken at surface value by IT and business teams in enterprises,” she said. “I spent lots of time explaining to clients (and non-clients, for that matter) what was myth and what was reality.” Although blockchain has matured greatly over the years, Bennett believes that the myths listed below continue to persist – here’s why: The Blockchain Exists The Forrester report notes that phrases such as “the blockchain will address that” or “putting something on the blockchain” create confusion. This is why it’s worth stressing that the blockchain doesn’t actually “exist.” The report states that “blockchain is an architectural principle that features certain characteristics.” It also states that the underlying concept of blockchain can be realized differently. For instance, there are dozens of public, permissionless blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A wide variety of open-source and proprietary protocols are also available to build permissioned networks. In addition, there are semi-public and hybrid networks whose governance models offer a blend of permissioned and permissionless functions. “Many software offerings aren’t blockchains by any stretch of the imagination because they don’t use blocks,” the report notes. “However, these offerings label themselves as such.” Blockchains Disintermediate And Trusted Third Parties Are No Longer Needed The second myth is that blockchain networks won’t ever fully disintermediate. While blockchain networks support the direct transfer of value between two parties, third parties are still needed for enterprise blockchain use cases. “The only way to cut out third parties altogether is for consumers or businesses to self-custody their wallets and interact with a blockchain directly, which is not a realistic proposition for mainstream business relationships,” the report states. “Even in scenarios where ecosystem partners deal directly with each other at the expense of existing third parties, it doesn’t mean third parties are no longer part of the mix.” The document adds that cryptocurrency use cases rely on third parties, such as wallet providers, exchanges, and custody services. Blockchains Are Decentralized Third on the list of myths is that blockchains are decentralized. However, decentralization is more complex than it may seem. decentralization is THE single most important tenet in crypto. without it, we’re really no different to traditional financial systems. — TINA (@thetinaverse) December 23, 2024 “Even the public Bitcoin and Ethereum networks aren’t completely decentralized,” the report states. “On the contrary, miners and core developers in effect exercise a form of central control, and those small groups aren’t accountable to anybody.” Findings also state that elements of centralization are present in cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (Dapps) . As a result, it’s noted that the term “decentralization theater” has become popular for describing networks or applications that claim to be decentralized but aren’t. Blockchains Are Trustless While a blockchain network can facilitate the exchange of information between people or entities that do not know or trust each other, that doesn’t mean the technology is entirely trustless. According to the report, participants still trust the functioning of these networks. For example, participants need to trust the mathematics and cryptography, along with the network’s code. Users also need to trust those who effectively control the respective networks, such as those with the resources to add blocks to the chain and the developers who can modify the core code. Blockchains Are Immutable A key characteristic of a blockchain network is immutability, yet the report explains that this isn’t always the case and notes that for enterprises, immutability isn’t always desirable. According to the report, changes can be made to the blockchain. “One is to recompute the chain, either in its entirety or to the point before an undesirable event occurred; this erases and recreates history,” the report states. “The other is to fork the chain, which preserves historical code and transactions but means the software now works differently, and ownership may have been reassigned.” Blockchains Are Inherently More Secure The report also points out that blockchains may not be more secure unless these features are designed into the network . For instance, in some cases, participants will have access to credentials to access a network. This creates a security vulnerability. Even networks with multiple nodes are susceptible to attacks. Nodes are the backbone of blockchain. Verifying transactions, ensuring security, and powering decentralization—every node is a piece of freedom in Web3. Want to truly support the crypto revolution? Run a node and join the movement. #Blockchain #Crypto #Decentralization pic.twitter.com/A4GFTbbGGS — Oleksandr Bagnyuk (@AlexBagnyuk) December 15, 2024 “The more nodes there are in the network, the more choices there are for somebody with evil intent to find one that’s less well protected,” the report states. Blockchains Are “Truth Machines” While blockchains may be viewed as single sources of truth, malicious actors can still take over. The report points out that if somebody registers property ownership, the system can’t tell whether this is really the rightful owner. “Similarly, it can’t tell whether the consent for data usage has been obtained legitimately,” the report states. “Sensor data can be manipulated, either by tampering with the sensor itself or by intercepting the data stream.” Blockchains Automatically Improve Data Quality Although blockchain networks work well for ensuring data integrity, the report highlights that data quality issues must be addressed before information is written on the blockchain. The same applies to data that triggers a smart contract. “If nobody establishes and ensures the required data quality standards before the network launches or data is written to a blockchain-supported back end in a centrally controlled service, the shortcoming will be obvious very soon,” the report notes. Transparency Can Only Be Good All transactions on the blockchain are transparent, but this isn’t always beneficial for enterprises. Given this, the report notes that confidentiality is the biggest technical challenge developers need to resolve. Although progress has been made around confidentiality-preserving mechanisms, these remain complex. “Algorithmic zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) — aren’t ready for enterprise prime time,” the report states. S mart Contracts Will Make Lawyers Redundant The myth that smart contracts will replace lawyers is addressed as myth number 10. While smart contracts are able to automate certain processes , the report notes that “code is not law.” “Even if participants in a network wish to abide by the results of smart contract execution, they still need a separate legal agreement that states as much and captures other standard contractual principles,” the report states. Build It, And They Will Come As blockchain technology matures, enterprises are thought to be more likely to adopt solutions. This may not be the case, though. The report notes that between June 2022 and January 2024, many enterprise blockchain initiatives ended in failure. Fortunately, decision-makers who want to avoid a similar fate are now realizing key lessons. According to the report, enterprises must consider ecosystem partners’ and customers’ needs and wants. Businesses using blockchain solutions should not expect a commercial model to develop organically. Finally, enterprises should conduct in-depth research on blockchain software before implementing a solution. The report warns that large businesses must proceed carefully when using blockchain technology. “A key contributor to the failure of TradeLens was Maersk’s dominant position in the market. Even if everything else had been just so (which it wasn’t), Maersk’s sheer size concerned smaller ecosystem participants, which feared Maersk would learn too much about them, while Maersk’s major competitors weren’t that interested in becoming part of a Maersk-led network, despite IBM’s participation,” the report states.

Table of Contents XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently Cardano’s rise amid market shifts Lightchain AI to transform blockchain technology Why Lightchain AI could steal the spotlight Tokenomics and roadmap A seasoned trader has declared XRP’s price is now firmly anchored above $1, signaling strong momentum for the token. While XRP celebrates this milestone, the spotlight is shifting toward Cardano (ADA) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , two projects poised for explosive growth. Cardano’s consistent development and robust ecosystem continue to attract attention, but it’s Lightchain AI, priced at just $0.003 during its presale, that’s stealing headlines. With unique technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), LCAI is redefining blockchain and AI, offering unmatched growth potential. XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently XRP, the cryptocurrency issued by Ripple, recently surged above the $1 mark. This significant increase has been attributed to several factors: Regulatory developments – The New York Department of Financial Services approved Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, pegged to the U.S. dollar. This approval is expected to enhance XRP’s value and utility within Ripple’s digital payments platform. Political climate – The election of President Donald Trump has led to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Trump’s appointment of Paul Atkins, known for his supportive stance on cryptocurrencies, as SEC head may ease previous legal challenges faced by Ripple. Analysts are optimistic about XRP’s future, with some predicting that it could reach a price range of $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025. However, investors should remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Cardano’s rise amid market shifts In the middle of new market changes, Cardano (ADA) has shown great rise. Over the last four days ADA’s price jumped by 32%, making its market value $14.932 billion and firming it as ninth-largest coin by market value. This big rise shows more interest and trust in Cardano from investors. Additionally, money rates for Cardano have gotten a clear lift. This shows more hope among traders. People are happy to pay extra for long bets, which m͏eans they think prices will go up some more. These changes show Cardano’s ability to take advantage of market speed and make itself a strong player in the changing crypto world.

At the heart of its technology lies the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which is set to redefine blockchain validation. Unlike traditional methods like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI will incentivize nodes to perform meaningful AI computations, such as model training and inference. This will not only enhance scalability and security but also reduce energy consumption, making Lightchain AI a sustainable alternative for modern blockchain applications. Also central to its technological breakthrough is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a state-of-the-art computational layer optimized for AI workloads. The AIVM will enable developers to deploy advanced, data-driven dApps with high efficiency. Supporting interoperability with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, the AIVM will ensure smooth integration of existing models into Lightchain AI’s ecosystem. Through these innovations, Lightchain AI will set a new benchmark for decentralized intelligence, fostering a transparent, inclusive, and high-performance blockchain environment. Lightchain AI’s approach to decentralization will also tackle systemic issues like AI bias and centralized control. By incorporating federated learning and decentralized governance, the platform will empower community-driven decision-making and ensure fairness in AI applications. With its presale already in Stage 8, raising over $4.16 million, Lightchain AI is not just a technological platform — it’s a revolution poised to reshape the blockchain landscape.

The media outlet wrote that “crypto industry” insiders said on December 24 that “negotiations between Megazone and Binance” over the sale of GOPAX “have not progressed since October.” Ruling party nominates 5-term lawmaker Kwon to head emergency committee https://t.co/4h4jsPxwR4 — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 24, 2024 ‘Nothing Has Been Confirmed’ Chosun wrote that Megazone “stated that nothing has been confirmed regarding the acquisition discussions with GOPAX.” The company claimed that talks are “still in progress.” But it also suggested “there are currently no actual discussions or plans in place.” Chosun added: “Megazone and Binance have not spoken directly of late. And industry sources have come to the conclusion that Megazone has effectively given up on the acquisition deal.” A further wrinkle comes in the form of GOPAX’s debt to creditors as a result of the failure of its GOPAY crypto staking services. Binance has expressed its willingness to clear the debt with its own capital if it is allowed to complete the takeover. @Binance has solidified its position as the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, boasting $21.6 billion in customer deposits for 2024. #Binance #Bitcoin https://t.co/7sa3tc9GSh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 13, 2024 Megazone: Buyer Getting Cold Feet? Megazone, meanwhile, had agreed a deal in principle to buy most of Binance’s shares. However, as most of the GOPAY debt is in the form of crypto, the task of satisfying creditors has become increasingly daunting. Bitcoin (BTC) prices have soared since the October talks, rising from just over $60,000 to an all-time high of above $106,000 in recent weeks. Bitcoin prices in 2024. (Source: CoinMarketCap) GOPAX’s GOPAY woes began in 2022, with the collapse of the FTX exchange. This caused Genesis, GOPAY’s partner, to declare bankruptcy, saddling GOPAX with the resulting debt. GOPAX has told creditors that it wants to repay unpaid balances “in cash based on the price at the time of the collapse.” But disgruntled creditors say they want their Bitcoin back “as-is.” Chosun wrote that if Megazone “pulls out of the deal, the exchange will not meet financial authorities’ demands. And it explained: “Not only is it extremely unlikely that a new buyer will emerge, but it is also obvious that Gopax’s debt will be a hindrance during takeover negotiations.” Did you know Korea has over 100,000 coffee shops for a population of just 51 million?

But its status may also be under threat. The exchange has applied for a renewal of its Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration recently, with regulators visiting for an on-site inspection last week. The firm received the all-clear, but the newspaper wrote: “If the authorities do not accept the renwal application, citing the change in major shareholders as a problem, GOPAX will have to go through the process of closing down. And then repaying its debts will become even more difficult.” Chosun quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying: “GOPAX has fulfilled all the legal requirements it could. And all that remains is gaining regulatory approval. Fortunately, Binance is still willing to repay GOPAX’s debts and is communicating with the authorities.

SUI continues to find strong support upon retests of its major moving averages, including an impressive bounce last week from the 50DMA. That suggests appetite to buy the dip remains elevated, and pressure could be building for an explosive pop above the $5.0 level in the coming weeks. The bullish Sui price action shouldn’t come as a surprise against the backdrop of booming on-chain activity, souring trading volumes, and a fundamental backdrop that remain a strong tailwind for crypto markets going into 2025. Per DeFi Llama , the USD value of crypto locked in smart contracts on the Sui blockchain is at record highs near $1.8 billion, on-chain volumes are routinely clocking in in the $400 million to $600 million range, and perp volumes are trending back towards their highest levels of the year. Sui’s official X page recently tweeted a summary of the blockchain’s bumper year of growth. 2024 was so awesome for the Sui community, words just aren't enough… …so we decided to use numbers! And trust us, the numbers in this recap are truly impressive pic.twitter.com/W8DwuRYHeh — Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 23, 2024 Meanwhile, though Fed caused a stir in risk assets when it signaled fewer rate cuts in 2025 than the market had been anticipating last week, hopes remain high that the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration and Congress is going to usher in a new golden era for the crypto industry and markets in the US, accelerating global adoption. Bitcoin will steal most of the headlines in 2025 given the potential establishment of a US Bitcoin strategic reserve . However, high performing chains like Sui are also primed to explode. Schwab says #Bitcoin could hit $500K–$1M when Trump establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/3cArfgRYTU — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 6, 2024 Where Next for the Sui (SUI) Price? All that being said, a near-term breakout to the north of $5.0 seems highly likely for the Sui price. But with Sui already in a phase of price discovery, there aren’t too many easily identifiable price targets for the crypto. A 2x rally to $10 is certainly a possibility. But considering Sui’s current market cap of around $46 billion fully diluted ($13.5 billion circulating), much greater than 2x gains could be in store for the crypto. Sui is currently proving itself as one of the best performing layer-1 protocols in the game, and there is scope for significant catch up to its larger rivals like Solana and Ethereum. Solana’s fully diluted market cap was last around $116 billion, while Ethereum’s was last $420 billion, with both also likely to expand significantly in 2025. Could Sui also reach a fully diluted valuation in the hundreds of billions this cycle? It’s certainly a possibility, assuming its chain continues to lead in terms of web3 adoption, as is currently the case. A Sui price in the $20 range becomes a realistic target with if assumptions hold. That means its a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Of course, crypto investors would be best served by spreading their portfolio across a few high-potential coins. Bitcoin could still post 2x gains next year, or even more if strategic reserves gain ground. Other leading tokens like Ethereum and Solana are also likely to perform very well. But Sui is certainly a great addition to any investor’s crypto portfolio.

Ripple (XRP) has reclaimed its bullish momentum, surging past key resistance levels and positioning itself for a strong breakout. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT), despite showing technical promise, struggles to break free from its bearish grip, leaving traders and analysts divided on its immediate future. Amid this dynamic landscape, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves as a groundbreaking presale project. Backed by a high-profile partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is redefining the blockchain wallet ecosystem and expanding into untapped territories like Real World Asset Tokenisation. With over 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly becoming a hot topic in crypto circles. Let’s dive deeper into these three standout projects—Qubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot—to understand why they’re among the best crypto to join this week and how each is carving its niche in the blockchain ecosystem. Qubetics: A Revolution in Blockchain Utility The buzz around Qubetics is palpable, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it aims to bridge real-world applications with blockchain innovation. The recent partnership with SWFT Blockchain has turbocharged its wallet features, offering lightning-fast cross-chain swaps and unmatched security. But the star of the show is its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Game-Changer Imagine a system where property, art, or even corporate bonds can be tokenised and traded on a decentralised platform. That’s precisely what Qubetics is bringing to the table. With this feature, businesses and individuals can turn tangible assets into digital tokens, unlocking liquidity and facilitating seamless global transactions. Picture a small business in Argentina seeking to expand operations. By tokenising a valuable piece of equipment or real estate, the business can attract international investors without the hurdles of traditional finance . Similarly, a professional in Brazil could use Qubetics to diversify their portfolio, owning fractional shares in assets previously out of reach. For individuals, the possibilities are equally exciting. A young entrepreneur in Chile could tokenise intellectual property, securing funding for a startup. This marketplace isn’t just a tool—it’s a paradigm shift, breaking barriers and democratising access to investment opportunities. Why Qubetics Shines Bright What makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to join this week is its ambitious vision paired with tangible solutions. It’s not just about hype; it’s about delivering real-world impact . With 374 million tokens already sold and over $7.7 million raised, the presale’s momentum is hard to ignore. Ripple: Riding the Bullish Wave Ripple, known for its focus on cross-border payments, has always been a strong player in the crypto world. Recently, XRP’s price action has reignited excitement, with the token stabilizing above $2.10 and setting sights on breaking the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP’s resurgence can be attributed to several factors. First, its stronghold in the financial sector, with partnerships spanning major banks and payment processors, reinforces its utility. Recent technical analysis reveals a bullish breakout above $2.20, with XRP trading at $2.25 and targeting the $2.30 resistance. This movement aligns with broader market trends, showcasing XRP’s resilience amid Bitcoin and Ethereum’s fluctuations. Analysts are optimistic that clearing the $2.30 hurdle could push XRP toward $2.50 or higher, reaffirming its relevance in the crypto landscape. Why Ripple Stands Out XRP’s focus on real-world applications, particularly in cross-border remittances, makes it an enduring favourite. Its ability to weather market volatility and emerge stronger underscores its potential as one of the best crypto to join this week. With technical and institutional support, Ripple is well-positioned for sustained growth. Polkadot: A Sleeping Giant? Polkadot has long been hailed for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. However, its recent price movements have left traders scratching their heads. Despite breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, DOT remains in bearish territory, currently trading at $6.83. Mixed Signals in the Market Polkadot’s technical indicators present a mixed bag. On the one hand, the falling wedge breakout suggests potential for a bullish reversal. On the other hand, resistance at $10.88 looms large, making traders wary. Social sentiment around Polkadot is growing, but it hasn’t translated into sustained upward momentum yet. One bright spot is the increased activity in Polkadot’s derivatives market, with long positions slightly outpacing shorts. This indicates some confidence among traders, but the road to a significant rally remains uncertain. Why Polkadot is Worth Watching While Polkadot may not be on an immediate upward trajectory, its robust ecosystem and focus on scalability make it a project with long-term potential. For those looking for diversification in their crypto portfolios, Polkadot remains a project to monitor closely. Understanding Real World Asset Tokenisation with Qubetics Asset tokenisation is not just a buzzword—it’s the future of finance. By converting physical assets into digital tokens, Qubetics enables seamless trading, increased liquidity, and broader access to investment opportunities. How It Works Qubetics’ platform uses blockchain to create digital representations of assets, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. These tokens can be traded globally, bypassing traditional financial systems and their associated costs. Why It Matters This technology opens up new avenues for Latin American countries, where financial systems can be restrictive or volatile. Whether it’s securing loans, attracting foreign investment, or participating in global markets, tokenisation empowers individuals and businesses . The Final Thoughts Based on our research, Qubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot each bring unique value to the table. Qubetics stands out with its ambitious vision and real-world solutions, particularly its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Ripple’s resurgence highlights its resilience and utility, making it a strong contender in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Polkadot’s innovative approach to interoperability positions it as a long-term bet despite its current challenges. If you’re looking for the best crypto to join this week, Qubetics’ ongoing presale is an opportunity worth exploring. With its focus on groundbreaking technology and real-world applications, it’s poised to redefine the blockchain landscape. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey.

Currently trading around $0.30, the Dogecoin price has seen a sharp drop of 25% over the past week, worrying traders and investors as it struggles to hold onto important support levels. This drop raises concerns about a possible further decline. Crypto trader Kevin predicted on November 13 that the Dogecoin price would fall to between $0.26 and $0.28, and this prediction has now come true. Despite facing criticism, he believes that tjw Dogecoin price will eventually recover and aim for new highs, but it may have to go through a significant drop first. Kevin noted that the Dogecoin price is experiencing a typical pullback in a bull market after a “golden cross,” which usually signals future price increases. He highlighted that previous drops have been about 50%, and a 45% pullback could establish key support, keeping the uptrend intact. However, the Dogecoin price closing below $0.26 could signal serious market issues, while the current decline is viewed as normal. RCOF Presale: Invest Now, Reap Huge Rewards While the Dogecoin price is losing steam, RCO Finance is emerging as a frontrunner with its token presale. Projections suggest an astounding 20,000% surge in token value by the first quarter of 2025, attracting a growing number of investors eager to acquire RCOF presale tokens.

He still holds a lot of ETH and believes in its future. Experts are hopeful that Ethereum’s price will rise again. Justin Sun sold ETH, The rumor Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX), rumors about him claiming that he sold a large amount of his Ethereum (ETH). These rumors have started after data showed huge transfers from wallets linked to him. The timing of these transfers also combined with Ethereum’s recent drop in price which made people think Sun was selling his ETH. The issue started when Justin Sun was said to have moved about $143 million worth of Ethereum which is 39,999 ETH to HTX. These transfers happened soon after Ethereum’s drop below $4,000 and that dropped to $3,127. However, Sun explained on X post that he did not sell his Ethereum. He said that the transfers were just internal wallet movements and also confirmed that he still believes in Ethereum’s long-term potential, despite the price drop. Despite the transfers he still holds about 42,904 ETH which is worth around $139 million. Reports show that Sun has moved over 108,919 ETH to HTX since November 10 at an average price of $3,674, time of these transactions usually when prices are high.

Its trading volume, now at $28.64 billion, has also dropped slightly. Analysts think Ethereum could recover well, with some spotting patterns that hint at a possible price rise. Analyst Javon Marks identified “Adam & Eve Double Bottom Pattern,” which could push Ethereum above $4,000 and possibly up to $4,800 in the near future. Despite recent price changes, Ethereum is still a major player in the blockchain world. Its strong role as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and ongoing technological improvements make it an important part of the crypto ecosystem. Sun’s renewed support for Ethereum reflects the overall optimism about its future growth and success. Justin Sun’s clarification has been important in restoring confidence among investors during a time of uncertainty.

Don’t Sleep on This Top Crypto Presale That’s Turning Dips Into Gold with its BIG50 Discount!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-popcat-wealth-boom-dont-sleep-on-this-top-crypto-presale-thats-turning-dips-into-gold-with-its-big50-discount/,"If you’ve been around the cryptocurrency space for a while, you’ve probably heard stories of those who turned small investments into life-changing wealth by getting in on the right coin at the right time. Popcat (POPCAT) is one such example. Those who jumped on the train early witnessed exponential growth, while others watched from the sidelines, regretting their hesitation. Now, a new opportunity is knocking on the door— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With its presale featuring a limited-time rollback to Stage 7 pricing, the potential to secure incredible gains is here again. Don’t miss out this time. BTFD Coin: Seize the Dip and Soar BTFD Coin isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a rallying cry for savvy investors who understand the value of buying low and holding for the moonshot. Its presale has become a hot topic, thanks to its strategic rollback to Stage 7 pricing of $0.000064—a massive 50.77% discount from its current stage price. For those ready to dive in, the opportunity to make 837.5% gains when the coin lists at $0.0006 is simply too good to pass up. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out BTFD isn’t just banking on hype; it’s building an ecosystem that rewards its holders. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards offering an eye-popping 90% APY, and a referral programme incentivising community growth, the project is designed for long-term success. The beta version of the P2E game is already live, showcasing the team’s commitment to delivering value even before the presale ends. While no rewards are earned in the beta version, the final game promises to integrate BTFD tokens, allowing players to earn while they play. Additionally, BTFD’s Bulls Squad—a vibrant community of investors—adds a layer of resilience and collective power to the project. As part of this squad, you’re not just investing in a coin; you’re joining a movement dedicated to seizing opportunities during market dips and riding the wave to financial success. Presale Success and Investment Example The BTFD presale has already raised over $4.44 million, selling more than 58 billion tokens to over 6,500 holders. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, scarcity is engineered into tokenomics. Let’s put the potential gains into perspective. If you invest $3,000 at the current Stage 7 price of $0.000064, you’ll secure approximately 46,875,000 BTFD tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $28,125—an astounding return on investment. Join the BTFD Presale Before the BIG50 Deal Ends Getting in on the action is straightforward: Go to the Presale site and connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “ BIG50 ” in the designated field to claim the discounted Stage 7 price. Input the amount of BTFD tokens you wish to purchase. Review the discounted price and confirm your purchase. This limited-time offer ends on January 5, 2025, so don’t wait too long. The next bull market could be your gateway to financial independence, and BTFD Coin is your ticket. Popcat: The Missed Opportunity Popcat ($POPCAT) burst onto the scene with a quirky yet captivating backstory tied to the viral Popcat meme. It was a community-driven project that leveraged the power of Internet culture to gain massive traction. Early investors who recognised the potential of this unique meme coin reaped the rewards as the token’s value skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of $1.67 in October 2024. Popcat’s Meteoric Rise and Fall POPCAT’s initial success was fuelled by a robust marketing strategy, high-profile exchange listings, and a dedicated community. Its listing on Binance and KuCoin added legitimacy and liquidity, attracting a wave of new investors. The token’s market cap surged as it climbed the crypto rankings, making headlines and creating overnight millionaires. However, like many meme coins, POPCAT’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. After hitting its peak, the token experienced a significant correction, losing over 65% of its value in the following months. This downturn highlighted the volatile nature of meme coins and the importance of timing in the crypto market. Those who missed out during the early stages of POPCAT’s rise often look back with regret, wondering what could have been. Why BTFD is the Best Bet Right Now The story of POPCAT serves as a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration. It underscores the potential of meme coins to deliver astronomical gains but also the necessity of getting in early. With BTFD Coin currently in its presale stage, history is offering a second chance. Don’t be the person who looks back and says, “I should have invested.” Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Next Big Thing The world of cryptocurrency moves fast, and opportunities don’t wait. Popcat’s meteoric rise and subsequent correction are reminders of the potential rewards and risks in this space. While many missed the chance to turn POPCAT into a financial windfall, BTFD Coin presents a fresh opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a promising project. With its limited-time rollback to Stage 7 pricing and an ecosystem designed for long-term growth, BTFD Coin is undoubtedly the top crypto presale of the moment. Act now, claim your discount with the code “ BIG50 ,” and secure your stake in BTFD Coin before the presale ends. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers—join the Bulls Squad today and make 2025 the year you seize the dip and soar to new heights.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 00:26:40

However, the same cannot be said for centralized finance protocols, whose losses have more than doubled in the past year. Hacken’s report shows that DeFi losses represented 20.4% of the total crypto hacks losses, while CeFi accounted for 30% in 2024. However, compared to last year, DeFi losses lessened by 40%, dropping from $787 million in losses to only $474 million in losses this year. CeFi losses skyrocket to $694M in 2024 CeFi losses grew dramatically, rising to $694 million from $339 million in 2023. The DMM Bitcoin hack in May 2024 stood out as the largest CeFi breach, with losses reaching approximately $305 million. About 4502.9 BTC was transferred to an unknown wallet, before being redistributed to other addresses. Another major CeFi hack, the WazirX hack, accounted for 42.8% of Q3 crypto losses, with nearly $240 million siphoned. An attacker breached their system, acquiring signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, enabling them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and drain the funds. Despite the DeFi sector achievements, some protocols were still heavily affected by hackers’ exploits including Radiant Capital. The DeFi firm lost over $55 million after a hacker gained access to their system using some malware, manipulating legitimate transaction approvals, and bypassing the protections of hardware wallets. Over $1.7 billion was lost to access control exploits in 2024 Over $2.3 billion has been drained by hackers from the crypto space in 2024. Both the DeFi and CeFi sectors were heavily hit by access control vulnerabilities. Access control exploits accounted for 75% of all crypto hack losses and nearly half of all DeFi losses, draining more than $1.7 billion. In addition, phishing scams drained over $600 million in 2024. Most of them were a combination of inclusive celebrity-endorsed rug pulls and presale scams. Hacken’s report even highlights that hacks and breaches across crypto and metaverse platforms persisted into 2024, due to weaknesses in private key management systems, poor security measures, single-signature vulnerabilities, and insecure private key backups.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is attempting to break from its downtrend, with some market watchers suggesting it is poised for a massive run in 2025. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Ethereum Key Levels To Reclaim With only a week left in 2024, several market watchers have started forecasting the crypto market’s potential performance for next year. Despite the recent pullbacks, several analysts have predicted a remarkable performance for Ethereum in 2025. The King of Altcoins has struggled to turn the $4,000 level into support. After breaking past this level earlier this month, ETH has been rejected from this price range three times. Its latest attempt occurred a week ago when Ethereum soared to $4,100 before retracing 7.3%. As Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $92,000, the second-largest crypto continued its freefall to the $3,100 support zone, reaching its lowest price in a month. Since then, Ethereum has hovered between $3,200 and $3,550 but failed to break past the price range’s higher zone for the past four days. However, the cryptocurrency has broken out of its downtrend line and is attempting to reclaim the $3,500 support. A crypto analyst noted that ETH appears to have broken and retested its one-week downtrend after reclaiming the $3,400 support. According to the post, a “clean breakout” of this downtrend could lead the cryptocurrency to a retest of higher levels. Ali Martinez highlighted that ETH’s next big support zone was between the $3,032 and $3,132 price range, with 4.85 million ETH bought by 3.69 million addresses. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s next big resistance wall is between $3,640 and $3,740, where over 2 million addresses bought around 4.3 million ETH. To Martinez, “a sustained close outside this no-trade zone will determine the direction of ETH’s trend.” Will ETH Follow 2021’s Performance? Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that “the first four months after U.S. elections are often highly bullish for ETH.” Per the chart, Ethereum registered massive gains in the first third of the year after the 2016 and 2020 US elections. In 2017, Ethereum started the year with a 31.92% increase in the first month, while it recorded a 78.51% surge in January 2021. In both years, ETH hit its peak monthly performances between March and April, seeing 214% and 44% returns in 2017 and 2021, respectively. If Ethereum repeats this historical performance, its price could surge above its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 in January and continue to climb during the rest of Q1. Crypto trader Immortal noted that Ethereum’s recent performance resembles its 2020-2021 price action. According to the chart, ETH saw a significant rise in early 2021 before consolidating in its new range. This was followed by a breakout and a massive drop to retest consolidation zone. Related Reading: Solana Recovery Momentum Set The Stage For $194 Resistance Breakout However, when ETH reclaimed its breakout levels in 2021, the cryptocurrency continued rallying toward its previous ATH of $4,300, eventually hitting its current ATH at the end of the year. The trader notes that ETH is retesting the consolidation range after last week’s dip, which signals that the cryptocurrency could soar in the coming weeks if it follows a similar path. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,501, a 6.3% increase in the last 24 hours.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 849,000 YouTube subscribers that if the Federal Reserve doesn’t bring back quantitative easing (QE), then ADA could continue to slip. “There’s also a chance [ADA] could go lower, especially if it follows what it did last cycle… If it were to drop 56%, that would actually put you below $0.60, which is right where it went last time… There’s always a chance that it comes back down to [the $0.357 price level], because [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell just says ‘no QE, continue on playing in the sandbox and the cryptoverse and we’ll give you QE sometime later.’ There’s a chance that happens.” Quantitative easing is when a government’s central bank purchases financial assets to increase the money supply and stimulate economic activity. Cowen goes on to say that ADA’s technical indicators, such as its 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and 21-week exponential moving average (EMA), are lining up with the theory that the crypto asset could see another sizeable dip. “The other thing to look at is the bull market support band. The bull market support band for ADA to Bitcoin – you can see that first of all, it wicked below it [in mid 2023] but it had a weekly close right around the 20-week SMA. [Earlier this year] it was just above the 21-week EMA, so I would also keep an eye on that. The 20-week SMA for ADA is around $0.56 [and] the 21-week EMA is around $0.67, so that would also correspond to [a price tag of around $0.53].” ADA is trading for $0.89 at time of writing, a 3% increase during the last day. On December 2nd, it was valued at $1.21.

This deal will help the company provide over 70 MW of power at its Lake Mariner facility. This shift from Bitcoin mining to AI will bring in more money and meet the growing need for energy-efficient infrastructure . TeraWulf Expands into AI Infrastructure TeraWulf Inc., mining company recently announced an expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. On December 23, the company revealed that it had signed agreements to lease data center space to Core42 which is an AI and cloud services provider. According to the deal, TeraWulf will provide over 70 megawatts (MW) of data center power at its Lake Mariner facility in Upstate New York. The infrastructure will also be rolled out in phases between the first and third quarters of 2025. These data centers will be set up to support Core42’s GPU clusters, using advanced Dell Integrated Rack Scalable Solutions. This partnership marks an important shift for TeraWulf, placing the company at the crossroads of two fast-growing industries: AI computing and Bitcoin mining. By leasing its data center space to Core42, TeraWulf is diversifying its sources of income and increasing its long-term earnings potential. The company has mainly focused on Bitcoin mining with sustainable operations and is now expanding into AI as a new business model. The increasing demand for efficient, scalable computing infrastructure in both AI and cryptocurrency sectors gives TeraWulf a great opportunity to benefit from these growing markets. TeraWulf’s CEO, Paul Prager , stressed how important this partnership is. He said it helps the company expand beyond Bitcoin mining and positions it as a leader in AI-driven computing. He pointed out that moving into AI will be a key factor for future growth, especially as the company continues to use mostly zero-carbon-powered infrastructure. This fits with TeraWulf’s larger goal of offering energy-efficient and scalable solutions to meet the growing demand for digital infrastructure. The data center lease agreement will provide TeraWulf with a steady and profitable income over time. The leases have two five-year renewal options and the chance to add 135 MW of power, which shows there is a lot of potential for growth. TeraWulf’s ability to quickly set up customized data centers also puts it in a good position to meet growing demand in both the AI and cryptocurrency sectors. TeraWulf’s move into AI comes at a time when Bitcoin mining is facing challenges. The cost of Bitcoin mining increases depending on several factors, such as electricity prices, hardware efficiency, and the mining space. Increase in Bitcoin Mining rates A recent report by CoinShares showed that the cost to mine a Bitcoin increased by 13%, reaching $55,950 in Q3 2024. This rise in costs has caused Bitcoin miners, including TeraWulf, to lose market share. Many are cutting back on mining to focus on AI projects, with some even buying Bitcoin directly instead of expanding their mining operations. TeraWulf’s move into AI-driven computing is part of a wider trend in the cryptocurrency mining industry, where companies are seeking new revenue sources due to rising costs. The company’s stock was affected by these challenges, with its price dropping 12.1% on December 23, reflecting broader market trends. However, TeraWulf has had a strong performance in 2024, with its stock price up by 152.6%, partly due to Bitcoin’s rise in value. As businesses and governments continue to seek AI solutions currently, the demand for this type of computing is expected to rise. TeraWulf’s focus on providing AI infrastructure powered mostly by zero-carbon energy gives it an edge in this market. TeraWulf’s partnership with Core42 is a smart move that sets the company up for long-term success in both AI and cryptocurrency. While it faces challenges in Bitcoin mining, its shift to AI-driven computing could help the company grow. With its focus on energy-efficient infrastructure, TeraWulf is well-placed to take advantage of the increasing demand for both AI and cryptocurrency services.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 01:34:00

This Revolutionary Layer 1 Presale is Redefining Blockchain Potential,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-xrp-this-revolutionary-layer-1-presale-is-redefining-blockchain-potential/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunities, and for those of us who’ve been watching for the next big thing, it’s clear: the blockchain space is evolving faster than ever. If you’ve skipped out on Ripple’s XRP, one of the industry’s well-known players, don’t worry – there’s a new project that’s capturing attention with its revolutionary technology and groundbreaking potential: Qubetics ($TICS) . In a landscape dominated by projects like XRP, which have brought significant changes to the world of cross-border payments, Qubetics is a fresh contender that’s setting out to redefine what a Layer 1 blockchain can do. With its presale already raising over $7.7 million and more than 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics ($TICS) is on track to offer some of the most promising returns in the space. But what makes Qubetics stand out against established players like Ripple? Let’s dive into the features, recent developments, and price predictions to find out why Qubetics might just be one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today . 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Scalability and Interoperability Qubetics is an emerging Layer 1 blockchain that is already capturing attention for its innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. Currently in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $7.7 million and sold more than 374 million tokens, with prices set to surge by 10% as it enters the 15th stage. At just $0.0377 per token, Qubetics represents a potential goldmine for early investors. Qubetics is unique in that it focuses not only on blockchain scalability but also on cross-chain interoperability, allowing seamless communication and transactions between various blockchain ecosystems. This is an area where Ripple and other established projects have had limitations. While Ripple focuses on payments, Qubetics is looking to create an all-encompassing Layer 1 blockchain solution that connects multiple blockchains , making it easier for developers and users to access various ecosystems without friction. Recently, Qubetics has been integrating with top blockchain players, laying the groundwork for a robust and interconnected ecosystem. This opens up possibilities for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise solutions that benefit from its speed, low fees, and high scalability. The ongoing presale has generated immense interest, and analysts are predicting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, providing investors with a 564% ROI. Decentralised VPN: Real-World Use Cases One of Qubetics’ standout applications is its Decentralised VPN . This feature offers a unique solution to individuals and businesses in Southeast Asia, where internet privacy and access restrictions are common concerns. Imagine a business in Indonesia wanting to protect its online operations from surveillance or a professional in Vietnam needing to access global websites without restrictions. With Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN, they can do so securely, bypassing local network restrictions and ensuring that their online presence remains anonymous. For businesses looking to securely engage with clients across borders, a Decentralised VPN built on Qubetics could offer peace of mind, knowing that their communications are encrypted and decentralised, free from the reach of central authorities or government interference. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Qubetics’ innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability sets it apart from other Layer 1 blockchains like Ripple. Its real-world applications, such as the Decentralised VPN, and its ongoing presale success make $TICS a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to secure long-term returns in the blockchain space. 2. Ripple (XRP): The Giant of Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP has been a dominant player in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space for years, particularly in the realm of cross-border payments. Its focus on providing a fast, secure, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking systems has earned it a strong reputation. Priced at around $0.438, XRP remains one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for anyone seeking exposure to the payments industry. Ripple has seen significant adoption in the financial services industry, with a growing list of banks and financial institutions integrating its technology to streamline cross-border transactions. XRP’s real-time settlement system, known as RippleNet, continues to expand, providing a faster alternative to traditional SWIFT transfers. However, despite its success in the financial sector, Ripple has faced regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States. The ongoing lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cast a shadow over XRP’s future. The outcome of this legal battle could have long-term implications on XRP’s price and regulatory status, potentially affecting its ability to continue growing as a global payments solution. Despite these challenges, XRP remains a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for those looking for a solid investment in the payments sector. Its strong partnerships, established use cases, and solid network make it a reliable choice, though investors must be mindful of the regulatory uncertainties. Why did Ripple (XRP) make it to this list? XRP’s continued dominance in the cross-border payments space and its solid market performance make it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today, especially for those seeking a trusted and well-established asset in the crypto market. However, potential regulatory risks mean that investors should keep a watchful eye on its future developments. Qubetics vs. Ripple for Short-Term and Long-Term Gains Let’s take a closer look at how an investment of $8,000 would perform in both Qubetics and Ripple. With Qubetics, the current price per $TICS token is $0.0377. If you were to invest $8,000 in Qubetics at the current presale price, you would receive approximately 212,870 tokens. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, giving you a 564% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $51,435. If $TICS continues to rise after the presale and reaches $1, your $8,000 investment would grow to $212,870, representing a 2,555% ROI. Even more optimistic projections suggest that $TICS could hit $5 after the mainnet launch, making your $8,000 investment worth $1.06 million—a 13,176% ROI. The explosive potential of Qubetics is hard to ignore. On the other hand, if you were to invest $8,000 in Ripple at the current price of $0.438 per token, you would be able to purchase approximately 18,270 XRP tokens. While XRP has shown steady growth, analysts predict more moderate returns, with a potential rise to $0.50 over the short term. This would offer a 14% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $9,120. Ripple’s price growth tends to be more stable, but its future is tied to regulatory outcomes, which could impact its short-term and long-term growth prospects . Why did Qubetics make it to this list? The potential for exponential returns from Qubetics in the presale phase makes it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors looking for high-growth opportunities. While Ripple remains a solid and reliable asset, Qubetics’ innovative features and rapid growth make it the more compelling option for short-term and long-term gains. What Are The Top Altcoins to Buy Today Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project that offers greater potential for growth compared to Ripple (XRP). While XRP continues to dominate the cross-border payments space, Qubetics provides a broader vision with its focus on scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. The Qubetics presale has already raised over $7.7 million, and with a unique application like the Decentralised VPN, it has positioned itself as one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors seeking high returns . If you missed the boat on XRP, now is the time to consider Qubetics. With explosive potential, an innovative approach, and a presale that’s already showing incredible growth, $TICS is the Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to capitalise on the future of blockchain technology. Don’t wait—secure your $TICS tokens today and watch your investment grow as this revolutionary project continues to unfold!

Celestia, for instance, is turning heads with its innovative Web3Bay project, promising to be the next big thing in decentralized e-commerce. Meanwhile, EOS is mounting a comeback, thanks to updates that enhance scalability and functionality, reigniting investor interest. Both projects are gaining traction, making them standout options in the hunt for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , quietly but confidently taking the crypto world by storm. Its presale has already sold over 374 million tokens, raising $7.7 million from more than 11,700 holders. But what sets Qubetics apart isn’t just the numbers—it’s the utility. With its game-changing wallet developed in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is tackling real-world crypto problems head-on. Let’s dive into how these projects are shaping up. Qubetics: The Wallet That Changes Everything Qubetics isn’t just about selling tokens; it’s about delivering real value. Its non-custodial multi chain wallet , created in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, is all about simplicity and security. Whether you’re paying for groceries or managing a diverse crypto portfolio, this wallet turns complex blockchain transactions into everyday ease. Let’s break it down: Say you’re a business owner. A customer pays you in Ethereum, but you need cash. No problem—Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism automatically swaps crypto into fiat at the point of sale. This means you’re shielded from crypto’s notorious volatility while still enjoying the benefits of digital payments. The presale numbers tell a story of trust. With over 374 million tokens sold and $7.7 million raised, Qubetics is clearly striking a chord with investors. At $0.0377 per token, the window to join is closing fast before the 10% price hike in the 15th stage this weekend. If you’re scouting the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics deserves a spot on your shortlist. Celestia: Building the Future of Web3 Celestia is on a mission to revolutionize the blockchain world with its modular approach. By separating consensus and data availability, Celestia allows developers to create highly customizable blockchains, which could pave the way for the next wave of Web3 applications. But here’s where it gets exciting: Web3Bay. Dubbed the “eBay of Web3,” this platform aims to transform decentralized e-commerce. Imagine buying and selling goods online with total transparency and no intermediaries skimming off the top. Celestia’s role in this project positions it as a leader in the Web3 revolution. Of course, no project is without risks. Celestia’s success hinges on developer adoption and the broader market’s appetite for Web3 solutions. But with its innovative tech and growing ecosystem, it’s a strong contender for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. EOS: A Comeback in the Making EOS has been through its fair share of ups and downs, but 2024 might just be its redemption arc. Known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, EOS is making a comeback with updates aimed at improving scalability and interoperability. These enhancements are designed to attract both developers and investors, positioning EOS as a viable alternative to Ethereum. Recent developments have included partnerships with several dApps and initiatives to improve community governance. The EOS Network Foundation has also ramped up efforts to increase adoption, focusing on sectors like gaming and DeFi. But can EOS reclaim its former glory? While the project shows promise, its path forward isn’t without challenges. That said, for those willing to bet on a comeback story, EOS remains one of the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. Conclusion In a market as dynamic as crypto, diversification is key. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking wallet and strong presale performance, offers practical solutions that set it apart. Celestia is redefining what’s possible with Web3 applications, and EOS is showing that comebacks are very much a thing. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, these three projects are worth a closer look. Qubetics stands out for its innovation and investor confidence, while Celestia and EOS bring unique strengths to the table. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Celestia (TIA), and EOS (EOS) as the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 .

Although the critical support above $2.10 has remained intact, indicating a strong buyer interest at below levels, the lack of any positive news that had the market in a state of euphoria in the first weeks after Trump’s election appears to be cooling down inflated expectations. The on-chain data, however, paints a different picture for XRP. According to Santiment data shared by Twitter/X crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales have accumulated 40 million XRP over the last 24 hours, suggesting that seasoned market participants are closely watching for the new breakout. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has added 3.08%, which may be a sign that the market is starting to react to renewed whale activity. Should the momentum continue, XRP may reclaim the recent highs at the $2.7 level. Currently, the main potential catalysts for the XRP price to watch for are RLUSD stablecoin listings, XRP spot ETF approval, and progress in the Ripple vs SEC case. RLUSD stablecoin went live on December 17 on XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, with initial listings on several exchanges and crypto platforms, including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA. Although it’s reasonable to assume that any attempt to corner the saturated stablecoin market will be met with fierce competition from established issuers Tether ($140 billion worth of USDT) and Circe ($43 billion worth of USDC), the use cases and utility brought by RLUSD are expected to drive demand for XRP as well. Considering that Ripple’s stablecoin is yet to be listed on Binance or Coinbase, any upcoming listings are likely to be treated by the investors as “buy the rumor, sell the news” events. After the successful debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, the crypto industry is anticipating approval for other Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, including XRP and SOL. Major players like WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have already filed for XRP ETFs and the leadership change at the SEC brought by Trump’s win makes the approval a much more likely thing than one would expect under Gary Gensler’s reign. Finally, the resolution of the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case also seems like a plausible outcome after Gensler’s resignation effective on Inauguration Day. With crypto-friendly Chair Paul Atkins at the helm, the new SEC is likely to drop non-fraud lawsuits, experts forecast. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.30, positioned at the level of the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) but holding above the 21-day EMA at $2.24. These indicators suggest a potential short-term bullish momentum, as the price is consolidating near its faster EMA and maintaining support above its medium-term trendline. Should the price successfully move away from its 9-day EMA, this would reliably signify the start of an upward trend. Conversely, a fall below the 21-day EMA would mean the inability to sustain momentum, leading XRP to potentially retest a $2.10 support. For context, the exponential moving average is a type of a moving average indicator that assigns more weight to the recent prices, making it more sensitive to the latest price changes when compared to a simple moving average. The 9 and 21-day EMAs are commonly used by traders to identify short-term trends. RLUSD gets listed on Bullish On Tuesday, Bullish, an institutional crypto exchange backed by tech mogul Peter Thiel, officially listed Ripple’s much-anticipated stablecoin. The exchange users will be able to trade it across seven pairs, namely RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, XRP/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD and SOL/RLUSD. Before Bullish, RLUSD also went live on Bitso, Independent Reserve, and Mercado Bitcoin. The stablecoin became available to the general public shortly after Ripple managed to secure approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement. According to CoinMarketCap , RLUSD currently has a market cap of $53 million, which places the stablecoin at the 2,978th place ranked by market capitalization. Over the past 24 hours, it generated a trading volume of $8.6 million, a 719% increase from the day before. RLUSD will be initially available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK, and Middle East regions, CoinDesk reported, quoting Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoin at Ripple. The token won’t be available for EU customers due to the lack of a necessary license to comply with the bloc's MiCAR regulations, although the company is actively exploring ways to enter the European market.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-25 01:49:10

A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson highlights that TON has moved into a favorable risk zone for accumulation, as indicated by the Normalized Risk Metric (NMR). This metric evaluates an asset’s price risk relative to historical data, providing a clearer picture of whether the current price levels are suitable for investment or if caution is warranted. Related Reading: Toncoin Consolidates: Could A Breakout Push TON Higher? Toncoin Current Market Outlook The NMR uses moving averages such as the 50-day and 374-day simple moving averages (SMA) along with logarithmic differences in price data to determine risk exposure. A normalized score ranging between 0 and 1 indicates the level of risk, with values closer to zero suggesting a lower chance of price decline. According to Wedson, TON’s current placement in the green zone signals reduced risk, making it an appealing opportunity for investors seeking long-term exposure to the asset. The analysis further suggests that while the medium and long-term risk profiles appear favorable, there remains a possibility for TON’s price to revisit historically significant support zones, often referred to as the “blue zone” on price heatmaps. Historically, these levels have served as price floors and accumulation points for investors expecting future price appreciation. Open Interest Decline and Market Volatility Trends Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, has added further context to Toncoin’s current market stance. According to his observations, TON’s Open Interest (OI) in the futures market has decreased to $141 million, marking the lowest level observed in the past nine months. Open Interest refers to the total value of outstanding futures contracts and is a key indicator of market sentiment and participation. A decline in Open Interest generally signals reduced market activity and lower volatility. While this trend is specific to TON, it reflects a broader pattern across the cryptocurrency market as the year comes to a close. Historically, periods of low Open Interest are often followed by significant price movements, either upward or downward, once liquidity returns to the market.

PEPE recently witnessed a dramatic 30% price drop after soaring to record highs, stirring questions about its future prospects. Concurrently, the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 points to a potential $10 value, sparking debates over the viability of its environmentally friendly blockchain to achieve sustained growth. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as a top crypto of 2024. Attracting significant attention, this project has amassed over $172 million in presale contributions and achieved an impressive 2,240% ROI since its inception. With its advanced hybrid blockchain and directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology, industry insiders are bullish about BDAG’s prospects to hit the $1 mark, positioning it as the prime crypto to get your hands on. PEPE Suffers a Sharp 30% Decline Post-Peak PEPE’s journey took a downturn recently, with a sharp 30% fall from its peak price of $0.0000293 on December 9. This significant dip has triggered skepticism regarding the sustainability of its initial explosive growth, suggesting it might have hit its peak. Technical analysis shows bearish trends, hinting at a possible further drop to $0.0000105 if crucial support levels fail. While there’s hope among some circles for a bounce back, others are bracing for a possible extended decline, advising caution among followers. Near Protocol’s 2025 Forecast: Climbing to $10 The outlook for Near Protocol has garnered mixed reviews from experts, some are optimistic about its future, while others caution against potential obstacles. Current predictions place its price at around $10.01 by 2025, fueled by its scalable and energy-efficient technology. Despite notable advancements in decentralized apps and its green tech credentials, Near Protocol contends with uncertainties from market dynamics and regulatory environments. Currently priced at $5.74, the pathway to the anticipated $10 remains fraught with unpredictability. As the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 suggests potential growth, savvy crypto watchers are advised to stay informed and assess the evolving market domain to pinpoint the most promising long-term investments. BlockDAG’s Sprint to $1: Is a 4200% ROI on the Horizon? BlockDAG has quickly become a powerhouse in the crypto sphere, amassing an impressive $172 million through its presale in mere months. A staggering 17.5 billion BDAG coins have been purchased, with early participants already reaping a 2,240% ROI as the price catapulted from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0234 in the latest Batch 26. This explosive growth has catapulted BlockDAG into the spotlight as the most buzzworthy crypto project currently. Enthusiasts and major players alike are drawn to its potential, especially with anticipated exchange listings that could push its value to the coveted $1 mark. Should BDAG reach this milestone, those holding Batch 26 could see a staggering 4200% ROI. Crypto analysts point to BlockDAG’s cutting-edge hybrid technology—merging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) efficiency with blockchain’s robust security—as a key driver of its presale success. This tech innovation enables faster transactions, greater scalability, and increased security, captivating a global audience and spurring a surge in demand for BDAG coins. Moreover, BlockDAG’s mining operations are thriving, generating over $6 million from the sales of more than 15,000 mining units. These units, known for their efficiency, are quickly being snapped up by those eager to maximize their BDAG earnings. As demand continues to rise, the current crypto presale for Batch 26 is poised to sell out soon, potentially driving prices higher. This presents a golden opportunity to get involved with BDAG at a still accessible price of $0.0234 per coin. Today’s Top Crypto Investment Opportunities In contrast, the PEPE price has recently fallen by 30%, stirring doubts about its future performance, while the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 anticipates a steady rise to $10, buoyed by its sustainable technology. Yet, it’s BlockDAG that’s leading the pack in the altcoin market with its remarkable achievements and substantial presale earnings. With breakthrough DAG technology and booming mining sales, BlockDAG is on a fast track to potentially hit the $1 threshold soon, which could unlock a 4200% ROI for current Batch 26 holders. For those scouting for the best crypto to buy, seizing BDAG coins now might be the smartest move in today’s volatile market.
