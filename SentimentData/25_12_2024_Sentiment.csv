Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Plunged To -0.221% In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst talked about the latest development in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. The “Coinbase Premium Index” refers to a metric that keeps track of the percentage difference between the BTC price on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means the cryptocurrency is trading at a higher rate on Coinbase than on Binance. Such a trend implies there is a higher buying pressure or a lower selling pressure present on the former as compared to the latter. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests that Binance users are participating in a higher amount of buying than Coinbase ones as they have pushed BTC to a higher value there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has seen a sharp decline into the negative region recently, meaning that sellers have appeared on Coinbase. Alongside this selling, the BTC price has also witnessed a decline, which would suggest the negative premium could be the source of it. The cryptocurrency has actually been following the indicator in this manner throughout the year, with its price going up and down alongside buying and selling shifts on Coinbase. The reason behind this relationship potentially lies in the fact that Coinbase is home to US-based institutional investors, who have had a significant presence in the market this year. The Coinbase Premium Index being red right now would naturally imply these giant investors are selling. Considering that BTC’s price has been following the metric, this would be a bearish signal for the asset. There exists another pattern, however, that could imply a different outcome for Bitcoin. As the quant has highlighted in the chart, the metric has seen a rebound whenever its value has gone to the -0.2% mark during the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals The explanation behind the pattern may be that it’s usually around this level of selling that new buyers show up and decide to accumulate on the dip, pushing the metric as well as the price up in the process. The current value of the indicator is sitting at -0.221%, so it’s possible that Bitcoin could be close to reaching a bottom, if it hasn’t already formed one. This would only be, of course, if the institutional investors think that the bull run is still on. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly went under the $93,000 level yesterday, but it seems the coin has found a rebound as its price is now trading around $94,100.

The exchange started when Hoskinson said, “Welcome to the new economy,” in a post about a YouTuber, Zara Dar, who left academia for OnlyFans. The AI bot then continued comparing Dar’s changing career path to the problem that the Cardano team is facing with the smart contract. The bot criticized Cardano’s progress, stating, “Bruh, you running Cardano like she running that PhD.” It also stated that Cardano has not fully developed working smart contracts. Hoskinson asked the bot questions and demanded it back up its claims. In response to the question, the bot changed the focus and said, “Your TPS is so low my response might take till 2025 to process.” Viral debate highlights AI bot’s nature The interaction attracted much attention online, and this was because Hoskinson may not have known that he was conversing with a bot. When a user in the community exposed RoastMaster9000 to be a bot, Hoskinson playfully likened his style to Captain Kirk of Star Trek. In different situations, Kirk, the main character of the series, usually beat AI using their own logic. The HOSKY meme coin account linked to the further replied, “Bot 2 Charles 0,” continuing the lighthearted banter. Hoskinson later admitted that he started wondering what the bot was capable of doing as soon as he realized it was an AI. “I have not seen a bot like this one,” he said. “I was naturally curious of how advanced it could be before it loops and deflects.” After the debate, Hoskinson revealed a project called Me-Box at Input Output Global (IOG), which is still in progress. This initiative is aimed at designing avatars of people for social communication. Hoskinson said he was curious about RoastMaster9000, which is the same as his interest in this project. Cardano (ADA) faces correction The price of Cardano’s ADA fluctuated considerably after a strong rally in November and early December. The cryptocurrency peaked at $1.30 in the first week of December before experiencing a pullback. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.9281 and has had a weekly loss of 13.71% and a 24-hour loss of 0.96%. ADA has a market capitalization of $ 32.64 billion and 35.12 billion tokens in circulation. Nevertheless, ADA retains the leading position in the market, and bearish pressure persists in the asset’s pricing. Crypto analyst Zen has noted ADA has a chance of a further bounce back in early 2025. Zen argues that the recent correction could boost the bull run. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez has compared the current ADA market chart to the 2020 cycle and found similarities that suggest future price increases. In addition to the price dynamics, Cardano’s ecosystem is still being developed. Charles Hoskinson recently complimented Ripple Labs’ Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, calling him “smart and passionate.” This has led to the speculation of a possible collaboration between the two blockchains.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 22:12:00

He expected to see “substantial growth” in the crypto ETF volume and inflows in 2025. OSL is allegedly Hong Kong’s largest custodian of local spot crypto ETFs with over 70% market share. Positive Sentiment to Influence Spot Crypto ETF Outlook Miller perceives that the sentiment surrounding the offering has improved significantly locally and globally. On this premise, he sees the future of spot crypto ETFs as brighter. Also, the OSL executive highlighted the incoming administration in the United States, citing that it will present a more favorable stance for the crypto industry. “The new U.S. administration’s favorable stance toward the crypto industry, coupled with interest rate cuts, has positively impacted global sentiment and cryptocurrency prices,” Miller stated. Hong Kong Launch Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs In April 2024, Hong Kong welcomed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs . Hong Kong became the first jurisdiction in Asia to issue a spot Ethereum ETF. Top firms like China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, and HashKey Capital Limited were endorsed by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This was about four months after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted BTC ETFs in America. On the debut trading day, Hong Kong crypto ETFs recorded a combined trading volume of approximately HK$87.5 million , equivalent to $11.2 million. US Spot Crypto ETFs Outperform its Hong Kong Counterparts The Bitcoin ETFs have up to 4,560 BTC, valued at approximately 444.6 million, as of Dec. 11, and the Ethereum funds hold up to 16,280 ETH ($59.6 million). Still, some entities evaluated the crypto ETFs as underwhelming. Compared to their US counterparts, they are grossly underperforming. The US spot crypto ETFs have a stellar record in terms of volume and inflows. These measures increased when pro-crypto Donald Trump won the election and was reelected as US President. As of early December, US spot Bitcoin ETFs already had a cumulative net inflow of over $34.06 billion, while its Ethereum counterparts saw over $1.78 billion.

The last two days of the week saw total outflows of $1 billion. The recent price declines led to a $17.7 billion drop in the total assets under management (AuM) for Digital Asset ETPs, which is likely influenced by the hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve’s dot plot published on Wednesday. Bitcoin Posts Strong Inflows While these outflows are significant, it is also important to note that the figures represent only 0.37% of total AuM and rank as the 13th largest single-day outflow in history, according to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report . In comparison, the largest single-day outflow occurred in mid-2022 when a $540 million outflow (2.3% of AuM) followed the Fed’s interest rate hike. Although Bitcoin saw some outflows during the week, it ended with net inflows of $375 million, indicating strong market sentiment. On the other hand, short-bitcoin products recorded only $0.4 million in inflows, reflecting a lack of significant interest from short-sellers. The “most dramatic” outflows came from multi-asset investment products, which saw a sharp decline of $121 million last week. On the altcoin front, XRP led the inflows with $8.8 million, followed by Horizen at $4.8 million and Polkadot at $1.9 million over the past week, showing a trend of investors favoring more selective opportunities. Chainlink, Cardano, and Litecoin also received modest inflows of $1.7 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum continued its positive streak and attracted $51 million, while Solana experienced outflows of $8.7 million during the same period. Switzerland Faces Largest Digital Asset Outflows The US continued to lead in digital asset inflows, drawing $567 million over the past week. Brazil and Australia followed with $16.6 million and $10.2 million in inflows, respectively, while other regions saw outflows. Topping the chart with the most outflows during the same period was Switzerland recording $95.1 million, followed by Germany and Canada with $74.7 million and $60.1 million. Outflows were also recorded in Sweden and Hong Kong, with $42.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively.

Whether you’re seasoned in the crypto space or just starting out, understanding which coin to pick is key. This guide looks into the top five cryptocurrencies poised to excel in 2025—BlockDAG (BDAG), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL). Each offers outstanding features and impressive ROI potential, making them essential considerations for your investment portfolio. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) Presale Surpasses $172 Million BlockDAG (BDAG) is a promising layer-1 blockchain noted for its unique DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) architecture, enhancing scalability and transaction speed while ensuring security. Its innovative hybrid consensus mechanism addresses many challenges faced by decentralized networks, distinguishing it from the conventional Proof-of-Work models. Currently in its presale stage, BlockDAG has successfully raised over $172 million, selling more than 17 billion BDAG coins. With a current price of $0.0234 in batch 26, early adopters have realized a staggering 2240% ROI. What sets BlockDAG apart? It offers smart contract capabilities, secure mining options, and optimized performance. From the user-friendly X1 mobile mining app to the robust X10, X30, and X100 miners, BlockDAG provides an environmentally friendly and efficient mining solution that is unmatched. Analysts believe BlockDAG will experience exponential growth by 2025, potentially surpassing many established cryptocurrencies. Its seamless integration with DeFi and NFT platforms bolsters its status as a top crypto pick for 2025. If innovation and growth potential are what you seek, BlockDAG deserves your attention. 2. Ripple (XRP): Enhancing Speed & Reducing Costs Previously known as Ripple, XRP facilitates transactions across various real-world currencies. Priced at approximately $2.18, XRP has seen notable value growth this year. XRP employs a consensus algorithm that accelerates transactions and reduces costs. The decentralized XRP Ledger supports cross-border payments with minimal fees through a trust-less mechanism. Ripple has also launched a stablecoin, RLUSD, boosting its trading volumes. With a design focused on energy efficiency, XRP stands out as a prime investment opportunity. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Leading in dApps & DeFi Ethereum is a well-established decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi). The recent shift to Ethereum 2.0, adopting Proof of Stake (PoS), has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency. Powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and augmented by Layer 2 solutions, Ethereum streamlines transactions and reduces costs. With the current trading price around $3,336, forecasts indicate ETH could reach new peaks by 2025, affirming its position as a top investment choice. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Fueling the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB), valued at $676.60, reflects a significant increase over the past year. BNB is integral to the Binance ecosystem, offering trading fee discounts, and powers the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that supports dApps and smart contracts. BNB’s utility spans DeFi applications, staking, and merchant payments. Currently nearing the $265.90 support level, analysts predict a rebound if this level holds, suggesting a strong future performance, making BNB a solid investment. 5. Solana (SOL): Fast Transactions with Low Fees Solana, priced at about $182.65 after a recent 23% drop, could see a turnaround if bullish momentum builds. Known for rapid transactions and low fees, Solana employs a unique Proof of History (PoH) system to enhance efficiency and scalability. With a vibrant ecosystem that includes dApps, NFTs, and DeFi projects, Solana’s ease of integration, eco-friendliness, and developer-friendly tools continue to attract users, making it an attractive crypto investment. Top Crypto to Buy Now As we approach 2025, the cryptocurrency market is ripe with opportunities. While Ethereum, Ripple, Binance Coin, and Solana are all strong contenders with proven track records and ongoing advancements, BlockDAG, with its groundbreaking technology and impressive ROI, captures the spotlight. By highlighting its growing ecosystem and technical advancements, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a dominant force in the competitive crypto market, making it a top crypto to buy for future gains.

Top coins poised for massive growth,https://crypto.news/which-crypto-will-explode-in-2025/,"With Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections, the cryptocurrency market has entered a strong growth phase, reigniting excitement across the space. A long-awaited milestone has been achieved with Bitcoin — its price has soared past the $106,000 mark. The crypto bull market is in full swing, leaving everyone wondering: what’s next? Which coin will explode in 2025? And which crypto has 1000x potential? Here’s a guide to the crypto coins to watch as we head into next year. Table of Contents The criteria for a crypto explosion Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Expert predictions for 2025 Risks and considerations The criteria for a crypto explosion With more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies out there today, only a small portion ever achieve real success. Why? The key lies in their utility, scalability, and adoption. Cryptos that succeed often focus on offering something useful, whether that’s speeding up transactions, cutting down on fees, or boosting privacy. For instance, projects that support decentralized finance or enable smart contracts often gain traction due to their innovative applications. You might also like: What is DeFi? Understanding Decentralized Finance and its uses A crypto’s success depends heavily on scalability — blockchains that can process lots of transactions without slowing down or hiking up costs stand out. This reliability makes them more attractive as demand for seamless digital transactions grows. Strong community support, solid partnerships, and strategic market positioning drive adoption, bolstered by a transparent and experienced development team. Cryptos that are decentralized attract users looking for security, privacy, and control, as no single entity has all the power. This openness builds trust and transparency. Centralized cryptos, on the other hand, often spark concerns about control and transparency since one entity holds the reins. Many users prefer decentralization for its autonomy and lower risk of manipulation. Without these foundational elements, many cryptocurrencies simply fail to stand out in the increasingly crowded market. Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Which cryptocurrency will explode in 2025? As the market evolves, certain coins show immense potential for rapid growth. Here are some crypto coins to watch. Ethereum Ethereum 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is clear, with its key role in powering decentralized applications and smart contracts. With the rise of DeFi and NFTs , Ethereum ( ETH ) is well-positioned to retain its dominant position. After transitioning to Ethereum 2.0 in 2022, the network’s scalability and energy efficiency have improved, allowing it to handle more transactions without compromising security. Looking ahead, the Pectra upgrade planned for 2025 will enhance Ethereum’s scalability even further, enabling it to process more transactions and introducing innovative features like social recovery for wallet access. This is expected to make Ethereum even more robust, positioning it for future growth in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Solana Solana 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Solana ( SOL ) continues to make waves in the blockchain space, standing out for its impressive transaction speed and low fees, which are attracting developers across various industries. The network’s growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force. While it has faced some network issues in the past, Solana’s ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem. With its unique ability to process transactions quickly and an expanding user base, Solana is well-positioned for continued success in 2025​. Chainlink Chainlink 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Chainlink ( LINK ) is a decentralized oracle network that plays a crucial role in connecting blockchains with real-world data. Its ability to securely transmit external information to smart contracts makes it invaluable to the blockchain ecosystem. With expanding partnerships and increasing use in DeFi and smart contracts, Chainlink is on a strong growth trajectory. As the demand for blockchain-based data services continues to rise, Chainlink is well-positioned to see significant upside potential. Chainlink’s growing adoption, including partnerships with major companies like Google Cloud, SWIFT, and the World Economic Forum, showcases its increasing importance. As demand for decentralized data services grows, Chainlink’s unique position in blockchain infrastructure positions it for significant growth, especially as blockchain technology expands into more industries. Expert predictions for 2025 As 2025 approaches, experts present a range of predictions for Ethereum, highlighting its critical role in the evolving cryptocurrency space. Some foresee ETH breaking new records, possibly surpassing $5,000, fueled by growing demand and its limited supply dynamics. Other projections are more optimistic, envisioning ETH prices potentially crossing $10,000, fueled by institutional interest and strong market fundamentals. Predictions for Chainlink’s performance in 2025 vary, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Analysts suggest that LINK could climb to a range of $30.69 to $38.26 by year-end, driven by growing adoption and ongoing technological advancements. Others, like Nick Petisce, suggest a more optimistic outlook, proposing that LINK could soar to $2,000-$6,000 within the next 3-5 years, driven by the adoption of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and partnerships with major financial institutions. Similarly, Solana has garnered attention for its high transaction speeds and low fees, attracting developers across various industries. While specific 2025 price predictions for SOL are less prevalent, the network’s growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force in the blockchain space. Ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem, positioning Solana for continued success in the coming years.

Even strong projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are not exempt from market turbulence or external disruptions like regulatory crackdowns. Price volatility can lead to significant losses if you’re not prepared. Predictions from experts offer guidance but don’t guarantee outcomes. Additionally, the crypto space often attracts fraudulent schemes, making due diligence crucial. Take time to analyze each coin’s fundamentals, consider its long-term potential, and never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

38074272,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322348,1735080979,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38074272.jpeg,Argentina Freezes $3.5M USDT Linked to Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme: Report,https://cryptonews.com/news/argentina-freezes-3-5m-usdt-linked-to-rainbowex-ponzi-scheme-report/,"Argentine authorities have taken decisive action against Rainbowex, an alleged Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors, primarily in Buenos Aires’ San Pedro region. A judicial order compelled Tether, the issuer of USDT, to freeze approximately $3.5 million in cryptocurrency linked to the platform on December 24. The investigation into Rainbowex has led to multiple raids, arrests, and international warrants. Source: iProup Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme Busted: How $3.5M USDT Was Frozen Following Multiple Arrests and Raids According to the source close to the case , the legal action to freeze Rainbowex’s digital assets follows months of intensive investigation and enforcement operations. Argentine law enforcement agencies conducted over 15 raids nationwide, targeting locations associated with Rainbowex and its operators. As a result, four individuals, including Luis Pardo, Maximiliano Braga, Facundo Villalba, Mariano Diez, and Andrés Desanzo, were apprehended. An additional arrest warrant was issued for Alexis Pan, who remains at large. The authorities’ efforts also extended beyond Argentina, as the Buenos Aires Justice Department coordinated with Interpol to issue red notices for two Malaysian nationals believed to be key figures behind the scheme. The raids yielded important evidence of the scheme’s operations, including the seizure of 30 million pesos (worth approximately $1.48M) in cash, distributed across various currencies such as dollars, yuan, and euros. This crypto seizure is yet one of the biggest this year. Investigations revealed that Rainbowex posed as a legitimate crypto investment platform, promising substantial returns. However, investors began reporting issues when they attempted to withdraw their funds, which ultimately exposed the platform as a fraudulent closed-loop system disconnected from public blockchains. The Role of Tether and the Controversy of USDT Blacklisting It was noted that Tether’s ability to blacklist wallets implicated in illicit activities helped largely in the asset freeze process. Following a court order, Tether disabled transactions for the wallet holding Rainbowex’s USDT, which effectively froze all the funds. Rodrigo Mansilla, a blockchain expert, explained that the blacklisting process renders any transaction—whether sending or receiving USDT—impossible once a wallet is flagged. This functionality, embedded in the USDT smart contract, checks the wallet’s status before permitting transactions. If the address is blacklisted, the contract sets a boolean value to “false,” blocking any movement of assets. While this mechanism is lauded as a critical tool for law enforcement, it has sparked debate over the decentralization of stablecoins. “This centralized blocking capability calls into question the supposed decentralization of USDT, even when stored on a decentralized blockchain,” Mansilla expressed. Mansilla pointed out that although USDT operates on decentralized blockchains, Tether’s ability to control it centrally contradicts the core principles of decentralization. Maximiliano Firtman, a computer specialist, shared a similar sentiment on the blacklisting process, noting that Tether’s ability to freeze assets indefinitely raises concerns about the potential for permanent loss of funds. However, Firtman also indicated that Tether could mint new tokens to replace the frozen USDT and transfer them to a wallet designated by the judiciary, potentially mitigating the impact on victims. The collaboration between public authorities and the private sector was instrumental in advancing the investigation. Lemon exchange, alongside blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Qlue, provided technical expertise and access to critical data. Judicial sources also confirmed that these companies shared extensive database information, which enabled authorities to track Rainbowex’s financial movements and build a robust case. An earlier report in October revealed that up to 20,000 people had reportedly invested in a fraudulent USDT-themed crypto scheme from RainbowEx . The scheme was promoted by actors and an enigmatic figure called “La China.” The post Argentina Freezes $3.5M USDT Linked to Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Argentina|Ponzi Scheme|USDT stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-24 22:56:19

On-chain metrics indicate a notable shift in exchange activity, with Tether (USDT) seeing significant outflows while Bitcoin (BTC) inflows into exchanges remain elevated. This trend suggests a potential “imbalance” in market dynamics, where selling pressure could lead to further price corrections in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Fueling Potential Dip – $90K Support Crucial Level To Hold Spot Market Trends and Selling Pressure Signal Possible Downturn According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Onatt, more than 15,000 BTC have been observed moving into exchanges, a metric typically associated with an increased likelihood of sell-offs. Simultaneously, Tether outflows imply a reduction in liquidity within these exchanges. Tether Outflows and Bitcoin Inflows Signal Short-Term Weakness “Significant amounts of Tether (USDT) are exiting exchanges, and a large inflow of Bitcoin (BTC) (>15K) has been observed entering exchanges.” – By @tutunculeronat Link 👇https://t.co/NFCLi7EpiI pic.twitter.com/6lUyTiEdNi — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 24, 2024 Historically, such movements have been linked to short-term price declines, as traders and institutional investors reposition their portfolios amid market volatility. However, Onatt noted that while these indicators suggest short-term downside risk, there appears to be no significant macroeconomic catalyst to drive a prolonged bearish trend. The analyst particularly wrote: This combination of factors may indicate a potential for further short-term downside in Bitcoin’s price. However, from a macroeconomic perspective, there doesn’t appear to be a catalyst that would necessitate a prolonged bearish trend after this short-term correction. Key Indicators Suggest Mixed Signals in the Bitcoin Market TraderOasis, another analyst, highlighted additional metrics influencing Bitcoin’s price behavior. One key observation focused on the Coinbase Premium Index, which failed to follow Bitcoin’s upward movement during its last price surge. Oasis noted: As a result, the price retreated. We are now in negative territory. I expect a break in the market for the continuation of the rise. Notably, this disconnect indicates a lack of strong buying activity from US-based investors, often considered a significant driver of Bitcoin’s upward momentum. The analyst also noted that the funding rates have started to decline while open interest levels have been rising. Falling funding rates coupled with rising open interest typically indicate that traders are opening more short positions. This pattern suggests bearish sentiment in the derivatives market, with traders expecting a continuation of the downward trend or, at best, a period of sideways movement.

According to a new report from the state-controlled TASS, the complete ban will affect regions including Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, and the recently annexed territories of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The prohibition is reported to remain in effect until March 15, 2031. In addition, three Siberian regions — Irkutsk, Buryatia and Zabaikalsky — will face seasonal mining restrictions during peak energy consumption periods. These limitations will run from January to mid-March 2025, expanding to November through March in subsequent years. The measures follow cryptocurrency mining legislation signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2024, aimed at preventing power shortages and blackouts. The energy-intensive nature of proof-of-work crypto mining has reportedly strained Russia’s power grid, particularly in regions with limited infrastructure, according to TASS. Both individual miners and mining pools must cease operations during restricted periods, marking Russia’s most aggressive step yet to address its energy challenges while maintaining economic stability. Earlier this year, Bitcoin ( BTC ) miners based in Russia mined billions of dollars worth of the top crypto asset by market cap last year.

Additionally, a number of myths are often associated with the technology, which may hamper adoption in the future. Forrester Report Highlights Enterprise Blockchain Myths Forrester Research released a new report detailing the most common blockchain myths from 2014 until present day. Martha Bennett, VP and Principal Analyst at Forrester, told Cryptonews that she compiled the list. She explained that the findings were based on insights and observations gained from research and work with clients on the topic of enterprise blockchain over the years. Bennett shared that she started her research in mid-2014 and hasn’t stopped since. “Over the years key themes associated with blockchain technology have emerged that were frequently taken at surface value by IT and business teams in enterprises,” she said. “I spent lots of time explaining to clients (and non-clients, for that matter) what was myth and what was reality.” Although blockchain has matured greatly over the years, Bennett believes that the myths listed below continue to persist – here’s why: The Blockchain Exists The Forrester report notes that phrases such as “the blockchain will address that” or “putting something on the blockchain” create confusion. This is why it’s worth stressing that the blockchain doesn’t actually “exist.” The report states that “blockchain is an architectural principle that features certain characteristics.” It also states that the underlying concept of blockchain can be realized differently. For instance, there are dozens of public, permissionless blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A wide variety of open-source and proprietary protocols are also available to build permissioned networks. In addition, there are semi-public and hybrid networks whose governance models offer a blend of permissioned and permissionless functions. “Many software offerings aren’t blockchains by any stretch of the imagination because they don’t use blocks,” the report notes. “However, these offerings label themselves as such.” Blockchains Disintermediate And Trusted Third Parties Are No Longer Needed The second myth is that blockchain networks won’t ever fully disintermediate. While blockchain networks support the direct transfer of value between two parties, third parties are still needed for enterprise blockchain use cases. “The only way to cut out third parties altogether is for consumers or businesses to self-custody their wallets and interact with a blockchain directly, which is not a realistic proposition for mainstream business relationships,” the report states. “Even in scenarios where ecosystem partners deal directly with each other at the expense of existing third parties, it doesn’t mean third parties are no longer part of the mix.” The document adds that cryptocurrency use cases rely on third parties, such as wallet providers, exchanges, and custody services. Blockchains Are Decentralized Third on the list of myths is that blockchains are decentralized. However, decentralization is more complex than it may seem. decentralization is THE single most important tenet in crypto. without it, we’re really no different to traditional financial systems. — TINA (@thetinaverse) December 23, 2024 “Even the public Bitcoin and Ethereum networks aren’t completely decentralized,” the report states. “On the contrary, miners and core developers in effect exercise a form of central control, and those small groups aren’t accountable to anybody.” Findings also state that elements of centralization are present in cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (Dapps) . As a result, it’s noted that the term “decentralization theater” has become popular for describing networks or applications that claim to be decentralized but aren’t. Blockchains Are Trustless While a blockchain network can facilitate the exchange of information between people or entities that do not know or trust each other, that doesn’t mean the technology is entirely trustless. According to the report, participants still trust the functioning of these networks. For example, participants need to trust the mathematics and cryptography, along with the network’s code. Users also need to trust those who effectively control the respective networks, such as those with the resources to add blocks to the chain and the developers who can modify the core code. Blockchains Are Immutable A key characteristic of a blockchain network is immutability, yet the report explains that this isn’t always the case and notes that for enterprises, immutability isn’t always desirable. According to the report, changes can be made to the blockchain. “One is to recompute the chain, either in its entirety or to the point before an undesirable event occurred; this erases and recreates history,” the report states. “The other is to fork the chain, which preserves historical code and transactions but means the software now works differently, and ownership may have been reassigned.” Blockchains Are Inherently More Secure The report also points out that blockchains may not be more secure unless these features are designed into the network . For instance, in some cases, participants will have access to credentials to access a network. This creates a security vulnerability. Even networks with multiple nodes are susceptible to attacks. Nodes are the backbone of blockchain. Verifying transactions, ensuring security, and powering decentralization—every node is a piece of freedom in Web3. Want to truly support the crypto revolution? Run a node and join the movement. #Blockchain #Crypto #Decentralization pic.twitter.com/A4GFTbbGGS — Oleksandr Bagnyuk (@AlexBagnyuk) December 15, 2024 “The more nodes there are in the network, the more choices there are for somebody with evil intent to find one that’s less well protected,” the report states. Blockchains Are “Truth Machines” While blockchains may be viewed as single sources of truth, malicious actors can still take over. The report points out that if somebody registers property ownership, the system can’t tell whether this is really the rightful owner. “Similarly, it can’t tell whether the consent for data usage has been obtained legitimately,” the report states. “Sensor data can be manipulated, either by tampering with the sensor itself or by intercepting the data stream.” Blockchains Automatically Improve Data Quality Although blockchain networks work well for ensuring data integrity, the report highlights that data quality issues must be addressed before information is written on the blockchain. The same applies to data that triggers a smart contract. “If nobody establishes and ensures the required data quality standards before the network launches or data is written to a blockchain-supported back end in a centrally controlled service, the shortcoming will be obvious very soon,” the report notes. Transparency Can Only Be Good All transactions on the blockchain are transparent, but this isn’t always beneficial for enterprises. Given this, the report notes that confidentiality is the biggest technical challenge developers need to resolve. Although progress has been made around confidentiality-preserving mechanisms, these remain complex. “Algorithmic zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) — aren’t ready for enterprise prime time,” the report states. S mart Contracts Will Make Lawyers Redundant The myth that smart contracts will replace lawyers is addressed as myth number 10. While smart contracts are able to automate certain processes , the report notes that “code is not law.” “Even if participants in a network wish to abide by the results of smart contract execution, they still need a separate legal agreement that states as much and captures other standard contractual principles,” the report states. Build It, And They Will Come As blockchain technology matures, enterprises are thought to be more likely to adopt solutions. This may not be the case, though. The report notes that between June 2022 and January 2024, many enterprise blockchain initiatives ended in failure. Fortunately, decision-makers who want to avoid a similar fate are now realizing key lessons. According to the report, enterprises must consider ecosystem partners’ and customers’ needs and wants. Businesses using blockchain solutions should not expect a commercial model to develop organically. Finally, enterprises should conduct in-depth research on blockchain software before implementing a solution. The report warns that large businesses must proceed carefully when using blockchain technology. “A key contributor to the failure of TradeLens was Maersk’s dominant position in the market. Even if everything else had been just so (which it wasn’t), Maersk’s sheer size concerned smaller ecosystem participants, which feared Maersk would learn too much about them, while Maersk’s major competitors weren’t that interested in becoming part of a Maersk-led network, despite IBM’s participation,” the report states.

Table of Contents XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently Cardano’s rise amid market shifts Lightchain AI to transform blockchain technology Why Lightchain AI could steal the spotlight Tokenomics and roadmap A seasoned trader has declared XRP’s price is now firmly anchored above $1, signaling strong momentum for the token. While XRP celebrates this milestone, the spotlight is shifting toward Cardano (ADA) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , two projects poised for explosive growth. Cardano’s consistent development and robust ecosystem continue to attract attention, but it’s Lightchain AI, priced at just $0.003 during its presale, that’s stealing headlines. With unique technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), LCAI is redefining blockchain and AI, offering unmatched growth potential. XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently XRP, the cryptocurrency issued by Ripple, recently surged above the $1 mark. This significant increase has been attributed to several factors: Regulatory developments – The New York Department of Financial Services approved Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, pegged to the U.S. dollar. This approval is expected to enhance XRP’s value and utility within Ripple’s digital payments platform. Political climate – The election of President Donald Trump has led to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Trump’s appointment of Paul Atkins, known for his supportive stance on cryptocurrencies, as SEC head may ease previous legal challenges faced by Ripple. Analysts are optimistic about XRP’s future, with some predicting that it could reach a price range of $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025. However, investors should remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Cardano’s rise amid market shifts In the middle of new market changes, Cardano (ADA) has shown great rise. Over the last four days ADA’s price jumped by 32%, making its market value $14.932 billion and firming it as ninth-largest coin by market value. This big rise shows more interest and trust in Cardano from investors. Additionally, money rates for Cardano have gotten a clear lift. This shows more hope among traders. People are happy to pay extra for long bets, which m͏eans they think prices will go up some more. These changes show Cardano’s ability to take advantage of market speed and make itself a strong player in the changing crypto world.

At the heart of its technology lies the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which is set to redefine blockchain validation. Unlike traditional methods like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI will incentivize nodes to perform meaningful AI computations, such as model training and inference. This will not only enhance scalability and security but also reduce energy consumption, making Lightchain AI a sustainable alternative for modern blockchain applications. Also central to its technological breakthrough is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a state-of-the-art computational layer optimized for AI workloads. The AIVM will enable developers to deploy advanced, data-driven dApps with high efficiency. Supporting interoperability with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, the AIVM will ensure smooth integration of existing models into Lightchain AI’s ecosystem. Through these innovations, Lightchain AI will set a new benchmark for decentralized intelligence, fostering a transparent, inclusive, and high-performance blockchain environment. Lightchain AI’s approach to decentralization will also tackle systemic issues like AI bias and centralized control. By incorporating federated learning and decentralized governance, the platform will empower community-driven decision-making and ensure fairness in AI applications. With its presale already in Stage 8, raising over $4.16 million, Lightchain AI is not just a technological platform — it’s a revolution poised to reshape the blockchain landscape.

Chosun Ilbo reported that progress has stalled on a deal that would s ee Megazone, a cloud service provider, take control of GOPAX. The latter is one of South Korea’s five fiat-trading crypto exchanges. The deal is complicated by the fact that GOPAX is currently majority-owned by the global crypto exchange giant Binance .

And industry sources have come to the conclusion that Megazone has effectively given up on the acquisition deal.” A further wrinkle comes in the form of GOPAX’s debt to creditors as a result of the failure of its GOPAY crypto staking services.

GOPAX has told creditors that it wants to repay unpaid balances “in cash based on the price at the time of the collapse.” But disgruntled creditors say they want their Bitcoin back “as-is.” Chosun wrote that if Megazone “pulls out of the deal, the exchange will not meet financial authorities’ demands. And it explained: “Not only is it extremely unlikely that a new buyer will emerge, but it is also obvious that Gopax’s debt will be a hindrance during takeover negotiations.” Did you know Korea has over 100,000 coffee shops for a population of just 51 million?

The firm received the all-clear, but the newspaper wrote: “If the authorities do not accept the renwal application, citing the change in major shareholders as a problem, GOPAX will have to go through the process of closing down. And then repaying its debts will become even more difficult.” Chosun quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying: “GOPAX has fulfilled all the legal requirements it could.

38074275,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322547,1735083470,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38074275.jpeg,Sui (SUI) Price Analysis – Break Above $5.0 Imminent as On-chain Activity Booms,https://cryptonews.com/news/sui-sui-price-analysis-break-above-5-0-imminent-as-on-chain-activity-booms/,"The Sui (SUI) bulls remain very much in control on the eve of Christmas Day 2024, with the price last around $4.60, only just below the record highs it hit near $5.0 earlier in the month. SUI continues to find strong support upon retests of its major moving averages, including an impressive bounce last week from the 50DMA. That suggests appetite to buy the dip remains elevated, and pressure could be building for an explosive pop above the $5.0 level in the coming weeks. The bullish Sui price action shouldn’t come as a surprise against the backdrop of booming on-chain activity, souring trading volumes, and a fundamental backdrop that remain a strong tailwind for crypto markets going into 2025. Per DeFi Llama , the USD value of crypto locked in smart contracts on the Sui blockchain is at record highs near $1.8 billion, on-chain volumes are routinely clocking in in the $400 million to $600 million range, and perp volumes are trending back towards their highest levels of the year. Sui’s official X page recently tweeted a summary of the blockchain’s bumper year of growth. 2024 was so awesome for the Sui community, words just aren't enough… …so we decided to use numbers! And trust us, the numbers in this recap are truly impressive pic.twitter.com/W8DwuRYHeh — Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 23, 2024 Meanwhile, though Fed caused a stir in risk assets when it signaled fewer rate cuts in 2025 than the market had been anticipating last week, hopes remain high that the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration and Congress is going to usher in a new golden era for the crypto industry and markets in the US, accelerating global adoption. Bitcoin will steal most of the headlines in 2025 given the potential establishment of a US Bitcoin strategic reserve . However, high performing chains like Sui are also primed to explode. Schwab says #Bitcoin could hit $500K–$1M when Trump establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/3cArfgRYTU — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 6, 2024 Where Next for the Sui (SUI) Price? All that being said, a near-term breakout to the north of $5.0 seems highly likely for the Sui price. But with Sui already in a phase of price discovery, there aren’t too many easily identifiable price targets for the crypto. A 2x rally to $10 is certainly a possibility. But considering Sui’s current market cap of around $46 billion fully diluted ($13.5 billion circulating), much greater than 2x gains could be in store for the crypto. Sui is currently proving itself as one of the best performing layer-1 protocols in the game, and there is scope for significant catch up to its larger rivals like Solana and Ethereum. Solana’s fully diluted market cap was last around $116 billion, while Ethereum’s was last $420 billion, with both also likely to expand significantly in 2025. Could Sui also reach a fully diluted valuation in the hundreds of billions this cycle? It’s certainly a possibility, assuming its chain continues to lead in terms of web3 adoption, as is currently the case. A Sui price in the $20 range becomes a realistic target with if assumptions hold. That means its a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Of course, crypto investors would be best served by spreading their portfolio across a few high-potential coins. Bitcoin could still post 2x gains next year, or even more if strategic reserves gain ground. Other leading tokens like Ethereum and Solana are also likely to perform very well. But Sui is certainly a great addition to any investor’s crypto portfolio.

Ripple (XRP) has reclaimed its bullish momentum, surging past key resistance levels and positioning itself for a strong breakout. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT), despite showing technical promise, struggles to break free from its bearish grip, leaving traders and analysts divided on its immediate future. Amid this dynamic landscape, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves as a groundbreaking presale project. Backed by a high-profile partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is redefining the blockchain wallet ecosystem and expanding into untapped territories like Real World Asset Tokenisation. With over 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly becoming a hot topic in crypto circles. Let’s dive deeper into these three standout projects—Qubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot—to understand why they’re among the best crypto to join this week and how each is carving its niche in the blockchain ecosystem. Qubetics: A Revolution in Blockchain Utility The buzz around Qubetics is palpable, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it aims to bridge real-world applications with blockchain innovation. The recent partnership with SWFT Blockchain has turbocharged its wallet features, offering lightning-fast cross-chain swaps and unmatched security. But the star of the show is its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Game-Changer Imagine a system where property, art, or even corporate bonds can be tokenised and traded on a decentralised platform. That’s precisely what Qubetics is bringing to the table. With this feature, businesses and individuals can turn tangible assets into digital tokens, unlocking liquidity and facilitating seamless global transactions. Picture a small business in Argentina seeking to expand operations. By tokenising a valuable piece of equipment or real estate, the business can attract international investors without the hurdles of traditional finance . Similarly, a professional in Brazil could use Qubetics to diversify their portfolio, owning fractional shares in assets previously out of reach. For individuals, the possibilities are equally exciting. A young entrepreneur in Chile could tokenise intellectual property, securing funding for a startup. This marketplace isn’t just a tool—it’s a paradigm shift, breaking barriers and democratising access to investment opportunities. Why Qubetics Shines Bright What makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to join this week is its ambitious vision paired with tangible solutions. It’s not just about hype; it’s about delivering real-world impact . With 374 million tokens already sold and over $7.7 million raised, the presale’s momentum is hard to ignore. Ripple: Riding the Bullish Wave Ripple, known for its focus on cross-border payments, has always been a strong player in the crypto world. Recently, XRP’s price action has reignited excitement, with the token stabilizing above $2.10 and setting sights on breaking the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP’s resurgence can be attributed to several factors. First, its stronghold in the financial sector, with partnerships spanning major banks and payment processors, reinforces its utility. Recent technical analysis reveals a bullish breakout above $2.20, with XRP trading at $2.25 and targeting the $2.30 resistance. This movement aligns with broader market trends, showcasing XRP’s resilience amid Bitcoin and Ethereum’s fluctuations. Analysts are optimistic that clearing the $2.30 hurdle could push XRP toward $2.50 or higher, reaffirming its relevance in the crypto landscape. Why Ripple Stands Out XRP’s focus on real-world applications, particularly in cross-border remittances, makes it an enduring favourite. Its ability to weather market volatility and emerge stronger underscores its potential as one of the best crypto to join this week. With technical and institutional support, Ripple is well-positioned for sustained growth. Polkadot: A Sleeping Giant? Polkadot has long been hailed for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. However, its recent price movements have left traders scratching their heads. Despite breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, DOT remains in bearish territory, currently trading at $6.83. Mixed Signals in the Market Polkadot’s technical indicators present a mixed bag. On the one hand, the falling wedge breakout suggests potential for a bullish reversal. On the other hand, resistance at $10.88 looms large, making traders wary. Social sentiment around Polkadot is growing, but it hasn’t translated into sustained upward momentum yet. One bright spot is the increased activity in Polkadot’s derivatives market, with long positions slightly outpacing shorts. This indicates some confidence among traders, but the road to a significant rally remains uncertain. Why Polkadot is Worth Watching While Polkadot may not be on an immediate upward trajectory, its robust ecosystem and focus on scalability make it a project with long-term potential. For those looking for diversification in their crypto portfolios, Polkadot remains a project to monitor closely. Understanding Real World Asset Tokenisation with Qubetics Asset tokenisation is not just a buzzword—it’s the future of finance. By converting physical assets into digital tokens, Qubetics enables seamless trading, increased liquidity, and broader access to investment opportunities. How It Works Qubetics’ platform uses blockchain to create digital representations of assets, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. These tokens can be traded globally, bypassing traditional financial systems and their associated costs. Why It Matters This technology opens up new avenues for Latin American countries, where financial systems can be restrictive or volatile. Whether it’s securing loans, attracting foreign investment, or participating in global markets, tokenisation empowers individuals and businesses . The Final Thoughts Based on our research, Qubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot each bring unique value to the table. Qubetics stands out with its ambitious vision and real-world solutions, particularly its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Ripple’s resurgence highlights its resilience and utility, making it a strong contender in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Polkadot’s innovative approach to interoperability positions it as a long-term bet despite its current challenges. If you’re looking for the best crypto to join this week, Qubetics’ ongoing presale is an opportunity worth exploring. With its focus on groundbreaking technology and real-world applications, it’s poised to redefine the blockchain landscape. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey.

Currently trading around $0.30, the Dogecoin price has seen a sharp drop of 25% over the past week, worrying traders and investors as it struggles to hold onto important support levels. This drop raises concerns about a possible further decline. Crypto trader Kevin predicted on November 13 that the Dogecoin price would fall to between $0.26 and $0.28, and this prediction has now come true. Despite facing criticism, he believes that tjw Dogecoin price will eventually recover and aim for new highs, but it may have to go through a significant drop first. Kevin noted that the Dogecoin price is experiencing a typical pullback in a bull market after a “golden cross,” which usually signals future price increases. He highlighted that previous drops have been about 50%, and a 45% pullback could establish key support, keeping the uptrend intact. However, the Dogecoin price closing below $0.26 could signal serious market issues, while the current decline is viewed as normal. RCOF Presale: Invest Now, Reap Huge Rewards While the Dogecoin price is losing steam, RCO Finance is emerging as a frontrunner with its token presale. Projections suggest an astounding 20,000% surge in token value by the first quarter of 2025, attracting a growing number of investors eager to acquire RCOF presale tokens.

However, the token price is expected to increase to $0.2142 when it enters the Bonus Round, and it could rise even more as it approaches its anticipated listing price of between $0.4 and $0.6.

He still holds a lot of ETH and believes in its future. Experts are hopeful that Ethereum’s price will rise again. Justin Sun sold ETH, The rumor Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX), rumors about him claiming that he sold a large amount of his Ethereum (ETH). These rumors have started after data showed huge transfers from wallets linked to him. The timing of these transfers also combined with Ethereum’s recent drop in price which made people think Sun was selling his ETH. The issue started when Justin Sun was said to have moved about $143 million worth of Ethereum which is 39,999 ETH to HTX. These transfers happened soon after Ethereum’s drop below $4,000 and that dropped to $3,127. However, Sun explained on X post that he did not sell his Ethereum. He said that the transfers were just internal wallet movements and also confirmed that he still believes in Ethereum’s long-term potential, despite the price drop. Despite the transfers he still holds about 42,904 ETH which is worth around $139 million. Reports show that Sun has moved over 108,919 ETH to HTX since November 10 at an average price of $3,674, time of these transactions usually when prices are high.

Its trading volume, now at $28.64 billion, has also dropped slightly. Analysts think Ethereum could recover well, with some spotting patterns that hint at a possible price rise. Analyst Javon Marks identified “Adam & Eve Double Bottom Pattern,” which could push Ethereum above $4,000 and possibly up to $4,800 in the near future. Despite recent price changes, Ethereum is still a major player in the blockchain world. Its strong role as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and ongoing technological improvements make it an important part of the crypto ecosystem. Sun’s renewed support for Ethereum reflects the overall optimism about its future growth and success.

Popcat (POPCAT) is one such example. Those who jumped on the train early witnessed exponential growth, while others watched from the sidelines, regretting their hesitation.

Why BTFD Coin Stands Out BTFD isn’t just banking on hype; it’s building an ecosystem that rewards its holders. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards offering an eye-popping 90% APY, and a referral programme incentivising community growth, the project is designed for long-term success. The beta version of the P2E game is already live, showcasing the team’s commitment to delivering value even before the presale ends. While no rewards are earned in the beta version, the final game promises to integrate BTFD tokens, allowing players to earn while they play. Additionally, BTFD’s Bulls Squad—a vibrant community of investors—adds a layer of resilience and collective power to the project. As part of this squad, you’re not just investing in a coin; you’re joining a movement dedicated to seizing opportunities during market dips and riding the wave to financial success. Presale Success and Investment Example The BTFD presale has already raised over $4.44 million, selling more than 58 billion tokens to over 6,500 holders. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, scarcity is engineered into tokenomics. Let’s put the potential gains into perspective. If you invest $3,000 at the current Stage 7 price of $0.000064, you’ll secure approximately 46,875,000 BTFD tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $28,125—an astounding return on investment. Join the BTFD Presale Before the BIG50 Deal Ends Getting in on the action is straightforward: Go to the Presale site and connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “ BIG50 ” in the designated field to claim the discounted Stage 7 price. Input the amount of BTFD tokens you wish to purchase. Review the discounted price and confirm your purchase. This limited-time offer ends on January 5, 2025, so don’t wait too long. The next bull market could be your gateway to financial independence, and BTFD Coin is your ticket. Popcat: The Missed Opportunity Popcat ($POPCAT) burst onto the scene with a quirky yet captivating backstory tied to the viral Popcat meme. It was a community-driven project that leveraged the power of Internet culture to gain massive traction. Early investors who recognised the potential of this unique meme coin reaped the rewards as the token’s value skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of $1.67 in October 2024. Popcat’s Meteoric Rise and Fall POPCAT’s initial success was fuelled by a robust marketing strategy, high-profile exchange listings, and a dedicated community. Its listing on Binance and KuCoin added legitimacy and liquidity, attracting a wave of new investors. The token’s market cap surged as it climbed the crypto rankings, making headlines and creating overnight millionaires. However, like many meme coins, POPCAT’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. After hitting its peak, the token experienced a significant correction, losing over 65% of its value in the following months. This downturn highlighted the volatile nature of meme coins and the importance of timing in the crypto market. Those who missed out during the early stages of POPCAT’s rise often look back with regret, wondering what could have been. Why BTFD is the Best Bet Right Now The story of POPCAT serves as a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration. It underscores the potential of meme coins to deliver astronomical gains but also the necessity of getting in early. With BTFD Coin currently in its presale stage, history is offering a second chance. Don’t be the person who looks back and says, “I should have invested.” Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Next Big Thing The world of cryptocurrency moves fast, and opportunities don’t wait. Popcat’s meteoric rise and subsequent correction are reminders of the potential rewards and risks in this space. While many missed the chance to turn POPCAT into a financial windfall, BTFD Coin presents a fresh opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a promising project. With its limited-time rollback to Stage 7 pricing and an ecosystem designed for long-term growth, BTFD Coin is undoubtedly the top crypto presale of the moment. Act now, claim your discount with the code “ BIG50 ,” and secure your stake in BTFD Coin before the presale ends. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers—join the Bulls Squad today and make 2025 the year you seize the dip and soar to new heights.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 00:26:40

However, the same cannot be said for centralized finance protocols, whose losses have more than doubled in the past year. Hacken’s report shows that DeFi losses represented 20.4% of the total crypto hacks losses, while CeFi accounted for 30% in 2024. However, compared to last year, DeFi losses lessened by 40%, dropping from $787 million in losses to only $474 million in losses this year. CeFi losses skyrocket to $694M in 2024 CeFi losses grew dramatically, rising to $694 million from $339 million in 2023. The DMM Bitcoin hack in May 2024 stood out as the largest CeFi breach, with losses reaching approximately $305 million. About 4502.9 BTC was transferred to an unknown wallet, before being redistributed to other addresses. Another major CeFi hack, the WazirX hack, accounted for 42.8% of Q3 crypto losses, with nearly $240 million siphoned. An attacker breached their system, acquiring signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, enabling them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and drain the funds. Despite the DeFi sector achievements, some protocols were still heavily affected by hackers’ exploits including Radiant Capital. The DeFi firm lost over $55 million after a hacker gained access to their system using some malware, manipulating legitimate transaction approvals, and bypassing the protections of hardware wallets. Over $1.7 billion was lost to access control exploits in 2024 Over $2.3 billion has been drained by hackers from the crypto space in 2024. Both the DeFi and CeFi sectors were heavily hit by access control vulnerabilities. Access control exploits accounted for 75% of all crypto hack losses and nearly half of all DeFi losses, draining more than $1.7 billion. In addition, phishing scams drained over $600 million in 2024. Most of them were a combination of inclusive celebrity-endorsed rug pulls and presale scams. Hacken’s report even highlights that hacks and breaches across crypto and metaverse platforms persisted into 2024, due to weaknesses in private key management systems, poor security measures, single-signature vulnerabilities, and insecure private key backups.

Besides, several experts have further fueled optimism with anticipation over a surge in crypto ETFs this year. So, here we explore some of the top altcoins to watch like XRP, SOL, HBAR, and others, amid the ETF buzz. Top Altcoins To Watch Amid Crypto ETF Buzz XRP, SOL, HBAR, and others, are among the top altcoins to watch now, with soaring ETF anticipation after Donald Trump’s election win. For context, these leading altcoins have gained immense traction with recent insights from Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart. The analysts predicted that Litecoin and Hedera ETFs are likely to debut first, given their regulatory clarity compared to Solana and XRP. The first wave of crypto ETFs is expected to include Bitcoin and Ethereum dual offerings, which have already gained traction among institutional investors. Firms like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Hashdex have filed for these ETFs, signaling their confidence in regulatory approvals. These products could set the stage for top altcoins ETF, especially for assets like Litecoin, which is recognized as a commodity. Hedera stands out due to its classification outside the “ security ” label by the SEC, making it a prime candidate for early ETF adoption. On the other hand, XRP and Solana face regulatory hurdles that may delay their ETF launches, though their market popularity keeps them in the spotlight. This evolving landscape could redefine crypto investments, introducing new opportunities for both retail and institutional players. Market Optimism Soars Amid ETF Anticipation The crypto market has witnessed significant gains after Trump’s win in November. For context, the market is anticipating a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US under the Republican government. It also creates buzz on ETF, with investors keeping a close watch on the top altcoins. In other words, the ETF buzz has been one of the prime catalysts behind the price surge of these cryptocurrencies. XRP price soared 63% last month, trading at $2.238, with a 30-day range of $1.296 to $2.869. Its quarterly growth reached an impressive 278%, with a $127 billion market cap ranking it the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. HBAR price surged 116% over the past month to $0.31, marking a 424% quarterly gain. It ranks within the top 20 by market cap at $11.87 billion. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) price dropped 21% last month to $192 but recorded a 28% quarterly gain. It holds a $92 billion market cap, ranking as the 6th largest cryptocurrency.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is attempting to break from its downtrend, with some market watchers suggesting it is poised for a massive run in 2025. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Ethereum Key Levels To Reclaim With only a week left in 2024, several market watchers have started forecasting the crypto market’s potential performance for next year. Despite the recent pullbacks, several analysts have predicted a remarkable performance for Ethereum in 2025. The King of Altcoins has struggled to turn the $4,000 level into support. After breaking past this level earlier this month, ETH has been rejected from this price range three times. Its latest attempt occurred a week ago when Ethereum soared to $4,100 before retracing 7.3%. As Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $92,000, the second-largest crypto continued its freefall to the $3,100 support zone, reaching its lowest price in a month. Since then, Ethereum has hovered between $3,200 and $3,550 but failed to break past the price range’s higher zone for the past four days. However, the cryptocurrency has broken out of its downtrend line and is attempting to reclaim the $3,500 support. A crypto analyst noted that ETH appears to have broken and retested its one-week downtrend after reclaiming the $3,400 support. According to the post, a “clean breakout” of this downtrend could lead the cryptocurrency to a retest of higher levels. Ali Martinez highlighted that ETH’s next big support zone was between the $3,032 and $3,132 price range, with 4.85 million ETH bought by 3.69 million addresses. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s next big resistance wall is between $3,640 and $3,740, where over 2 million addresses bought around 4.3 million ETH. To Martinez, “a sustained close outside this no-trade zone will determine the direction of ETH’s trend.” Will ETH Follow 2021’s Performance? Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that “the first four months after U.S. elections are often highly bullish for ETH.” Per the chart, Ethereum registered massive gains in the first third of the year after the 2016 and 2020 US elections. In 2017, Ethereum started the year with a 31.92% increase in the first month, while it recorded a 78.51% surge in January 2021. In both years, ETH hit its peak monthly performances between March and April, seeing 214% and 44% returns in 2017 and 2021, respectively. If Ethereum repeats this historical performance, its price could surge above its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 in January and continue to climb during the rest of Q1. Crypto trader Immortal noted that Ethereum’s recent performance resembles its 2020-2021 price action. According to the chart, ETH saw a significant rise in early 2021 before consolidating in its new range. This was followed by a breakout and a massive drop to retest consolidation zone. Related Reading: Solana Recovery Momentum Set The Stage For $194 Resistance Breakout However, when ETH reclaimed its breakout levels in 2021, the cryptocurrency continued rallying toward its previous ATH of $4,300, eventually hitting its current ATH at the end of the year. The trader notes that ETH is retesting the consolidation range after last week’s dip, which signals that the cryptocurrency could soar in the coming weeks if it follows a similar path. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,501, a 6.3% increase in the last 24 hours.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 849,000 YouTube subscribers that if the Federal Reserve doesn’t bring back quantitative easing (QE), then ADA could continue to slip. “There’s also a chance [ADA] could go lower, especially if it follows what it did last cycle… If it were to drop 56%, that would actually put you below $0.60, which is right where it went last time… There’s always a chance that it comes back down to [the $0.357 price level], because [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell just says ‘no QE, continue on playing in the sandbox and the cryptoverse and we’ll give you QE sometime later.’ There’s a chance that happens.” Quantitative easing is when a government’s central bank purchases financial assets to increase the money supply and stimulate economic activity. Cowen goes on to say that ADA’s technical indicators, such as its 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and 21-week exponential moving average (EMA), are lining up with the theory that the crypto asset could see another sizeable dip. “The other thing to look at is the bull market support band. The bull market support band for ADA to Bitcoin – you can see that first of all, it wicked below it [in mid 2023] but it had a weekly close right around the 20-week SMA. [Earlier this year] it was just above the 21-week EMA, so I would also keep an eye on that. The 20-week SMA for ADA is around $0.56 [and] the 21-week EMA is around $0.67, so that would also correspond to [a price tag of around $0.53].” ADA is trading for $0.89 at time of writing, a 3% increase during the last day. On December 2nd, it was valued at $1.21.

This deal will help the company provide over 70 MW of power at its Lake Mariner facility. This shift from Bitcoin mining to AI will bring in more money and meet the growing need for energy-efficient infrastructure . TeraWulf Expands into AI Infrastructure TeraWulf Inc., mining company recently announced an expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. On December 23, the company revealed that it had signed agreements to lease data center space to Core42 which is an AI and cloud services provider. According to the deal, TeraWulf will provide over 70 megawatts (MW) of data center power at its Lake Mariner facility in Upstate New York. The infrastructure will also be rolled out in phases between the first and third quarters of 2025. These data centers will be set up to support Core42’s GPU clusters, using advanced Dell Integrated Rack Scalable Solutions. This partnership marks an important shift for TeraWulf, placing the company at the crossroads of two fast-growing industries: AI computing and Bitcoin mining. By leasing its data center space to Core42, TeraWulf is diversifying its sources of income and increasing its long-term earnings potential. The company has mainly focused on Bitcoin mining with sustainable operations and is now expanding into AI as a new business model. The increasing demand for efficient, scalable computing infrastructure in both AI and cryptocurrency sectors gives TeraWulf a great opportunity to benefit from these growing markets. TeraWulf’s CEO, Paul Prager , stressed how important this partnership is. He said it helps the company expand beyond Bitcoin mining and positions it as a leader in AI-driven computing. He pointed out that moving into AI will be a key factor for future growth, especially as the company continues to use mostly zero-carbon-powered infrastructure. This fits with TeraWulf’s larger goal of offering energy-efficient and scalable solutions to meet the growing demand for digital infrastructure. The data center lease agreement will provide TeraWulf with a steady and profitable income over time. The leases have two five-year renewal options and the chance to add 135 MW of power, which shows there is a lot of potential for growth. TeraWulf’s ability to quickly set up customized data centers also puts it in a good position to meet growing demand in both the AI and cryptocurrency sectors. TeraWulf’s move into AI comes at a time when Bitcoin mining is facing challenges. The cost of Bitcoin mining increases depending on several factors, such as electricity prices, hardware efficiency, and the mining space. Increase in Bitcoin Mining rates A recent report by CoinShares showed that the cost to mine a Bitcoin increased by 13%, reaching $55,950 in Q3 2024. This rise in costs has caused Bitcoin miners, including TeraWulf, to lose market share. Many are cutting back on mining to focus on AI projects, with some even buying Bitcoin directly instead of expanding their mining operations. TeraWulf’s move into AI-driven computing is part of a wider trend in the cryptocurrency mining industry, where companies are seeking new revenue sources due to rising costs. The company’s stock was affected by these challenges, with its price dropping 12.1% on December 23, reflecting broader market trends. However, TeraWulf has had a strong performance in 2024, with its stock price up by 152.6%, partly due to Bitcoin’s rise in value. As businesses and governments continue to seek AI solutions currently, the demand for this type of computing is expected to rise. TeraWulf’s focus on providing AI infrastructure powered mostly by zero-carbon energy gives it an edge in this market. TeraWulf’s partnership with Core42 is a smart move that sets the company up for long-term success in both AI and cryptocurrency. While it faces challenges in Bitcoin mining, its shift to AI-driven computing could help the company grow. With its focus on energy-efficient infrastructure, TeraWulf is well-placed to take advantage of the increasing demand for both AI and cryptocurrency services.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 01:34:00

This Revolutionary Layer 1 Presale is Redefining Blockchain Potential,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-xrp-this-revolutionary-layer-1-presale-is-redefining-blockchain-potential/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunities, and for those of us who’ve been watching for the next big thing, it’s clear: the blockchain space is evolving faster than ever. If you’ve skipped out on Ripple’s XRP, one of the industry’s well-known players, don’t worry – there’s a new project that’s capturing attention with its revolutionary technology and groundbreaking potential: Qubetics ($TICS) . In a landscape dominated by projects like XRP, which have brought significant changes to the world of cross-border payments, Qubetics is a fresh contender that’s setting out to redefine what a Layer 1 blockchain can do. With its presale already raising over $7.7 million and more than 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics ($TICS) is on track to offer some of the most promising returns in the space. But what makes Qubetics stand out against established players like Ripple? Let’s dive into the features, recent developments, and price predictions to find out why Qubetics might just be one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today . 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Scalability and Interoperability Qubetics is an emerging Layer 1 blockchain that is already capturing attention for its innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. Currently in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $7.7 million and sold more than 374 million tokens, with prices set to surge by 10% as it enters the 15th stage. At just $0.0377 per token, Qubetics represents a potential goldmine for early investors. Qubetics is unique in that it focuses not only on blockchain scalability but also on cross-chain interoperability, allowing seamless communication and transactions between various blockchain ecosystems. This is an area where Ripple and other established projects have had limitations. While Ripple focuses on payments, Qubetics is looking to create an all-encompassing Layer 1 blockchain solution that connects multiple blockchains , making it easier for developers and users to access various ecosystems without friction. Recently, Qubetics has been integrating with top blockchain players, laying the groundwork for a robust and interconnected ecosystem. This opens up possibilities for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise solutions that benefit from its speed, low fees, and high scalability. The ongoing presale has generated immense interest, and analysts are predicting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, providing investors with a 564% ROI. Decentralised VPN: Real-World Use Cases One of Qubetics’ standout applications is its Decentralised VPN . This feature offers a unique solution to individuals and businesses in Southeast Asia, where internet privacy and access restrictions are common concerns. Imagine a business in Indonesia wanting to protect its online operations from surveillance or a professional in Vietnam needing to access global websites without restrictions. With Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN, they can do so securely, bypassing local network restrictions and ensuring that their online presence remains anonymous. For businesses looking to securely engage with clients across borders, a Decentralised VPN built on Qubetics could offer peace of mind, knowing that their communications are encrypted and decentralised, free from the reach of central authorities or government interference. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Qubetics’ innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability sets it apart from other Layer 1 blockchains like Ripple. Its real-world applications, such as the Decentralised VPN, and its ongoing presale success make $TICS a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to secure long-term returns in the blockchain space. 2. Ripple (XRP): The Giant of Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP has been a dominant player in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space for years, particularly in the realm of cross-border payments. Its focus on providing a fast, secure, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking systems has earned it a strong reputation. Priced at around $0.438, XRP remains one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for anyone seeking exposure to the payments industry. Ripple has seen significant adoption in the financial services industry, with a growing list of banks and financial institutions integrating its technology to streamline cross-border transactions. XRP’s real-time settlement system, known as RippleNet, continues to expand, providing a faster alternative to traditional SWIFT transfers. However, despite its success in the financial sector, Ripple has faced regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States. The ongoing lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cast a shadow over XRP’s future. The outcome of this legal battle could have long-term implications on XRP’s price and regulatory status, potentially affecting its ability to continue growing as a global payments solution. Despite these challenges, XRP remains a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for those looking for a solid investment in the payments sector. Its strong partnerships, established use cases, and solid network make it a reliable choice, though investors must be mindful of the regulatory uncertainties. Why did Ripple (XRP) make it to this list? XRP’s continued dominance in the cross-border payments space and its solid market performance make it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today, especially for those seeking a trusted and well-established asset in the crypto market. However, potential regulatory risks mean that investors should keep a watchful eye on its future developments. Qubetics vs. Ripple for Short-Term and Long-Term Gains Let’s take a closer look at how an investment of $8,000 would perform in both Qubetics and Ripple. With Qubetics, the current price per $TICS token is $0.0377. If you were to invest $8,000 in Qubetics at the current presale price, you would receive approximately 212,870 tokens. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, giving you a 564% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $51,435. If $TICS continues to rise after the presale and reaches $1, your $8,000 investment would grow to $212,870, representing a 2,555% ROI. Even more optimistic projections suggest that $TICS could hit $5 after the mainnet launch, making your $8,000 investment worth $1.06 million—a 13,176% ROI. The explosive potential of Qubetics is hard to ignore. On the other hand, if you were to invest $8,000 in Ripple at the current price of $0.438 per token, you would be able to purchase approximately 18,270 XRP tokens. While XRP has shown steady growth, analysts predict more moderate returns, with a potential rise to $0.50 over the short term. This would offer a 14% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $9,120. Ripple’s price growth tends to be more stable, but its future is tied to regulatory outcomes, which could impact its short-term and long-term growth prospects . Why did Qubetics make it to this list? The potential for exponential returns from Qubetics in the presale phase makes it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors looking for high-growth opportunities. While Ripple remains a solid and reliable asset, Qubetics’ innovative features and rapid growth make it the more compelling option for short-term and long-term gains. What Are The Top Altcoins to Buy Today Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project that offers greater potential for growth compared to Ripple (XRP). While XRP continues to dominate the cross-border payments space, Qubetics provides a broader vision with its focus on scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. The Qubetics presale has already raised over $7.7 million, and with a unique application like the Decentralised VPN, it has positioned itself as one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors seeking high returns . If you missed the boat on XRP, now is the time to consider Qubetics. With explosive potential, an innovative approach, and a presale that’s already showing incredible growth, $TICS is the Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to capitalise on the future of blockchain technology. Don’t wait—secure your $TICS tokens today and watch your investment grow as this revolutionary project continues to unfold!

Celestia, for instance, is turning heads with its innovative Web3Bay project, promising to be the next big thing in decentralized e-commerce. Meanwhile, EOS is mounting a comeback, thanks to updates that enhance scalability and functionality, reigniting investor interest. Both projects are gaining traction, making them standout options in the hunt for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , quietly but confidently taking the crypto world by storm. Its presale has already sold over 374 million tokens, raising $7.7 million from more than 11,700 holders. But what sets Qubetics apart isn’t just the numbers—it’s the utility. With its game-changing wallet developed in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is tackling real-world crypto problems head-on. Let’s dive into how these projects are shaping up. Qubetics: The Wallet That Changes Everything Qubetics isn’t just about selling tokens; it’s about delivering real value. Its non-custodial multi chain wallet , created in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, is all about simplicity and security. Whether you’re paying for groceries or managing a diverse crypto portfolio, this wallet turns complex blockchain transactions into everyday ease. Let’s break it down: Say you’re a business owner. A customer pays you in Ethereum, but you need cash. No problem—Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism automatically swaps crypto into fiat at the point of sale. This means you’re shielded from crypto’s notorious volatility while still enjoying the benefits of digital payments. The presale numbers tell a story of trust. With over 374 million tokens sold and $7.7 million raised, Qubetics is clearly striking a chord with investors. At $0.0377 per token, the window to join is closing fast before the 10% price hike in the 15th stage this weekend. If you’re scouting the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics deserves a spot on your shortlist. Celestia: Building the Future of Web3 Celestia is on a mission to revolutionize the blockchain world with its modular approach. By separating consensus and data availability, Celestia allows developers to create highly customizable blockchains, which could pave the way for the next wave of Web3 applications. But here’s where it gets exciting: Web3Bay. Dubbed the “eBay of Web3,” this platform aims to transform decentralized e-commerce. Imagine buying and selling goods online with total transparency and no intermediaries skimming off the top. Celestia’s role in this project positions it as a leader in the Web3 revolution. Of course, no project is without risks. Celestia’s success hinges on developer adoption and the broader market’s appetite for Web3 solutions. But with its innovative tech and growing ecosystem, it’s a strong contender for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. EOS: A Comeback in the Making EOS has been through its fair share of ups and downs, but 2024 might just be its redemption arc. Known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, EOS is making a comeback with updates aimed at improving scalability and interoperability. These enhancements are designed to attract both developers and investors, positioning EOS as a viable alternative to Ethereum. Recent developments have included partnerships with several dApps and initiatives to improve community governance. The EOS Network Foundation has also ramped up efforts to increase adoption, focusing on sectors like gaming and DeFi. But can EOS reclaim its former glory? While the project shows promise, its path forward isn’t without challenges. That said, for those willing to bet on a comeback story, EOS remains one of the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. Conclusion In a market as dynamic as crypto, diversification is key. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking wallet and strong presale performance, offers practical solutions that set it apart. Celestia is redefining what’s possible with Web3 applications, and EOS is showing that comebacks are very much a thing. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, these three projects are worth a closer look. Qubetics stands out for its innovation and investor confidence, while Celestia and EOS bring unique strengths to the table. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Celestia (TIA), and EOS (EOS) as the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 .

Although the critical support above $2.10 has remained intact, indicating a strong buyer interest at below levels, the lack of any positive news that had the market in a state of euphoria in the first weeks after Trump’s election appears to be cooling down inflated expectations. The on-chain data, however, paints a different picture for XRP. According to Santiment data shared by Twitter/X crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales have accumulated 40 million XRP over the last 24 hours, suggesting that seasoned market participants are closely watching for the new breakout. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has added 3.08%, which may be a sign that the market is starting to react to renewed whale activity. Should the momentum continue, XRP may reclaim the recent highs at the $2.7 level. Currently, the main potential catalysts for the XRP price to watch for are RLUSD stablecoin listings, XRP spot ETF approval, and progress in the Ripple vs SEC case. RLUSD stablecoin went live on December 17 on XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, with initial listings on several exchanges and crypto platforms, including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA. Although it’s reasonable to assume that any attempt to corner the saturated stablecoin market will be met with fierce competition from established issuers Tether ($140 billion worth of USDT) and Circe ($43 billion worth of USDC), the use cases and utility brought by RLUSD are expected to drive demand for XRP as well. Considering that Ripple’s stablecoin is yet to be listed on Binance or Coinbase, any upcoming listings are likely to be treated by the investors as “buy the rumor, sell the news” events. After the successful debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, the crypto industry is anticipating approval for other Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, including XRP and SOL. Major players like WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have already filed for XRP ETFs and the leadership change at the SEC brought by Trump’s win makes the approval a much more likely thing than one would expect under Gary Gensler’s reign. Finally, the resolution of the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case also seems like a plausible outcome after Gensler’s resignation effective on Inauguration Day. With crypto-friendly Chair Paul Atkins at the helm, the new SEC is likely to drop non-fraud lawsuits, experts forecast. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.30, positioned at the level of the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) but holding above the 21-day EMA at $2.24. These indicators suggest a potential short-term bullish momentum, as the price is consolidating near its faster EMA and maintaining support above its medium-term trendline. Should the price successfully move away from its 9-day EMA, this would reliably signify the start of an upward trend. Conversely, a fall below the 21-day EMA would mean the inability to sustain momentum, leading XRP to potentially retest a $2.10 support. For context, the exponential moving average is a type of a moving average indicator that assigns more weight to the recent prices, making it more sensitive to the latest price changes when compared to a simple moving average. The 9 and 21-day EMAs are commonly used by traders to identify short-term trends. RLUSD gets listed on Bullish On Tuesday, Bullish, an institutional crypto exchange backed by tech mogul Peter Thiel, officially listed Ripple’s much-anticipated stablecoin. The exchange users will be able to trade it across seven pairs, namely RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, XRP/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD and SOL/RLUSD. Before Bullish, RLUSD also went live on Bitso, Independent Reserve, and Mercado Bitcoin. The stablecoin became available to the general public shortly after Ripple managed to secure approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement. According to CoinMarketCap , RLUSD currently has a market cap of $53 million, which places the stablecoin at the 2,978th place ranked by market capitalization. Over the past 24 hours, it generated a trading volume of $8.6 million, a 719% increase from the day before. RLUSD will be initially available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK, and Middle East regions, CoinDesk reported, quoting Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoin at Ripple. The token won’t be available for EU customers due to the lack of a necessary license to comply with the bloc's MiCAR regulations, although the company is actively exploring ways to enter the European market.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-25 01:49:10

A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson highlights that TON has moved into a favorable risk zone for accumulation, as indicated by the Normalized Risk Metric (NMR). This metric evaluates an asset’s price risk relative to historical data, providing a clearer picture of whether the current price levels are suitable for investment or if caution is warranted. Related Reading: Toncoin Consolidates: Could A Breakout Push TON Higher? Toncoin Current Market Outlook The NMR uses moving averages such as the 50-day and 374-day simple moving averages (SMA) along with logarithmic differences in price data to determine risk exposure. A normalized score ranging between 0 and 1 indicates the level of risk, with values closer to zero suggesting a lower chance of price decline. According to Wedson, TON’s current placement in the green zone signals reduced risk, making it an appealing opportunity for investors seeking long-term exposure to the asset. The analysis further suggests that while the medium and long-term risk profiles appear favorable, there remains a possibility for TON’s price to revisit historically significant support zones, often referred to as the “blue zone” on price heatmaps. Historically, these levels have served as price floors and accumulation points for investors expecting future price appreciation. Open Interest Decline and Market Volatility Trends Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, has added further context to Toncoin’s current market stance. According to his observations, TON’s Open Interest (OI) in the futures market has decreased to $141 million, marking the lowest level observed in the past nine months. Open Interest refers to the total value of outstanding futures contracts and is a key indicator of market sentiment and participation. A decline in Open Interest generally signals reduced market activity and lower volatility. While this trend is specific to TON, it reflects a broader pattern across the cryptocurrency market as the year comes to a close. Historically, periods of low Open Interest are often followed by significant price movements, either upward or downward, once liquidity returns to the market.

PEPE recently witnessed a dramatic 30% price drop after soaring to record highs, stirring questions about its future prospects. Concurrently, the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 points to a potential $10 value, sparking debates over the viability of its environmentally friendly blockchain to achieve sustained growth. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as a top crypto of 2024. Attracting significant attention, this project has amassed over $172 million in presale contributions and achieved an impressive 2,240% ROI since its inception. With its advanced hybrid blockchain and directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology, industry insiders are bullish about BDAG’s prospects to hit the $1 mark, positioning it as the prime crypto to get your hands on. PEPE Suffers a Sharp 30% Decline Post-Peak PEPE’s journey took a downturn recently, with a sharp 30% fall from its peak price of $0.0000293 on December 9. This significant dip has triggered skepticism regarding the sustainability of its initial explosive growth, suggesting it might have hit its peak. Technical analysis shows bearish trends, hinting at a possible further drop to $0.0000105 if crucial support levels fail. While there’s hope among some circles for a bounce back, others are bracing for a possible extended decline, advising caution among followers. Near Protocol’s 2025 Forecast: Climbing to $10 The outlook for Near Protocol has garnered mixed reviews from experts, some are optimistic about its future, while others caution against potential obstacles. Current predictions place its price at around $10.01 by 2025, fueled by its scalable and energy-efficient technology. Despite notable advancements in decentralized apps and its green tech credentials, Near Protocol contends with uncertainties from market dynamics and regulatory environments. Currently priced at $5.74, the pathway to the anticipated $10 remains fraught with unpredictability. As the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 suggests potential growth, savvy crypto watchers are advised to stay informed and assess the evolving market domain to pinpoint the most promising long-term investments. BlockDAG’s Sprint to $1: Is a 4200% ROI on the Horizon? BlockDAG has quickly become a powerhouse in the crypto sphere, amassing an impressive $172 million through its presale in mere months. A staggering 17.5 billion BDAG coins have been purchased, with early participants already reaping a 2,240% ROI as the price catapulted from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0234 in the latest Batch 26. This explosive growth has catapulted BlockDAG into the spotlight as the most buzzworthy crypto project currently. Enthusiasts and major players alike are drawn to its potential, especially with anticipated exchange listings that could push its value to the coveted $1 mark. Should BDAG reach this milestone, those holding Batch 26 could see a staggering 4200% ROI. Crypto analysts point to BlockDAG’s cutting-edge hybrid technology—merging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) efficiency with blockchain’s robust security—as a key driver of its presale success. This tech innovation enables faster transactions, greater scalability, and increased security, captivating a global audience and spurring a surge in demand for BDAG coins. Moreover, BlockDAG’s mining operations are thriving, generating over $6 million from the sales of more than 15,000 mining units. These units, known for their efficiency, are quickly being snapped up by those eager to maximize their BDAG earnings. As demand continues to rise, the current crypto presale for Batch 26 is poised to sell out soon, potentially driving prices higher. This presents a golden opportunity to get involved with BDAG at a still accessible price of $0.0234 per coin. Today’s Top Crypto Investment Opportunities In contrast, the PEPE price has recently fallen by 30%, stirring doubts about its future performance, while the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 anticipates a steady rise to $10, buoyed by its sustainable technology. Yet, it’s BlockDAG that’s leading the pack in the altcoin market with its remarkable achievements and substantial presale earnings. With breakthrough DAG technology and booming mining sales, BlockDAG is on a fast track to potentially hit the $1 threshold soon, which could unlock a 4200% ROI for current Batch 26 holders. For those scouting for the best crypto to buy, seizing BDAG coins now might be the smartest move in today’s volatile market.

This Breakthrough Presale Might Be What You’re Looking For,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-vechain-this-breakthrough-presale-might-be-what-youre-looking-for/,"Cryptocurrency markets have been buzzing with innovation lately. It seems like there’s always something new on the horizon, and the possibilities seem endless. If you’ve been keeping an eye on VeChain (VET), you’re likely aware of its success in integrating blockchain technology into supply chain management and logistics. With its impressive real-world use cases, VeChain has carved out a solid niche for itself. But what if you missed out on it? What if you could invest in something that’s offering even more potential for growth? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain that’s grabbing attention for its forward-thinking approach to scalability, decentralisation, and cross-chain interoperability. The presale for Qubetics is on fire right now—having raised over $7.7 million with more than 374 million tokens sold. The price per token is set to increase by 10% as it moves into the 15th stage. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio with one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week , Qubetics could be the perfect opportunity. But why should you consider Qubetics over a well-established project like VeChain? Let’s take a deeper dive and compare the two. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Interoperability Now, let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS). This emerging Layer 1 blockchain offers a fresh take on decentralisation, scalability, and cross-chain interoperability. Unlike VeChain, which is focused primarily on supply chain applications, Qubetics provides a blockchain solution that aims to connect different ecosystems, facilitating seamless interaction between them. The project is in its 14th presale stage, with over $7.7 million raised, and it’s set to grow even more as it enters the 15th stage, which will see a 10% price increase. Qubetics is a multi-functional blockchain, offering far more than just supply chain solutions. It’s designed to provide high scalability and low-cost transactions, all while supporting decentralisation and interoperability with other blockchain networks. This means that Qubetics isn’t limited to one industry or use case—its potential spans across multiple sectors, from DeFi to NFTs and beyond. The project’s innovative cross-chain interoperability allows developers to seamlessly integrate their dApps and other projects across different blockchain ecosystems. For example, a business in India could use Qubetics to transfer assets between Ethereum and Solana, opening up a world of possibilities for cross-chain projects, which VeChain doesn’t offer at the same scale. Additionally, Qubetics’ Web3 aggregator technology provides a unified platform for users to interact with different blockchain networks, making it much easier to manage assets and applications in a decentralised manner. Qubetics also stands out for its Cross-Border Transactions, which open new doors for businesses looking to operate securely across borders. Imagine a company in Sri Lanka that needs to securely send payments and data to partners in Europe and the US without worrying about intermediaries or high fees. Qubetics’ infrastructure allows businesses to securely interact on a global scale, without the same limitations that traditional financial systems have. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Qubetics is redefining blockchain potential with its scalable, decentralised, and cross-chain interoperable infrastructure. Its ability to offer Cross-Border Transactions securely and affordably makes it one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week , especially for investors seeking growth beyond a niche market like VeChain. 2. VeChain (VET): The Supply Chain Solution VeChain (VET) has long been considered a major player in the blockchain space due to its focus on improving supply chain management. Priced at around $0.4381, VeChain’s innovative technology uses blockchain to track products across the entire supply chain, improving transparency, reducing fraud, and increasing efficiency. This use case has made it one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week for those seeking exposure to supply chain and logistics industries. VeChain’s blockchain is primarily used to provide transparency for supply chain data, allowing businesses to track products from origin to consumer. Its blockchain solution has been implemented by companies in various industries, including automotive, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods. In recent years, VeChain has expanded its reach with high-profile partnerships, including collaborations with big companies like Walmart China and BMW, further establishing its position in the supply chain space. While VeChain continues to grow and gain adoption, its reliance on a centralised model means it faces limitations in terms of decentralisation and scalability. The focus on improving supply chains is powerful, but VeChain is somewhat limited to its niche, and it doesn’t have the same level of flexibility as some other projects when it comes to integrating with multiple blockchain ecosystems. Why did VeChain make it to this list? VeChain has established itself as a leader in supply chain solutions, and its blockchain technology is being adopted by several large enterprises. For those looking to invest in a solid blockchain project with proven use cases, VeChain remains one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week, though its scope is somewhat narrow when compared to more flexible Layer 1 solutions like Qubetics. Qubetics vs. VeChain Let’s compare how an investment of $5,000 would look in both Qubetics and VeChain. With Qubetics, the price of $TICS tokens is $0.0377 at the 14th presale stage. If you invest $5,000, you would get about 132,017 tokens. Analysts predict that at the end of the presale, $TICS could reach $0.25, offering a 564% ROI. That would mean your $5,000 investment could grow to around $32,084.25. If $TICS reaches $1 after the presale, your investment would be worth $132,017, yielding a 2,555% ROI. More optimistically, if $TICS hits $5 after the presale, your $5,000 investment could reach $660,085, giving you a 13,176% ROI. The potential for high returns with Qubetics is clear, especially with its unique approach to blockchain scalability and cross-chain transactions. On the other hand, if you were to invest $5,000 in VeChain at its current price of $0.4381, you would receive about 11,418 VET tokens. While VeChain has seen solid growth, analysts are projecting more modest price increases. If VET rises to $0.50 over the next year, your $5,000 investment would grow to about $5,719, offering a 14% ROI. While VeChain is a stable investment, its price growth is expected to be slower compared to the explosive potential of Qubetics. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? The explosive growth potential of Qubetics during its presale, combined with its innovative technology and real-world applications like Cross-Border Transactions , positions it as one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week. The returns from $TICS could far outpace VeChain, making it the more attractive option for investors seeking high growth. What Are The Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week? Based on our analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) is a far more versatile and high-potential investment compared to VeChain (VET). While VeChain has proven itself in the supply chain sector, Qubetics offers a much broader range of applications, from cross-chain interoperability to secure cross-border transactions, positioning it for significant growth. The ongoing presale, which has already raised over $7.7 million, provides a unique opportunity to invest in the future of blockchain technology. If you’re looking for a Top Altcoin to Invest in This Week with the potential for massive returns, Qubetics is the clear winner. With its disruptive technology and promising presale success, now is the perfect time to secure your $TICS tokens before the price increases further. Don’t miss out—join the future of blockchain and watch your investment grow.

With the momentum behind Qubetics’ presale, there’s no better time to explore the top coins with 1000x potential. 1. Qubetics: Empowering Blockchain Development as a Top Coin with 1000x Potential Qubetics ($TICS) is reshaping blockchain innovation with its game-changing QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment crafted for simplicity and efficiency.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 02:55:00

With its presale priced at $0.003, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly gaining recognition as a potential game-changer. Offering a seamless fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has positioned itself as a frontrunner in the race to revolutionize decentralized applications. But does it have what it takes to lead the market in 2025? Rise of Lightchain AI More Than Just a Cryptocurrency Unlike a lot of digital coins that depend only on buzz or limited uses, Lightchain AI mi͏xes new tech to give real value. Its Smart Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Smarts (PoI) make it different from others, giving place for growing, smart-led apps. The AIVM acts as a new level where makers can use AI-based answers for fields such as money, health care, and supply chain work. At the same time, the PoI way keeps that the network stays power-saving and useful rewarding users for fixing AI jobs instead of old mining or betting. Can Lightchain AI Outpace Market Giants? The cryptocurrency market is dominated by heavyweights like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). However, Lightchain AI’s unique combination of AI integration and blockchain scalability positions it to compete with and possibly surpass these established players. Ethereum (ETH) While Ethereum is the go-to platform for decentralized applications, its scalability issues and high transaction fees remain persistent challenges. Lightchain AI’s advanced infrastructure could address these pain points, making it a viable alternative. Solana (SOL) Known for its speed, Solana faces concerns about decentralization and network stability. Lightchain AI, with its robust technology and sustainable consensus model, offers a more balanced solution. Ripple (XRP) Ripple focuses on cross-border payments, but Lightchain AI’s broader applications give it an edge in market diversification. Key Factors That Could Propel Lightchain AI to Market Leadership Innovative Technology Driving Adoption The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers developers to create advanced dApps, enabling industries to leverage blockchain technology in ways never seen before. This focus on utility ensures widespread adoption across sectors. Deflationary Tokenomics With its deflationary model, where a portion of transaction fees is burned, Lightchain AI ensures long-term scarcity. This mechanism incentivizes holding and increases demand, creating upward pressure on the token’s value over time. Early Investor Opportunity Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI provides a rare ground-floor investment opportunity. Analysts project the token could reach $20 by 2025, representing a staggering ROI of over 600,000% for early backers. Why 2025 Could Be the Year of Lightchain AI As the blockchain and AI industries continue to expand, Lightchain AI’s positioning at the intersection of these technologies gives it a significant advantage. With a strong roadmap that includes the mainnet launch and strategic partnerships, the project is well-equipped to capture market share. Moreover, the growing demand for decentralized, AI-powered solutions across industries could catapult Lightchain AI into the spotlight, making it a household name in the cryptocurrency space. Plus, with the global push towards sustainability and energy efficiency, Lightchain AI’s unique Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism could attract environmentally-conscious investors and further drive adoption.

Yep, it’s BTFD Coin, an exciting newcomer that’s out to shake up the meme coin space! Alongside familiar faces like Baby Doge and SPX6900, BTFD Coin is gaining attention with its buzzworthy presale success and juicy 50% festive discount. If you’re looking to cash in on the best new meme coins for massive return potential, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s get this party started, shall we? Now, let’s talk numbers, because what we’re really after is serious gains—and the numbers behind BTFD Coin are looking pretty darn spectacular. We’re in Stage 12 of the presale, with over $4.44 million raised in record time (seriously, under 14 days to hit $2.5 million? That’s impressive). And if you’re looking for a deal, hold onto your hats: BIG50 is the code that unlocks a 50% discount on your BTFD purchase. Take a moment to absorb that: a 50% festive discount on an already hot presale. Did someone say “opportunity”? Yes, yes they did. Let’s dive into the features of BTFD Coin and how it’s designed to bring in massive returns. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves First things first—why is BTFD Coin so special? Well, if you’re in the crypto space, you’ve probably heard of the BTFD mindset, which stands for “Buy The Dip.” If you’re wondering what this has to do with anything, it’s the core philosophy of the BTFD Coin community. Inspired by the chaos of the 1973 market crash, BTFD Coin offers a unique proposition: seize opportunities during market downturns just like smart investors did back then, cashing in some huge gains. As a result, Stage 7 is the perfect moment to get more $BTFD at a reduced price, giving investors a big edge. Now, let’s talk about the big picture: BTFD Coin’s presale success isn’t just about hype—it’s a combination of powerful tokenomics, a high-APY staking program , and a P2E game that’s ready to blow up. With Stage 12 currently in play, the BTFD Coin presale is over halfway to its final goal, and over 58 billion $BTFD coins have already been sold. If that doesn’t scream massive return potential, I don’t know what does. So, what does that actually mean in terms of gains? Let’s say you dropped $57,000 into BTFD Coin at today’s price of $0.000064 per coin. Here’s the math: at that price, you’d be picking up 890,625,000 $BTFD coins. If the price increases to the presale target of $0.0006 per coin, that $57,000 investment could potentially balloon into $534,375—talk about serious gains! With the BIG50 festive discount, this scenario isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem! Baby Doge: A Meme Coin with Heart Now, let’s shift gears a bit and talk about Baby Doge. This little pupper is making waves on the BNB chain, and it’s hard to ignore the adorable face of the coin. Originally created as a joke (hey, aren’t all the best things born this way?), Baby Doge has evolved into a community powerhouse that spreads awareness for animal adoption. But beyond being a cute mascot, Baby Doge is a meme coin with some real utility—like its AI image generator and NFT capabilities, which let users create their own Baby Doge characters and images. In addition to its community-driven mission, Baby Doge is also helping real animals. The coin’s record-breaking donations have provided over 81,000 pounds of dog food to pups in need. If you’re into coins with a cause, Baby Doge definitely checks that box. As for the investment potential, Baby Doge has a large circulating supply of 161,680,749,827,200,480 BABYDOGE coins, with a market cap hovering around $583 million. SPX6900: The Blockchain Token That’s All About Innovation And then we have SPX6900—a meme coin bringing a fresh approach to the blockchain space. Unlike the others, SPX6900 isn’t just focused on memes—it’s leveraging advanced cryptography and promising limitless applications. As the name suggests, SPX6900 is all about going big or going home. With its powerful blockchain capabilities, SPX6900 is eyeing scientific and technological fields for its future growth. The token’s price has been rising steadily, currently sitting at $0.771778 with a 24-hour trading volume of $47 million. Ranked at #127 on CoinMarketCap, SPX6900’s market cap of $718 million suggests there’s room for growth, especially if the project’s innovative blockchain solutions gain traction. The circulating supply stands at 930,993,090 SPX tokens, with a total max supply of 1 billion tokens. How to Claim Your BTFD Coins and Unlock the BIG50 Code Start by going to the Presale Page , then follow these simple steps: Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code: Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50 , and click “Apply”. Enter Purchase Details: Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Still Has A High Greed Value The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing this mentality. Its value being greater than 53 means the investors as a whole are showing greed, while it being under 47 implies the presence of fear in the market. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Giving Potential Buy Signal, Quant Says Now, here is how the current sentiment in the sector looks according to the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 73 at the moment, which suggests the average trader is holding a sentiment of greed. This greed sentiment is also a particularly strong one, so strong in fact that it’s sitting very close to a special region called the extreme greed. The extreme greed occurs when the index reaches a value of 75 or higher. A similar zone also exists for the fear side, known as the extreme fear, and is situated at 25 or under. Historically, the extreme sentiments have proven to be important for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as tops and bottoms have tended to occur while the market has been inside these zones. The relationship between price and sentiment has generally been an inverse one, meaning extreme greed leads to tops and extreme fear to bottoms. The BTC top earlier in the month occurred when the index was at a value of 87. With the price decline that has occurred since then, market sentiment has cooled off a bit. The question is: has it cooled enough? While other phases of the market usually require dips into fear or extreme fear for bottoms to take place, bull markets generally don’t see pullbacks that deep. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment Often times, a venture into the normal greed zone or the neutral territory is enough for the price to regain steam. That said, the recent sentiment has still been quite close to extreme greed, so it may need a bit more before a real turnaround is reached. The Fear & Greed Index calculates its value using multiple factors, one of which is social media sentiment. While the overall sentiment has still been positive, it seems social media users have started to show fear, as the analytics firm Santiment has pointed out in an X post.

ETH is now recovering some losses and might rise if it clears the $3,550 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,350 zone. The price is trading above $3,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,425 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if it clears the $3,520 and $3,550 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum price remained stable above $3,220 and started a recovery wave like Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $3,350 and $3,400 resistance levels. The price even cleared the $3,500 resistance level. However, the bears remained active below the $3,550 level. A high was formed at $3,534 and the price is now consolidating gains. It corrected some points below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,226 swing low to the $3,534 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,425 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,520 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,540 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,720 resistance zone or even $3,800. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,550 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,425 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,375 zone. A clear move below the $3,375 support might push the price toward the $3,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,110. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Currently, only 53% of SHIB holders are reporting profitable positions, reflecting broader concerns about the asset’s performance and market dynamics. Declining Investor Activity and Profitability Profitability metrics highlight SHIB’s struggles in maintaining investor confidence. A significant factor in its recent downturn is the reduced activity among large investors. Over the past week, the number of substantial transactions has dropped by 60.9%, signaling reduced participation from whales and institutions—key players that often drive significant price movements. The asset’s reliance on a concentrated group of holders exacerbates its vulnerability to market fluctuations. Notably, 73% of SHIB’s total supply remains under the control of major players, further amplifying its susceptibility to large price swings. Key Support and Resistance Levels The token’s price has declined significantly from its previous highs and is now trading near its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a critical support zone. A breach of this level could lead to further declines, potentially testing the 200-day EMA. On the upside, the $0.000023 resistance level remains a crucial benchmark for any potential recovery. However, given the current market sentiment, a breakout above this resistance appears unlikely in the short term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Network Growth and Community Engagement A concerning trend for SHIB is the slowdown in its network growth, with fewer new wallet activations observed. This decline suggests diminishing interest from new investors, a critical factor for sustaining momentum in a speculative market like SHIB. Additionally, metrics from the asset’s Telegram community indicate reduced engagement, pointing to waning enthusiasm among existing supporters. A shift in market sentiment is essential for the asset to regain its footing. This could come in the form of renewed whale activity, a substantial increase in network growth, or a successful breach of critical resistance levels. Until these conditions materialize, cautious optimism may be the best approach for current investors. Key price levels to monitor include the $0.000020 support and the $0.000023 resistance. These zones will likely play a significant role in determining the token’s near-term trajectory. Investors should remain vigilant and assess broader market conditions before making important decisions. The token’s ability to recover will depend on reversing the negative trends in investor activity, community engagement, and network expansion. Without these improvements, the asset’s challenges may persist, limiting its potential for a significant rebound.

The United States Department of Justice announced that the pair face charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and stalking. According to prosecutors, Hay and Mayo promoted various NFT and digital asset projects, providing misleading roadmaps and making “materially false and misleading statements” about their intentions to fulfill project promises. One such project, Vault of Gems, was marketed as the first NFT project “pegged to a hard asset.” However, prosecutors claim the duo abandoned the initiative after collecting millions from investors. Principal Deputy Attorney General Nicole Argentieri stated: “Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo allegedly defrauded investors in digital asset projects of tens of millions of dollars and threatened an individual who attempted to expose their roles in these fraudulent schemes.” When a project manager revealed their involvement in another NFT project, Faceless, Hay and Mayo allegedly resorted to harassment and intimidation, targeting the individual and their family. The Justice Department revealed that the duo used similar tactics across multiple projects, including Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, MoonPortal, and Squiggles. To obscure their involvement, they reportedly misrepresented others as the project owners. Argentieri emphasized the Justice Department’s commitment to combating digital asset fraud, saying: “Fraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors’ hard-earned money.” Officials vowed to work with law enforcement to uproot crypto fraud schemes and protect investors.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Metaverse|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 03:58:00

The crypto has caught the eyes of investors lately, especially after the crypto market witnessed volatile trading after the latest US FOMC. However, despite the volatile trading, SHIB on-chain metrics indicate a bullish momentum ahead for the crypto. Shiba Inu News: SHIB On-Chain Metrics Hints At Breakout Ahead The investors are keeping close track of Shiba Inu news, especially as the crypto has recorded a surge of over 6% today. Notably, the top meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and others have recorded massive volatility over the past few days, amid a broader crypto market crash. However, the recent performance indicates that the investors are regaining confidence in the risk-bet assets after a recent pause. Meanwhile, the SHIB on-chain metrics also indicate a hovering bullish momentum in the market. According to Santiment data, the Shiba Inu exchange supply declined significantly, indicating that funds are flowing out of the top crypto exchanges . Notably, the declining exchange supply indicates that investors are moving out funds from exchanges, which in turn could significantly boost the asset’s price.

Santiment data showed that whale transactions have noted a robust surge recently, after muted activity over the past few weeks. Source: Santiment Considering all these aspects, the future of the top dog-themed meme coin looks promising. So, let’s explore how the SHIB price is performing and how the meme coin might perform in the coming days. SHIB Breakout Ahead? The positive Shiba Inu news, especially the on-chain metrics, appeared to have boosted the market confidence. SHIB price today was up more than 6% and exchanged hands at $0.00002284, while its one-day trading volume dropped 9% to $610 million. Furthermore, Shiba Inu Futures Open Interest jumped nearly 10%, indicating a bullish market momentum. Amid this, the recent technical Shiba Inu price chart indicates a breakout ahead. For context, the inverse head and shoulder pattern indicates that the crypto could hit $0.000035 in the near term. Once this target is achieved, the crypto will rally to about $0.000045 ahead. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, a recent SHIB price analysis also indicates that the crypto could hit the $0.000035 mark in the near term. Considering all these positive trends of the coin, it appears that SHIB is gearing up for a breakout soon.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 04:23:00

Issued at the request of Finnish authorities, it follows allegations of tax fraud and assault in the country. Tax Fraud and Assault Charges The Red Notice is a formal request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal actions. However, it does not constitute an international arrest warrant. Earlier this year, Heart was also featured on the European Union’s Most Wanted List for the same charges. Finnish authorities allege that he committed tax fraud between 2020 and 2024, with a remand order first issued against him on September 13, 2024. “For the purpose of avoiding tax, Schueler failed to observe a statutory duty pertaining to taxation that is of significance in the assessment of tax,” read the tax fraud allegation. The authorities claim that the 45-year-old failed to file business tax returns for multiple years and omitted information about his income in pre-filled personal returns. They allege that he received income from business activities that should have been declared to the tax administration for assessment, with the total amount of dues avoided reaching hundreds of millions of euros. In a separate case, Schueler is also wanted in Finland for allegedly assaulting a minor. Schueler Defends Legacy Amid Interpol Notice While the accused has not directly addressed the Red Notice, in a December 22 post on X, he seemed to reference the situation indirectly, challenging his ‘haters’ and highlighting his philanthropic efforts. “Why settle for being wanted when you can be the most wanted?” read the post, referencing his claimed $27 million contributions to medical research, self-help books, and P2P publishing software. He emphasized his belief in his positive impact, expressing that he strives to ‘make the world a better place’ despite feeling that those who make a difference often face unkindness. Meanwhile, the Hex creator is also involved in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2023, the regulator sued him, accusing him of unregistered securities sales and fraudulent activities. The agency alleges that Heart conducted an unsanctioned sale of cryptocurrency securities that raised over $1 billion. He is accused of promoting Hex as a “blockchain certificate of deposit” between December 2019 and November 2020. Further, he is said to have promised high returns and attracted $678 million in investments, but the token’s value later dropped by 98.4% from its peak. The SEC also claims Heart raised $354 million for PulseChain, supposedly for development, but used the funds for personal luxuries. In January 2024, he filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the financial watchdog opposed, arguing it failed to address the allegations or meet legal standards.

How Remittix (RTX) Is Transforming Finance With PayFi,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cross-border-payments-using-crypto-how-remittix-rtx-is-transforming-finance-with-payfi/,"The demand for flawless and quick cross-border payment solutions has never been more evident in a time when financial institutions are becoming ever more digital. With its creative PayFi technology, Remittix (RTX) is leading the way in enhancing this industry and closing the gap between cryptocurrencies and conventional fiat systems. This innovative method lets individuals and companies transmit crypto-to-fiat payments all around the globe, therefore releasing the full potential of digital currencies in regular financial operations. Remittix has been identified as the best crypto investment of the year because of how it is revolutionizing cross-border payments with its safe, reasonably priced, transparent platform, providing a smarter substitute for conventional banking institutions. The Need for Practical Payment Solutions Cryptocurrencies have become more and more popular as the world’s economy fast turns toward digitization. Though the creative uses of cryptos are great, their capacity to interact with conventional monetary systems still lags greatly, therefore restricting the potential of cryptos for regular people and companies. Here Remittix finds value in providing innovative infrastructure meant to close the distance between digital currencies and the conventional banking system. As a result, investors seeking long-term returns are accumulating RTX, the utility token for the Remittix ecosystem and one of the best cryptos to buy now . Given the over $3.2 trillion worth of cryptocurrencies today, the need for sensible, safe, quick payment methods has never been stronger. Particularly in cross-border payments, cryptocurrencies are considered a quick substitute for conventional banking systems. Still, their interaction with fiat systems presents a difficulty, sometimes keeping users from fully appreciating the advantages of embracing cryptocurrencies. Remittix exists to correct that. The Crypto-to-Fiat On/Off-Ramp Market: A Crucial Bridge Bridging the distance between the cryptocurrency ecosystem and conventional financial institutions depends on the crypto-to-fiat on/off-ramp market. While off-ramps let users cash out their crypto holdings into fiat, on-ramps let them turn fiat money into cryptocurrencies. As acceptance of cryptocurrencies worldwide quickens, demand for these services is rising. The market for crypto payment gateways is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% from 2024 to 2032; it was valued at $1.2 billion in 2023 . Remittix is the best crypto investment now as it is set to take a sizable portion of this expanding market while cryptocurrencies get more included in regular corporate activities. Remittix is establishing itself as a pioneer in cross-border payments by providing a safe and quick way to turn more than forty cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies. Transforming the Cross-Border Payments Sector The global economy depends much on cross-border payments. They assist trade, investment, and the flow of capital and people by allowing money to be internationally exchanged. From about $150 trillion in 2017 to over $250 trillion by 2027 , cross-border payments’ value is predicted to rise, hence underlining the need for reliable and safe payment systems. But especially in underdeveloped areas, conventional cross-border payment systems may suffer from exorbitant costs, poor processing times, and limited access to financial services. Remittix provides a more affordable, quick, and safe substitute to meet these difficulties. Remittix lets users rapidly convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies using blockchain technology and local payment networks, therefore avoiding hidden fees or difficult processes. Remittix guarantees that users get a better deal by offering flat, clear rates unlike conventional banks, who charge hefty foreign exchange (FX) fees and wire transfer costs. What you send is exactly what the recipient receives. Remittix’s strategy is based on simplicity and openness, which makes it the perfect answer for companies and people wishing to transmit cross-border payments free from the complexity of conventional banking systems. Remittix: Empowering Businesses and Consumers Remittix is transforming cross-border personal payments as well as enabling companies that want to take crypto payments. Companies can now take crypto payments via the Remittix Pay API and settle them in fiat straight to a selected bank account. This creates fresh chances for businesses to use the expanding crypto market while avoiding the complexity and volatility sometimes linked with crypto transactions. Using Remittix, businesses may also create a merchant account, granting them complete control over how they pay their cryptocurrency. Remittix offers the flexibility and simplicity required to easily handle payments whether one wants to turn their assets into any of over 30 fiat currencies or more than 50 different cryptocurrencies. Remittix is a must-have tool for companies trying to keep ahead of the curve in a fast-changing financial scene since crypto payments fit well into the conventional financial ecosystem. The Remittix Presale: A Golden Opportunity for Investors Remittix is one of the best cryptos to buy now as it promises huge ROIs for investors while it keeps extending its products and offerings. Right now in presale is the RTX token, which runs the Remittix ecosystem. At approximately $0.0156 , each RTX token is an appealing investment choice for individuals wishing to profit from the expansion of the crypto-to-fiat transfers sector. RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in because of the rapidly increasing demand for fast and efficient cross-border payment solutions. Just a few weeks have seen more than 20 million RTX tokens sold, proving the great investor demand. Analysts estimate that before the presale concludes, RTX token value could rise by 500% given the limited presale token supply and fast escalating investor demand. Hence, RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in while the presale is still ongoing. Some analysts project a possible 50x surge in the value of the RTX token during the ongoing bull run following the debut next year. Meanwhile, over $375,000 has been raised already in a matter of days and analysts expect this value to hit $500,000 by the end of the week. Remittix has also passed a SOLIDProof audit without any problems, therefore confirming the platform’s dedication to client confidence, openness, and security.

Remarkably, Bitcoin was the best-performing investment of 2024, rising by 140% in just 12 months. Bitcoin skyrocketed to a record high of $108,000 in December. Notably, several events led to Bitcoin’s growth. The first BTC ETF was approved in January which turned out to be very successful attracting huge inflows. Further, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his very anticipated November win in the US Presidential elections further fueled Bitcoin’s price. Besides, Trump’s pick of Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair has further boosted the expectations of favorable regulations in the crypto community. The Impact Of Influential Figures The crypto world is largely shaped by influential figures with their actions and views largely impacting the market dynamics. Prominent personalities like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Brad Garlinghouse, among others, are contributing to a more favorable setting for innovation and growth in the crypto space. Let us dive deeper to know who were the 10 most influential figures in crypto this year. 1. Donald Trump – Former President of the United States, crypto advocate. The President-elect Donald Trump endorsed pro-crypto policies during his presidential campaign and enabled fundraising for his inauguration via cryptocurrency donations. He also promised to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve in his second term. The Trump campaign also accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he appeared at industry events, promising to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet”. He also promised to create a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council. He has boosted the market confidence by signaling a pro-crypto regulatory stance, which led to increased adoption and investments. 2. Elon Musk – CEO of SpaceX, Tesla Elon Musk has frequently backed cryptocurrencies through his X posts. In 2021, Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and also planned to accept the coin as payment for its product and services. According to Bloomberg reports , the tech billionaire was also the largest political donor in the country, as he spent at least $270 million to support Donald Trump’s bid for the US presidency. Trump has also selected Musk to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk occasionally speaks on other altcoins, but he generally speaks of Bitcoin and dogecoin in his public commentaries. Musk’s influence on crypto remains beyond comparison which also reflects how a person can ignite global discussions and shift market dynamics. 3. Brad Garlinghouse – Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple has been an influential voice in the cryptocurrency space. He has oftentimes stressed the importance of clear and fair regulation for cryptocurrencies and has been vocal about the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC. He also expressed excitement when Trump chose Paul Atkins to be the next SEC Chair stating that he will bring common sense back to the agency. Besides, Garlinghouse has described the recent US election as a turning point for the crypto industry noting the impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s surprising shift toward a pro-crypto stance during the campaign. “I think it’s clear that Donald Trump embraced crypto and crypto embraced Donald Trump,” he stated. 4. Michael Saylor – Microstrategy’s Chairman Recently, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor has emerged as one of the biggest supporters of the crypto realm. Saylor is known for his vocal support of Bitcoin and his company’s substantial Bitcoin holdings. He has expressed strong backing for Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor recently presented a three-minute pitch to Microsoft’s board of directors, urging them to consider buying Bitcoin. He told Microsoft’s board of directors that Bitcoin could be a force multiplier for the company’s balance sheet, and its valuation.“Microsoft has a choice to make: Cling to the past or embrace the future,” he said. However, Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal for the company to possibly buy Bitcoin. 5. Cynthia Lummis – US Senator US Senator Cynthia Lummis had proposed the idea of creating a Bitcoin national reserve. She had also suggested that the US government could sell some Federal Reserve’s Gold to fund the Bitcoin purchase. She has called 2025 a critical year for Bitcoin and crypto, as major government positions and proposed policies are expected to line up and bring about significant changes in the sector. She has also remarked that with David Sacks as Crypto Czar, this will be the most pro-digital asset administration ever. 5. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Back in 2017, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink had said that Bitcoin was “an index of money laundering,” arguing that the cryptocurrency primarily reflects how much money is being made from criminal activity, he now believes that Bitcoin is an asset class in itself and is an alternative to other commodities like gold. While Fink admitted to being a proud Bitcoin skeptic earlier, after exploring more about it, he concluded that his previous opinion held for five years, was wrong. Remarkably, Fink’s BlackRock has turned out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the post election surge in Bitcoin. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) has swelled by $13 billion since Trump’s win on Nov. 5, pushing iShares Bitcoin Trust past $40 billion in assets just 10 months following its launch. 7. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan is an entrepreneur and innovator in the blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Shayne is the CEO of Polymarket, which is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can trade on the outcomes of world events using blockchain. This year, Polymarket arosef the most fascinating and potentially valuable use cases in the growing crypto industry. As the 2024 U.S. presidential race developed, it attracted many new users who successfully predicted important events, like Biden’s withdrawal and Trump’s win. 8. Vivekramaswamy – American Biotech Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate, has been selected by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency alongside Elon Musk. Musk and Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, aimed to improve governance and cut down on wasteful expenditures. Ramaswamy, an active advisor in former President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, has consistently voiced strong support for Bitcoin. He views it as a robust alternative to the US dollar, highlighting its role in holding the Federal Reserve accountable and preventing currency manipulation. He spoke at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville earlier this year, where Trump promised to turn America into a “Bitcoin superpower.” Prior to that, he had noted that he would implement a “comprehensive crypto policy framework” if elected commander-in-chief. 9. John Deaton – Legal Advocate John Deaton, a renowned crypto lawyer and legal advocate, has been widely praised for his role in the Ripple (XRP) case. He has been skeptical about Gary Gensler as well who he belives to be stifling innovation in crypto and has endorsed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. In a recent YouTube interview with the Good Morning Crypto podcast Deaton had noted that the SEC’s handling of cryptocurrency regulation in the Ripple lawsuit led to nearly $15 billion in losses for small crypto investors. Founder of the law firm Deaton Law Firm, he has become a well-known figure within the crypto community for his efforts to protect the rights of retail investors and push back against regulatory actions he believes could harm the industry. 10. Paul Atkins – Former SEC Commissioner President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to run the SEC, Paul Atkins, is the leader the crypto industry wanted. Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a “proven leader for common sense regulations.” In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. Conclusion These prominent figures are creating a unique collaboration between politics, business, and technology which could entirely transform the crypto landscape. With the incoming pro-crypto administration, with Paul Atkins all set to be the next SEC Chair, and advocates like John Deaton raising their voices for clearer crypto regulations, the crypto industry is all set to witness a whole new era of growth and innovation.",Top 10s in Crypto Market,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 04:47:51

DeFi Platforms Show Better Security Mechanisms In its annual “Web3 Security Report,” Hacken outlined the general trends in the cryptocurrency industry with regard to scams and security infrastructure. The report notes that total losses arising from security failure in 2024 stood at $2.91 billion. Related Reading: WazirX Exchange Releases Post-Mortem Report: Was North Korea Behind The $235M Exploit? DeFi protocols accounted for $474 million in losses this year, a 40% decline from $787 million in 2023. This sharp drop reflects the growing adoption of advanced security techniques, such as zero-knowledge cryptography and multi-party computation, across the DeFi ecosystem. One key factor contributing to the reduction in DeFi exploits was the sharp decline in cross-chain bridge hacks. Losses from these attacks have consistently fallen – from $1.89 billion in 2022 to $338 million in 2023, and finally to $114 million in 2024. In contrast, CeFi platforms, including cryptocurrency exchanges, reported $694 million in losses in 2024, more than double the $339 million recorded in 2023. CeFi accounted for nearly one-third of all crypto-related incidents, highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in centralized systems. Gaming and metaverse projects were another major target in 2024, responsible for nearly 20% of all crypto-related hacks, with $389 million in losses. The largest gaming/metaverse breach of the year was the PlayDapp exploit in Q1 2024, which resulted in a $290 million loss. Phishing scams also remained a significant concern, causing more than $600 million in losses this year. These scams highlight increasingly sophisticated social engineering tactics in the Web3 space. In November, the sector faced a $129 million address poisoning attack. For context, address poisoning phishing involves attackers sending small transactions from an address that closely resembles one the victim has interacted with, tricking them into mistakenly sending funds to the fraudulent address in future transactions. Memecoins And Rugpulls Continue To Prey On Users While memecoins were all the rage for the majority of 2024 – particularly on the Solana (SOL) blockchain due to its low transaction costs – a significant proportion of them preyed on investors through presale scams and celebrity-endorsed rug pulls. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment One notable example is the Hawk Tuah memecoin, launched by viral influencer Hailey Welch, popularly known as “Hawk Tuah Girl”. The coin’s value plummeted 95% shortly after launch, sparking severe backlash from the wider Web3 community. The rise in memecoin-related scams also underscores the need for greater investor education, particularly when engaging with such speculative assets.

Table of Contents Solana powerhouse in blockchain and DeFi Dogecoin still relevant in the meme coin arena New contender Lightchain AI The future of altcoins and why Lightchain AI may lead the pack As the cryptocurrency market approaches 2025, Solana (SOL) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and the rising altcoin Lightchain AI (LCAI) are drawing serious attention from investors. While Solana continues to dominate the blockchain space and Dogecoin holds its ground in the meme coin market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a potential game-changer. Investors are buzzing about its explosive growth potential, particularly with the Lightchain AI presale , which is creating a unique opportunity to get in early on this promising token. Analysts are even predicting a jaw-dropping 30,000% rally for LCAI, which could surpass both Solana and Dogecoin in the coming months. Let’s dive into what makes these three coins stand out and why Lightchain AI might just steal the spotlight. You might also like: Cardano and Toncoin take a backseat as Lightchain AI presale shines Solana powerhouse in blockchain and DeFi Solana has emerged as a leading blockchain platform, renowned for its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it a preferred choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its unique combination of proof-of-history and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms enables the network to process thousands of transactions per second, significantly outpacing many competitors. As of December 23, 2024, Solana’s price is approximately $180.80, reflecting a slight increase of 0.31% over the previous close. The platform has experienced substantial growth, with its market capitalization reaching over $86 billion. Recent developments include the introduction of Solana Pay, a payment processing system that allows merchants to accept payments in SOL, further expanding its ecosystem. Analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s future, with some predicting significant price increases by 2025, driven by its technological advancements and growing adoption in the DeFi and NFT sectors. Dogecoin still relevant in the meme coin arena Dogecoin, the original meme cryptocurrency, continues to maintain its relevance in the crypto market. As of December 23, 2024, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.31, reflecting a slight decrease of 1.91% from the previous close. The intraday high reached $0.32, with a low of $0.31. Recent developments have significantly impacted Dogecoin’s market performance. Notably, President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement of the “Department of Government Efficiency”, to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, resulted in a substantial surge in DOGE’s value. Following the announcement, Dogecoin’s price increased by nearly 20%, trading at $0.42 and achieving a market capitalization of nearly $60 billion. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, with some predicting a potential rise to $0.50 by 2025, driven by its growing acceptance and community support. New contender Lightchain AI Lightchain AI , a new token in the meme coin space, is gaining attention for its potential 30,000% rally. Combining elements of meme coin culture with blockchain technology, LCAI offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward assets. The coin’s unique tokenomics provide unique incentives for holders, including rewards tied to staking and community participation. Lightchain AI also benefits from viral marketing, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with growing community enthusiasm driving interest. Strategic partnerships and upcoming DeFi integrations further add to its appeal. If LCAI continues on its current trajectory, it could achieve 30,000% gains, potentially reaching a price of $3 by the end of 2025, outperforming both Solana and Dogecoin. The future of altcoins and why Lightchain AI may lead the pack As we approach 2025, cryptocurrencies like Solana, Dogecoin, and Dogen are poised to benefit from the increasing interest in altcoins. While Solana continues to dominate the blockchain space and Dogecoin remains a popular meme coin, Lightchain AI is emerging as a major contender with its immense growth potential and unique features. Lightchain AI combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, addressing critical challenges in scalability, privacy, and governance. With its low presale price of $0.003, LCAI offers a unique opportunity for early investors to gain exposure to its anticipated growth. As the 2025 altcoin season kicks off, Lightchain AI stands out as a potential leader, poised to deliver life-changing returns for those who get in early. Keep a close watch on LCAI as it prepares to change the crypto space. To learn more about Lightchain AI, visit the website , whitepaper, X , and Telegram.

RCO Finance set to disrupt DeFi landscape with AI-Powered tools Making institutional investment accessible for everyone Conclusion As the year draws to an end, the XRP price is making news, approaching its all-time high of $3.40, a mark it attained nearly seven years ago. Analysts are now hopeful about the token’s prospects, with an almost 300% rise year-to-date that positions the fourth-largest cryptocurrency for new records. XRP to reach $5 on Christmas Day? After a recent major decline of 9% in the last two weeks, the XRP price has increased by 3.4% to $2.25 within just 24 hours, ending the week above essential support levels. This recovery sets the XRP price to maintain its remarkable upward trend, having increased more than 100% since November 5, aligning with the political changes in the United States. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized the significance of the $2.20 support level, stating that as long as the XRP price holds above this mark, it could consolidate prior to aiming for the $2.70 resistance. The analyst thinks that if the XRP price falls below $2.20, it might lead to a drop to $1.96. Martinez also observed an increase in whale activity, with major acquisitions of 80 million tokens since December 17, indicating positive sentiment for XRP. Notably, in a recent poll conducted by market analyst CryptoinsightUK on social media site X (formerly Twitter), a majority of respondents anticipated the XRP price would reclaim the $3.30 level by Christmas day. However, the analyst projected a possible new all-time high of $5 for the XRP price by December 24, with bold expectations of hitting $10 and more from January to March 2025. In the midst of these optimistic predictions for the XRP price, a new contender is rising in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space: RCO Finance. Scheduled for launch in 2025, the platform’s native token RCOF will introduce a range of cutting-edge products and tools, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to present investors with distinct chances to grow their portfolios and improve capital returns. RCO Finance set to disrupt DeFi landscape with AI-Powered tools In contrast to XRP, which fulfills particular use cases like cross-border payments and gas fee transactions on the XRP Ledger, RCO Finance seeks to make advanced investment strategies accessible to everyone. The platform provides tailored investment strategies, extensive asset availability, a KYC-free financial environment, AI-driven market modifications, and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). RCO Finance’s no-code automated tool allows users, irrespective of their financial expertise, to improve their investments without depending on brokers or intermediaries. This convenient accessibility particularly appeals to new investors looking to capitalize on market trends, which amid the current bullish cycle, provides a crucial opportunity for further portfolio growth. Interestingly, the platform also provides access to an extensive selection of more than 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 categories, featuring conventional investments such as stocks and bonds, alongside digital assets and tokenized real-world items. Making institutional investment accessible for everyone A notable aspect of RCO Finance is its know-you-customer (KYC)-free environment, which emphasizes user privacy and removes lengthy identity verification procedures. This aspect is especially appealing to investors who prioritize anonymity and want to participate in decentralized finance without the usual onboarding challenges. The platform’s AI technology also offers immediate portfolio modifications in response to market changes and user activity, allowing traders to take advantage of new trends without needing to monitor constantly, a vital benefit during unstable market situations. Yet, one of the most appealing tools for investors is the platform’s capacity to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), enabling users to invest in products such as real estate and commodities via blockchain tokens. This fractional ownership model opens up markets that were previously inaccessible to regular traders and reserved for institutions, enabling investors to participate without needing a large amount of capital. Conclusion Overall, RCO Finance is poised to tap into several growth trends intersecting crypto and AI, offering a comprehensive suite of tools that present a unique opportunity for investors. While the XRP price is forecasted to surge, RCO Finance distinguishes itself with its innovative offerings. Currently, the RCOF token is valued at $0.077 in its fourth presale stage, with predictions suggesting it could rise to $0.214 in the next bonus round, representing a nearly 200% return for early investors to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity.

This suggests that Theta investors are holding their existing positions, and new ones are joining. TAO strengthens its position as one of the best AI cryptos While Bittensor ( TAO ) is not exploding at an enormous rate like Theta’s token price , it’s growing rapidly and is on course to equal its all-time high. TAO is an open-source protocol that supports a decentralized, blockchain-based machine learning network. In this system, machine learning models collaborate in training and are rewarded with TAO based on the value of the information they contribute to the collective. TAO also provides external access, allowing users to extract information from the network while adjusting its activities to meet their needs. TAO boasts 7.3 million tokens in circulating supply, 91 active trading pairs, and 21 million $ TAO in maximum supply with an enviable $4.5 billion asset market capitalization. Despite TAO and Theta’s dominance of crypto AI, Lunex’s amazing features support a more assured sustainability.

This is exactly what a newly launched crypto token did: it surged 5,500% despite the crypto market crash and made millions for a crypto trader. Crypto Trader Made $3.25M in Profits After Investing in UFD Crypto trading is an intricate investment process that requires multiple strategies, correct timing, identifying opportunities, and much more to earn significant profits. However, there are incidents where traders have heavy returns in a finger snap. And this is what this crypto trader did, as he invested $90 in a newly launched Solana meme coin and earned $3.25M in profits after the token skyrocketed 5,500%. Lookonchain, a famous crypto page, revealed this incident, in which the trader earned 36,067x returns over his UFD investment. More importantly, this happened within two days, leaving the netizens in shock. However, this is nothing new; investors have made such significant returns multiple times, including a crypto whale that earned 5M from the PENGU airdrop. What can $90 get you? This trader turned $90 into $3.25M in just 2 days by buying $UFD—an insane 36,067x return! #UFD https://t.co/wLEWwVnYAR pic.twitter.com/T1qs1Q7m1a — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 19, 2024 What is Unicorn Fart Dust, and Why Does It Blew Up? Over the years, many people have come to challenge the authenticity of crypto trading and become fans of its profit potential and use cases. The same happened with Basement Ron, a Gold enthusiast who wanted to prove that crypto is nothing and Gold is the real investment. To do so, he launched a Solana meme coin called Unicorn Fart Dust (UFD) and posted about this to let the people know how it failed. However, to his surprise, the token blew up within days, reaching a market cap of $500M. Moreover, the UFD price surged by 5,500%, making heavy returns for its holders, aka crypto traders. The token currently trades at $0.1666 with a market capitalization of $165M after a 42% surge in the last 24 hours. It also has a trading volume of $53,519,706 per Coingecko, representing its high demand. Interestingly, this is not the first time the crypto community has come together to prove someone wrong. Earlier, a GenZ kid launched a meme coin on pump.fun and attempted to use a rug pull scam. However, the crypto trading community pumped the token by 71,000%, leaving the kid with a minimal profit as he sold early. What’s The Lesson Here? Crypto trading is a vast industry, facilitating billions of trades. Some turn profitable, and others in loss. Here, the unpredictability and crypto market volatility make it even more challenging. However, a few with experience and crypto tradies strategies have made heavy returns, including this crypto trader who identified the opportunity in Unicorn Fart Dust (UFD) and turned his $90 into $3.25M. However, people must do proper technical analysis and research before investing.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 05:53:00

XRP: A fast and borderless cryptocurrency for seamless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and accessible worldwide. XRP enables secure and irreversible transactions without a central authority. Users do not need a bank account for settlements, making it inclusive. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion units. Ripple, initially called OpenCoin Inc., received 80 billion XRP to develop the ecosystem and improve network liquidity. They placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply release. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” reflecting its goal to facilitate smooth payment transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP’s features may make it an attractive option. Conclusion Although XRP and similar coins show less short-term potential, DOGEN distinguishes itself for those pursuing luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN is creating a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

While this price movement is positive, it does not appear impulsive. Nevertheless, XRP has been printing higher highs and higher lows since reacting to the support zone, signaling some bullish momentum. Fibonacci Targets and Ideal Price Move The current price action is part of an internal wave, and the ideal target for the C-wave of the D-wave is around $2.59. Although it’s uncertain whether the price will reach this level, this Fibonacci extension represents a reasonable milestone target. If this ABC structure plays out, we should see the price move towards this level before completing the larger wave pattern. Following this, an E-wave could set a higher low, paving the way for a potential breakout. Possible Triangle Pattern and Confirmation Needed The current price action could unfold into a triangle pattern, which is another potential scenario. If this is the case, the D-wave may eventually break out to the upside. However, to confirm this, the price must break above the previous A-wave high at $2.38-$2.39. If XRP fails to surpass this level, there is a possibility that the market is developing a different structure, such as the B-wave. Bullish and Alternative Wave Counts In the bullish triangle scenario, the pattern would involve waves A, B, C, D, and E, with no lower lows—just lower highs and higher lows before an upward move. Alternatively, in the blue wave count, we could be seeing a larger correction with a WX-Y structure, where the Y-wave could evolve into a triangle pattern. This scenario remains speculative at this stage, but it’s essential to consider as a potential market development. Key Levels to Watch: Support and Invalidation Points So far, support is holding strong. To invalidate the current bullish outlook, XRP would need to break below $2.24, followed by a drop below the swing low at $1.94, which occurred on December 20th. If these levels are breached, the blue wave count could become more likely, potentially leading to further downside and a move towards the Fibonacci target area between $1.80 and $1.39. Larger Time Frame: Long-Term Outlook On the larger time frame, if XRP continues its sideways movement or forms a wave four correction as outlined earlier, the overall pattern still suggests at least one more high, and potentially two, before completing the current wave structure. The next key targets could be around $3.25 to $3.30, which is near the all-time high.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 05:56:34

If this recovery catches on, it could trigger another alt season. To prepare for this outlook, here are the top five Ethereum tokens to turn $1K to $1MM before December 31. Top 5 Ethereum Tokens to Buy In December For $1M Profit The crypto market shines optimistically as Bitcoin forms a higher low and instills hope of a recovery rally today. As a result of this bounce, here are five Ethereum tokens to buy to turn $1K to $1M by December 31. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu price is one of the top meme coins of 2021 that still has huge potential to rally considering its lackluster performance in 2024. According to Santiment’s data, Net Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) indicator saw a massive negative spike of -233 million SHIB, indicating capitulation. Typically, capitulation events occur during severe downtrends, where holders panic sell. These points serve as a good reversal points and buying the dip could lead to huge gains. Hence, SHIB price seems primed for a quick rally, which is also an Ethereum token. SHIB NPL Pepe Coin (PEPE) Pepe Coin price could be the next good contender to turn $1K to $1M before December 31. Santiment’s supply on exchanges has dropped from 214 trillion tokens to 160 trillion between July 8 and December 25. This 25% decline indicates that investors are getting increasingly confident on PEPE, the frog-based crypto’s performance. Therefore, Pepe, an Ethereum coin, looks ready to shoot higher. If history repeats, PEPE could mirror the 2021 rally and help investors convert $1K to $1M. PEPE Supply on exchanges Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, the original meme coin, has shot up 350% in the past two months and shows promise of a further increase. With the 30-day MVRV dipping down to -22%, the opportunity, it shows that the short-term holders are capitulating. This is an area where price has previously formed bottoms, leading to a reversal. Furthermore, long-term holders tend to accumulate DOGE from capitulating long-term holders, adding credence to the bottom formation. PEPE Supply on exchanges Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat (POPCAT) price has crashed 70% since the November 17 peak of $2.08. As POPCAT bounces off the $0.64 key support level, the chances of a recovery rally are high. This cat-based meme coin surged 2,600% between March 2024. After getting listing on major exchanges, the uptrend for Popcat has stalled. However, if the previously seen momentum makes a comeback, this meme coin could trigger a massive rally. POPCAT/USDT 1-day chart Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin price is another meme coin that has recently taken off. The token surged 5,700% from November 3 to December 21. Since the meme token is relatively new, it has massive momentum and could take off, triggering another leg up that could help investors turn $1K to $1M before December 31. FARTCOIN Ethereum tokens are showing strength in the past few days and have potential to capture more upside in the coming days. This trend signals opportunities for investors looking to grow their portfolio. As a result, these ETH-based coins could help investors turn $1K to $1M before December 31, 2024.

Toncoin holders anticipate December new high Toncoin ( TON ) has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market in a week where large-cap assets have shown slow movement. After a sluggish start to November, TON has begun to show strong momentum, with impressive gains. Yet, investors remain unsure whether to go long, showing caution about TON’s sustainability. On-chain signals for Toncoin’s price are currently bullish, particularly the “90-day percent return,” a metric that tracks the price change over the last 90 days and offers insight into TON’s short-term trend and momentum. According to data from CryptoQuant, TON’s 90-day percent return recently turned positive, reflecting the upward movement in its price. Historically, when this metric shifts to positive territory, it’s often followed by solid momentum in price action. The recent shift in TON’s 90-day percent return signals growing investor confidence. More investors are willing to hold their $ TON, anticipating higher prices and continuing the bullish trend. Another key on-chain signal supporting this positive outlook for Toncoin price is the percentage change in open interest, which also positively flipped. Caution ahead for TRON (TRX) despite price surge The 180-day Sharpe ratio for TRON ( TRX ) recently spiked, signaling potential market volatility ahead. Historically, fluctuations in TRX’s Sharpe ratio have often indicated price tops for its TRX token, making it an essential tool for traders looking to understand market dynamics. The current high-risk alert suggests that while TRX’s price may continue to rise, the downside risks increase significantly at its current valuation levels. Despite the price surge, on-chain analytics for TRX show a significant decline in both whale and institutional transactions, coinciding with the recent price fluctuations. For example, large TRX holder inflows and outflows peaked in mid-November but have since decreased, signaling a reduction in interest from major investors. On November 27, the data revealed just 205.77 million TRX in inflows compared to 159.87 million TRX in outflows, indicating a shift in net demand that favors sellers.

The accounts were used to control meme coin scams by obtaining phishing email credentials. 1/3 A threat actor has stolen ~$500K over the past month by compromising 15+ X accounts (Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, Brett, etc) from sending targeted phishing emails which impersonated the X team to steal credentials and then launch meme coin scams. pic.twitter.com/HEWQdVICgJ — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 24, 2024 Phishing Scheme Unveiled In regards to this heist, the hackers mimicked the official emails of the X team and faked a copyright infringement to make sure the targets immediately rushed to buy the meme coins. People were enticed to go to fake pages where they were redirected to provide new passcodes for accounts, including two-factor authentication (2FA) . After the accounts were compromised, the attacker engaged in meme coin scams, correlating all 15 ATOs through a single shared deployer address. Funds stolen in these scams were then transferred across the Solana-Ethereum blockchain to make it harder for law enforcers to track down the assets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Hyperliquid Faces $500M Outflows Amidst Lazarus Group Hack Fears , Security Recommendations ZachXBT encouraged the users to rush with the account strengthening to minimise such risks. Key recommendations include: Avoid email reuse: Do not use one email address for different services. Implement strong 2FA: Use it instead of the SMS code 2FA for important accounts, resorting to a security key instead. Verify communications: Confirm the authenticity of all emails especially those in the name of official forums. It’s important that the crypto community stays on the watch and continues fighting to put an end to such activities from scammers. In particular, it aligns well with the current state of security affairs, a solid defense is the only effective means against ever-burgeoning cyber threats. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s recent surge hints at a market shift, raising speculation that altcoins like DOGEN, XRP, Solana, and Polkadot could see major gains. Table of Contents DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who play to win XRP: A borderless cryptocurrency changing seamless transactions Solana: A high-performance blockchain platform for scalable decentralized applications NEAR Protocol: A scalable platform for decentralized applications Polkadot: Enhancing blockchain communication and scalability Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent rise suggests a potential shift in the cryptocurrency market. Is this a sign that other digital coins like XRP, Solana, Near Protocol, DOGEN, and Polkadot are about to see significant gains? This article explores whether these altcoins are poised for explosive growth, following in Bitcoin’s footsteps. DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who play to win Imagine the life others can only fantasize about — sleek cars, overflowing bank accounts, and an aura that turns heads eveywhere. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle, a token that doesn’t just promise gains; it promises a movement for those who refuse to settle for mediocrity. DOGEN isn’t for the faint-hearted; it’s for true alphas who dominate every space they enter. For those ready to lead and not follow, this meme token is their chance to rewrite the rules. You might also like: ETH and FLOKI set for breakouts, DOGEN smashes records with $4M presale Unleash the beast: Hold, dominate, conquer This isn’t just another token — it’s the spark to ignite your empire. With a projected 700% surge even before the presale wraps up, DOGEN is on track to shatter records. Thousand-fold gains? That’s the terrain DOGEN is built for. The question isn’t whether someone will win; it’s whether they’ll claim their spot early enough to lead the charge. Forget regrets. This is the DOGEN era WIF, Popcat, Ponke — they had their moments, but DOGEN is the new apex predator on the Solana blockchain. As others bask in nostalgia, DOGEN is setting its sights on uncharted heights, ready to dominate the memetoken bull run like no other. Join the DOGEN army, win big, live legendary DOGEN isn’t just a token; it’s a movement. Flex a DOGEN spirit across socials, stack up during the presale, and recruit a squad with a powerful referral link. Every ally a user brings into the fold earns 20% of their Golden Points because alphas lift their pack while securing their throne. XRP: A borderless cryptocurrency changing seamless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger, designed to offer fast, low-cost, and globally accessible transactions. With its ability to process secure and irreversible payments without the need for a central authority, XRP caters to a broad range of users, including those without access to traditional banking systems. This inclusivity positions XRP as a powerful tool for financial transactions across borders. Launched by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was introduced with a fixed supply of 100 billion units. Ripple, the company originally known as OpenCoin Inc., was allocated 80 billion XRP to foster ecosystem development and enhance network liquidity. To maintain supply control, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow, releasing portions periodically. The name XRP, derived from “ripple credits,” reflects its goal of facilitating seamless payment transfers between different currencies and financial systems. Solana: A high-performance blockchain platform for scalable decentralized applications Solana is a high-speed blockchain platform designed to support the development of scalable decentralized applications (dApps). Competing with networks like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana distinguishes itself through its unique architecture, which eliminates the need for sharding or second-layer solutions. This unique design enables Solana to achieve impressive throughput, allowing developers to create robust applications using various programming languages. The platform’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, plays a vital role within its ecosystem. SOL is used for transaction fees, running custom programs, and incentivizing participants in the network. Beyond its utility, SOL holds significant value as it underpins the Solana ecosystem, powering an array of projects ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to NFT marketplaces. NEAR Protocol: A scalable platform for decentralized applications NEAR Protocol is a blockchain designed to help developers create and launch decentralized applications. It uses a sharding technology called Nightshade to improve speed and scalability. NEAR operates on a distributed network similar to centralized data storage systems but is decentralized. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, it has raised over $20 million from major venture firms. It features the Rainbow Bridge, which allows token transfers with Ethereum, and Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that uses Ethereum’s technology for better performance and lower fees. NEAR’s focus on scalability and interoperability addresses key challenges in the blockchain industry. In the current market cycle, such technologies are drawing significant interest. Polkadot: Enhancing blockchain communication and scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that allows different blockchains to communicate and share data. It lets value and information move between blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its token, DOT, is used for governance and staking, letting holders take part in network decisions and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-creator of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create a more connected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. Given its innovative approach, Polkadot’s technology has significant potential, which is noteworthy in the current market cycle. Conclusion While XRP, SOL, NEAR, and DOT show limited short-term growth, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN is poised for a 700% presale growth and possible thousand-fold returns. Following in the footsteps of BONK, WIF, and Popcat, it builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits with exclusive perks for early adopters.

Trump Administration's Cryptocurrency Policy The direction of cryptocurrency policy under the Trump administration is expected to dominate market sentiment in 2025. Proposals such as a strategic Bitcoin reserve plan and the appointment of pro-crypto officials are likely to have a direct impact on the price trends of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin. Market participants are closely following updates on these developments, which could determine whether the U.S. will take a more positive stance on crypto adoption. FED Monetary Policy The Fed’s monetary policy continues to be a major factor influencing Bitcoin prices. Historically, loose monetary policies have supported Bitcoin’s growth, while tighter policies have put downward pressure. Despite a 100 basis point rate cut this year, the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs of 10%-20% on imported goods and up to 60% on Chinese imports could increase inflationary pressures. This scenario could force the Fed to maintain higher interest rates, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s appeal as an inflation hedge. Related News: Developers on Solana Revealed the Altcoins Developers Are Most Focused on - Here's the List US Government Debt and the Safe Haven Appeal of Bitcoin The US government debt crisis is emerging as a new focal point for markets. Hasegawa notes that higher interest rates will significantly increase the government debt burden. If concerns about debt sustainability grow, especially if the strategic Bitcoin reserve plan is implemented, Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold” could grow. Such a move could strengthen Bitcoin’s safe haven status and further boost its value. *This is not investment advice.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $100K by the end of 2024 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2030, BTC might touch $270,593 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is approaching a significant milestone, with the potential to hold above $100,000. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class.

Recent news/opinions on BTC Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin may drop to $60,000 but views this as a buying opportunity, expecting it to eventually stabilize around $250K by 2025. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 Bitcoin price prediction December 2024 November was a bullish month for Bitcoin, characterized by significant upswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in December? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to surge toward $100,000 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $92K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction December 2024 $92,000 $100,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2024 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2024. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2024 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 in the highest and the low could be around $88,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 $88,000 $97,000 $105,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2025-2030 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $95,000 $120,000 $160,000 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Bitcoin Halving event’s impact is expected to last into 2025, potentially holding the Bitcoin price above the $100,000 mark. If the global economy strengthens and inflation stabilizes at 2%, interest rates could be reduced by 2025. Clearer crypto regulations could boost BTC investor confidence, leading to more buying demand amid scarcity due to halving. Following the halving event over the next 12-18 months, BTC price is expected to surge toward $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness a slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC price within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027 Based on detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year.

Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone estimates Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by 2030, attributing the increase to rising demand and BTC scarcity. Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin price to touch $120,000 by the end of 2024. Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2024, Bitcoin might record a maximum price of $105,000, with a minimum price of $88,000 and an average price of $97,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to create a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin Historical Price Sentiment BTC Price History Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000 and remained volatile with October prices fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. Early 2024 saw Bitcoin rise above $45,000 in anticipation of multiple ETF approvals, despite a brief dip below $40,000 following the ETF approval. Bitcoin’s price surged in February 2024, breaking its previous all-time high from 2021 on March 5th, reaching over $70,000 by March 8th, and setting a new high of $73,750.07 on March 14th. However, in April, the BTC price dropped below $60K. Later in May, the price of bitcoin surged and knocked the $70K level. In the weeks of June and July, BTC price witnessed heavy fluctuations as it hovered within the range of $70K-$55K. In September, the price of BTC surged toward $66K following Fed’s interest rate cut decision. In October, the price of Bitcoin faced an Uptober rally, resulting in a push toward the significant $70K resistance level. In November, the price of BTC witnessed a robust surge following Donald Trump’s victory, nearing the $100K mark.

The asset now remains below $3,500, which has turned into a key resistance line. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the price has entered a bullish phase since the beginning of November after rebounding from the $2,300 support level. However, the $4,000 resistance zone has rejected the market to the downside, with the $3,500 level also being lost. Currently, it is likely for the market to drop toward the $3,000 support zone and the 200-day moving average, located around the same price mark. As long as ETH trades above the 200-day moving average, the overall market trend can be considered bullish. Otherwise, a deeper drop toward the $2,000 area could be expected. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the market has failed to break above the $4,000 resistance level twice, forming a clear double-top pattern. With the neckline of the pattern, which is the $3,500 level, broken to the downside and the RSI showing bearish momentum, the market could correct more or even consolidate in the coming weeks before it is able to continue its upward trajectory. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio While Ethereum’s price has been struggling to continue its rally and create a new all-time high, analyzing the futures market sentiment could yield helpful insights about the potential reasons behind this correction and whether it will be over soon or not. This chart presents the Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric, which measures whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their positions more aggressively on aggregate, using market orders. As the chart suggests, the 100-day moving average of the Taker Buy Sell Ratio has been showing values below one for over a year now, with the metric currently experiencing a massive drop. This indicates that the recent correction might be due to the selling pressure coming from the futures market rather than the spot market, and as long as the metric is trending down, it will be difficult for the market to recover.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

Imagine getting in on Dogwifhat (WIF) when it debuted at mere pennies. Fast-forward to today, and early adopters are laughing their way to the bank. But while WIF’s ship may have sailed, there’s a new contender in town. This is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a presale powerhouse promising explosive gains and unparalleled community-driven opportunities. If you missed the WIF wave, don’t make the same mistake twice—BTFD’s festive 50% discount is your second chance at riding the crypto success train. The Revolutionary Rise of BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin with Utility and Community BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement that embodies the mantra of seasoned investors: Buy The Dip . Built on Ethereum for top-tier security and scalability, BTFD is designed to turn market volatility into profit. Its presale, already in its 12th stage, offers the rare opportunity to snag tokens at a rollback price of $0.000064—a massive 50.77% discount thanks to the festive promotion. Use the bonus code BIG50, and you’re all set to join over 6,500 Bulls who’ve already seized the dip. A Wealth of Opportunities for Investors BTFD’s ecosystem isn’t just about holding tokens; it’s about active growth. With a 90% APY staking program that launched on December 2, investors are earning even before the token hits major exchanges. Add in the beta launch of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which has seen a surge of community engagement, and it’s clear BTFD is poised to dominate the meme coin space. The game promises immersive challenges and in-game rewards, seamlessly connecting fun with financial growth. The Bulls Squad, an enthusiastic community of dip-chasers, adds a unique social layer to this coin. With referral rewards offering 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens for top leaderboard contributors, there’s even more incentive to spread the word. And analysts’ predictions? A jaw-dropping post-presale listing price of $0.0006, offering investors an ROI of 837.5%. Crunching the Numbers: A $3,000 Investment Example Let’s break it down. Invest $3,000 in BTFD at the Stage 12 price of $0.000064 per token, and you’ll own over 46.87 million tokens. By the presale’s end, with a projected listing price of $0.0006, your holdings could soar to $28,122. That’s the kind of return you don’t see every day. Simple Steps to Join the BTFD Movement at Huge Discount Visit the official BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Enter the bonus code BIG50 to unlock the discounted price. Input your desired purchase amount. Confirm your transaction and join the Bulls Squad. If you’ve been waiting for a sign, this is it. BTFD’s presale isn’t just a chance—it’s a strategy to get ahead before the bull market roars back to life. Dogwifhat (WIF): The One That Got Away Dogwifhat made waves earlier this year with its quirky premise and community-driven approach. Born on the Solana blockchain, WIF’s popularity exploded following its November listing on Robinhood, sparking a rally that catapulted its price to $4.85 at its peak. From its roots as a light-hearted meme coin, Dogwifhat transformed into a serious contender in the crypto space, driven by its innovative marketing—remember the Las Vegas Sphere logo stunt? The Early Wealth Generators Those who bought WIF during its crowdfunding campaign—when it was priced below $1—saw astronomical gains. A $1,000 investment back then turned into tens of thousands within months. However, like many meme coins, WIF’s high volatility caught many latecomers off guard. Its current price of $1.98 reflects a more stabilised market, but it’s clear that the biggest profits were reserved for those who got in early. The Takeaway Dogwifhat’s story is a classic case of seizing opportunities when they arise. Those who hesitated missed out on life-changing returns. While WIF remains a significant player, its best days might be behind it. For new investors looking for the next breakout star, the search leads back to BTFD Coin—an opportunity to rewrite the narrative and make the most of a Top Crypto Presale. Why BTFD Coin Is Your Next Best Bet If WIF’s rise taught us anything, it’s that timing is everything. BTFD Coin, with its robust ecosystem, community-driven incentives, and potential for massive ROI, offers a second chance for those who missed the WIF boat. The presale is designed to empower early adopters with discounted prices, high staking rewards, and an engaged community ready to take on the bull market. Act now—before the presale ends and the window closes. The dip is here, and with BTFD, it’s yours to seize. Join the Top Crypto Presale right now and become part of a movement that’s turning market dips into stepping stones to wealth. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto story.

This isn’t some random gamble. The company is making a clear statement about where it sees the future heading. But why choose Bitcoin, and what does this mean for the broader financial world? Let’s unpack it. Matador’s New Treasury Strategy Last week, digital assets attracted a massive $308 million in investments. It’s no surprise that companies like Matador are paying attention. The Canadian firm, known for turning physical assets into digital ones, just announced its plan to add Bitcoin to its treasury. This isn’t just about jumping on a crypto trend. The company’s Board of Directors approved the move unanimously, seeing it as a way to protect their cash reserves. Why? Matador says Canada’s economy is too tied to oil exports, and the rising national debt makes the Canadian dollar less reliable. To address these risks, Matador plans to invest $4.5 million in Bitcoin by the end of 2024. They’re also shifting much of their cash reserves from Canadian dollars into US dollars. It’s all part of a bigger strategy to safeguard their financial future. Why Bitcoin? For Matador, Bitcoin isn’t just another asset. They see it as a way to stay ahead in a shaky global economy. Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it resistant to inflation. That’s a big deal when traditional currencies are losing their purchasing power. And Bitcoin’s role doesn’t stop there. Matador plans to use it for their upcoming digital gold platform. Set to launch in 2025, this blockchain-based platform will allow users to buy and trade tokenized gold, with reserves stored at the Royal Canadian Mint. Bitcoin’s security and trustworthiness make it the ideal foundation for the platform. Sunny Ray, Matador’s President, sees Bitcoin as key to the company’s future. CEO Deven Soni agrees, saying it fits perfectly with Matador’s values of trust and permanence. What’s Next? Matador isn’t planning a one-time Bitcoin purchase. They’ll be buying more gradually over time. By early 2025, they’ll decide on the technology powering their digital gold platform. After that, the platform will launch, with a limited release at first. For shareholders, the company promises updates on how they’re handling their treasury and platform development. Matador’s shift isn’t just about Bitcoin—it’s about adapting to a new era in finance.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 07:18:19

The central bank of Russia is reportedly planning to create a new platform aimed at making it more difficult for shadow businesses to misuse banking services for illegal activities, including crypto-to-fiat over-the-counter platforms that bypass KYC procedures. The Bank of Russia is collaborating with the country’s financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring, banks, and local experts to create a system that would help identify and block customers involved in illegal financial transactions, Russia’s news outlet RBC reports , citing Bogdan Shablya, head of the financial monitoring and currency control service at the Bank of Russia. The platform will reportedly allow the central bank to share information about suspicious activities with financial lenders, helping them prevent illegal financial dealings. The focus is on individuals — also known as “droppers” — who offer their bank cards for money laundering or illegal activities, including transactions for drugs, online casinos, crypto exchanges/OTC services, or pirated websites. You might also like: Russia to impose regional controls over crypto mining starting Jan 2025 Centralized database Shablya explained that the central bank has already set up online monitoring systems with certain banks to track individual transactions. However, at the moment, it can only share information about “droppers” with the banks where these clients hold accounts. Since bad actors often open accounts in multiple banks, there is a need to centralize data and “share information with all credit institutions,” Shablya added. At the moment, banks do not have the authority to refuse a person an account based solely on information suggesting they may be involved in drop activities. The most a bank can currently do is open an account and block remote banking services for that account. However, these decisions are often made after suspicious transactions have already occurred, Shablya explained. The timeline for the platform’s launch is unclear, as Shablya mentioned that the issue “is still under development” and emphasized that the central bank aims to find an “acceptable solution” that addresses the problem without creating social tension or affecting honest citizens.

As a rising star in the crypto world, Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi platform is grabbing attention with its unique blend of gaming and blockchain. Rollblock is currently outshining other cryptocurrencies, leading the price jump race with its forward-thinking approach and unmatched growth potential. Rollblock offers steady increase Rollblock is emerging as a standout leader in the GambleFi space, targeting the $450 billion gambling industry with innovation and transparency. It supports over 7,000 games, live casinos, and sports betting markets, offering an unmatched experience for users. The platform’s weekly revenue-sharing model, powered by Ethereum-backed smart contracts, ensures secure and transparent transactions. During its presale, Rollblock secured $7.5 million , with RBLK tokens predicted to deliver 10x to 100x returns. Investors benefit from token burns and staking rewards, which reduce supply and promote long-term sustainability. Rewards are directly tied to the platform’s performance, making participation highly rewarding. Unlike SUI and TON , which focus on public chain applications, Rollblock brings real-world utility and unique earning opportunities. Its innovative approach and strong growth potential position Rollblock as a leader in the price jump race, making it a standout in the rapidly evolving crypto market. SUI briefly took the lead This crypto briefly surpassed TON in market cap , reaching $13.58 billion on December 21, 2024. It is currently trading at $5.50, reflecting an 2% gain in the last 24 hours. With $66.490 million in liquidity , SUI maintains strong trading activity. Known for its quick transactions and object-centric blockchain model, this crypto excels in NFT and digital asset management. Its partnership with Ant Digital aims to tokenize ESG-backed real-world assets, showcasing its potential for innovation. However, despite these gains, this crypto lacks Rollblock’s consistent investor rewards and practical use cases, which set Rollblock apart in the market. TON is resilient but lagging behind This cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $13.54 billion on December 21, 2024, is closely trailing SUI in valuation. Built on the Telegram Open Network, it focuses on secure, high-speed blockchain solutions for decentralized applications, making it a solid choice for developers. At the time of writing, TON has $23.992 million in liquidity , ensuring active trading. However, it struggled to reclaim the lead due to SUI ’s recent rise and the growing appeal. While TON offers a robust platform, it lacks Rollblock’s innovative approach and focus on the untapped potential of the gambling market, where Rollblock excels. Conclusion Each crypto brings unique strengths to the crypto market, catering to different investor needs. However, Rollblock sets itself apart with its explosive growth and tangible benefits for its community. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Rollblock delivers a blend of innovation and consistent rewards that make it a standout. With its fiery presale and forward-thinking approach, Rollblock leads the price jump race and positions itself as a top contender for success in the near future.

The analysis notes that Bitcoin’s recent correction following a 40% rally is in line with historical patterns observed in previous market cycles. Bitcoin is currently trading around 3% below its price from a month ago, with a recent high of $108,000. Corrections of 10% to 20% are common in a bull market, according to Matrixport, and often provide an ideal re-entry point for traders and investors. Related News: Developers on Solana Revealed the Altcoins Developers Are Most Focused on - Here's the List “If Bitcoin consolidates between $90,000 and $95,000, this range could represent an excellent correction zone,” Matrixport said. This range is within the -20% correction threshold, which the firm sees as a key indicator for resuming the bullish trend of the current market cycle. Matrixport predicts that maintaining the $90,000 to $95,000 consolidation range will provide a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s next phase of growth. If the price can stabilize in this range and sustain a broader uptrend, BTC could gain enough momentum for a renewed rally in 2025, the firm says. *This is not investment advice.

In just one month, it surged by 602%, reaching $0.03531, with a 13% rise in just the last 24 hours. This big jump follows the highly awaited airdrop of the Pudgy Penguins token, which has drawn lots of attention from traders and investors. Bithumb Listing Fuels PENGU’s Growth A key reason behind PENGU’s rise is its recent listing on Bithumb, one of South Korea’s top crypto exchanges. This has given the token even more exposure, helping its market cap grow to $2.2 billion . Perhaps the token’s 24-hour trading volume reached $1.54 billion, which is a 161% increase from the previous day. Although the token saw some early selling pressure, it quickly rebounded, hitting an all-time high of $0.06989 before settling around $0.03745. This surge is a clear reflection of growing investor confidence. Airdrop and Whale Activity Continues On December 24, 2024, PENGU saw another boost, rising 24% after Pudgy Penguins NFT sales jumped by 40%, reaching $1.38 million. Large whales have also been accumulating more PENGU tokens, helping to push the price higher. Recently, crypto analytics firm Lookonchain reported that one whale made a massive $8.4 million in profits in just 20 minutes by trading PENGU. Meanwhile, to keep the momentum going, Bithumb is planning an airdrop for PENGU t raders, offering 88,888,888 tokens to those who traded the tokens before December 25, 2024. The airdrop will be distributed on January 9, 2024. PENGU Price Analysis Despite its bullish movement, PENGU is facing some resistance, particularly with the continued selling pressure from early airdrop recipients. The token has dropped almost 44% from its all-time high but is still maintaining a positive trend. Key indicators show that PENGU is approaching critical resistance levels, and if it breaks through, it could see further gains, with analysts eyeing the psychological $0.04 level as the next milestone.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 07:37:32

Sensitive attendee data from crypto events is being sold online, fueling concerns about targeted phishing and social engineering attacks. Bait wallet schemes are also tricking greedy users into sending funds to multisignature wallets, ensuring scammers yield some impressive profits. Meanwhile, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies linked the $300 million theft from Japan’s DMM exchange to the North Korean TraderTraitor group, which it achieved by using very sophisticated social engineering techniques. Hackers Take Advantage of Meme Coin Hype A sophisticated phishing scam netted a threat actor close to $500,000 over the past month by targeting 15 compromised X accounts, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT . The attacker reportedly impersonated the X team, and sent fake copyright infringement notices to lure users into visiting phishing sites. These sites tricked victims into providing credentials to reset their X account passwords and disable two-factor authentication (2FA), which allowed the perpetrator to gain control of the accounts. Many of the compromised accounts were crypto-focused and included names like Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett , and Alex Blania, and they were used to promote meme coin scams. The phishing scheme involved six deployer addresses to launch various scams, with stolen funds being moved between the Solana and Ethereum networks in an attempt to obscure the source of the transactions. ZachXBT advised users to avoid reusing email addresses across services and to enable 2FA on critical accounts to boost security. The first incident was reported on Nov. 26 with RuneMine’s account, while the latest involved Kick on Dec. 24. Many of these accounts had large followings of more than 200,000 users, particularly in the meme coin community. Posts from compromised accounts often used captions like “Incoming Transmission” to announce fraudulent tokens and contract addresses. Some of the affected accounts, like the cross-chain scalability platform Neutron, have publicly acknowledged the attacks. This surge in phishing activity comes as crypto scammers seem to be trying to recover losses after phishing incidents dropped 53% month-on-month in November. However, 2024 has seen a rise in crypto theft, with blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis reporting $2.2 billion stolen across 303 major incidents—a 21% increase from the previous year. Scammers Use Bait Wallets to Trap Greedy Crypto Thieves A new crypto scam also recently emerged where fraudsters pose as inexperienced users by sharing the seed phrase of a wallet supposedly filled with funds, luring people into a trap that is designed to steal their crypto instead. According to a Dec. 23 blog post by Kaspersky analyst Mikhail Sytnik, scammers are targeting finance-related YouTube videos by posting comments with seed phrases under the guise of asking for help transferring Tether (USDT) funds. (Source: Kaspersky ) One such wallet seen by Sytnik contained $8,000 in USDT on the Tron network as bait. To transfer the funds, potential thieves would need to send Tron (TRX), the blockchain's native token, to cover network fees. However, the bait wallet is set up as a multisignature wallet requiring multiple approvals for outgoing transactions. As soon as TRX is sent to the wallet, the funds are immediately transferred to another wallet controlled by the scammers. This setup ensures that even after paying the fees, the USDT cannot be transferred by the would-be thief. Sytnik compared the scammers to digital Robin Hoods, and he advised users never to try accessing others' wallets, even if provided with a seed phrase, and to remain cautious about claims from strangers online regarding cryptocurrency. This tactic is the latest in a series of scams that are designed to exploit greed in the crypto community. In July, Kaspersky uncovered an even more elaborate scheme involving Telegram links that led victims to legitimate-looking crypto exchanges, only to infect their devices with malware capable of stealing extensive data and assets. Crypto Event Data Leaks Spark Security Concerns Meanwhile, lists containing sensitive information about crypto industry event attendees are being sold online , and are posing serious risks for targeted scams and malicious activities. These lists are marketed as tools for “marketing and promoting and finding clients,” and include personal details like names, phone numbers, nationalities, job roles, companies, and social media profiles. Some even extend to ticket purchase data, operating systems used, follower counts, crypto wallet addresses, and messages sent to event organizers. The data seems to be gathered through event registration forms, particularly at conferences and side events using platforms like lu.ma, which often require social media account links. The events primarily took place in Southeast Asia and India during the fall of 2024, which suggests an organized international trade rather than isolated incidents. Sample of one list shared One sample included a list of 1,700 attendees from the AIBC conference in Malta, initially priced at $4,000 but later reduced to $650. The seller claimed the proceeds would be used to buy more lists from events like Coinfest and DevCon. Analysis suggests that the seller and data compiler may be Russian, based on certain language clues and AI assessments of their communication. While the seller argued that the data was not sensitive and that attendees might welcome marketing efforts, cybersecurity experts still warn that this information could facilitate social engineering scams and phishing attempts. AIBC founder Eman Pulis stated that the event has strict protocols against data breaches and pointed out that fraudulent databases are common in the industry. Although the source of the data is still unclear, it is evident that these lists are in demand among bad actors. FBI Links $300M Crypto Theft to TraderTraitor Group The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), along with the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) and Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA), recently shared details about how North Korean-linked hackers stole more than $300 million from the Japanese crypto exchange DMM in May. The theft involved 4,502.9 Bitcoin, valued at close to $305 million at the time of the hack. The FBI attributed the attack to the North Korean group TraderTraitor, which uses advanced social engineering techniques. In March, a North Korean hacker posed as a recruiter on LinkedIn, targeting an employee at Ginco, a Japan-based crypto wallet company. The hacker sent a malicious GitHub link disguised as a pre-employment test, which the employee copied to their personal GitHub account, compromising their access. After using the stolen credentials, the hackers infiltrated Ginco’s communications system in May and impersonated the compromised employee. They then manipulated a legitimate transaction request made by a DMM employee, which resulted in the theft of more than $300 million in Bitcoin. The stolen funds were transferred to wallets controlled by the TraderTraitor group.",News|Security,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-25 07:42:55

However, some technical indicators are now suggesting that the asset’s real breakthrough could be just around the corner. SHIBUSD. Source: TradingView Alongside the rest of the market, the second-largest meme coin was sluggish ahead of the US elections, with its price stuck in a range of between $0.000014 and $0.00002 for weeks. Once the dust settled and Trump emerged victorious, SHIB shot up as well, going to a muli-month peak of just over $0.0003. Following a minor retracement, the asset went on the offensive once again at the start of the current month, which culminated in a surge to $0.0000335 on December 8 – its highest level since March this year. However, SHIB was not only unable to keep the momentum up and going into uncharted territory, but it actually started retracing hard in the following weeks. The most substantial price slide came after the latest US FOMC meeting during the broader market’s crash when SHIB dumped to $0.0000185. This represented a 44% slump in less than two weeks. The asset has managed to recover some ground and now sits at around $0.000023. Moreover, data from popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows that it has flashed a buy signal now. He envisioned a further rebound to $0.000029, which would represent a 25% increase from now and a 55% surge from the December 8 bottom.

That’s according to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Kiyosaki warned on Sunday, however, that the economy could plunge into a depression next year. “Global crash has started. Europe, China. USA going down. Depression ahead?” he wrote in a post on X. “Please be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money.” Global crash has started. Europe, China. USA going down . Depression ahead? Please be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money. Biggest problem are our leaders and educators. As I have often asked “What did school teach you about money?” Regardless of… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 23, 2024 And by money, the bestselling “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author means Bitcoin and gold. He’s not alone in fearing economic trouble ahead. Despite the strong GDP numbers this year, some analysts fear Trump’s aggressive trade policies could slow growth and lead to a recession. Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist for BCA Research, warned in November that Trump’s proposed import tariffs will leave the economy with a 75% chance of recession. Kiyosaki Boosts Bitcoin for Economic Meltdown Kiyosaki says all hope is not lost in a bad economy. “For many people, crashes are the best times to get rich,” he said. “I plan on getting richer. I want you to get richer and smarter, too. Take care.” Earlier this month, the financial author suggested that Bitcoin’s price could crash to $60,000 from its current levels of around $100,000. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is also worried about a massive pullback from these current highs. But Kiyosaki said he’s not selling because he expects the cryptocurrency to reach $250,000 in 2025. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 “At this stage of the BTC process… price is not as important… as how many BTC you acquire,” he said. A Booming 2025 Could Wreck Fiats Like USD Despite some recession warnings, most economists expect business to boom in 2025. Apollo Global Management’s chief economist, Torsten Sløk, projects a 0% recession forecast for the U.S. in 2025. Either way, Bitcoin could be your most important savings vehicle. According to Kiyosaki, BTC holds its value whether the economy is slowing or growing. That’s because when the economy slows, investors rush to Bitcoin as a macro hedge on future uncertainty. When the economy booms, fiat inflation soars, and as a result, so does Bitcoin’s price. “Regardless of which way economy goes, gold, silver, and Bitcoin hold their value,” Kiyosaki said.

Also, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw consecutive outflows for the fourth day as Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB continued weak performance amid holidays. Bitcoin ETFs have now recorded over $1.5 billion in outflow in last 4 days. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Sees Biggest Outflow Since Launch The crypto market showed signs of recovery as Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins rebounded over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price recovered from $94K to $99K today likely as traders FOMO Santa Claus rally. BTC currently holds above $98K, but a change in sentiment can trigger profit booking. The promising factors for the change in sentiment could come from BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which recorded its largest-ever outflow since launch on Tuesday, as per Farside Investors data on December 25. iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) witnessed $188.7 million in outflow, almost double its previous largest outflow of $72.7 million last Friday. Source: Farside Investors The total outflow from US spot Bitcoin ETFs was $338.4 million, the fourth consecutive outflow. Fidelity’s FBTC saw $83.2 million and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB recorded $75 million in outflows. The flows for other crypto exchange-traded funds were negligible. This has raised concerns among traders, raising problems for them as the year-end crypto expiry is almost here. While analysts and investors are primarily bullish, the recent prediction by experts including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes about a potential crypto market crash near Donald Trump’s inauguration day sparked sell-offs. However, crypto firms such as MicroStrategy, Metaplanet , Matador Technologies, and others buy the Bitcoin price dip. In fact, MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor announced a special shareholder meeting to vote on a proposal for its 21/21 Bitcoin plan and boost its treasury. What’s Next for Bitcoin Price? BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s largest-ever outflow and consecutive outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs made investors to think about their next move. Crypto analyst Skew revealed that the current passive ask liquidity is around $100K given quoting and previous LTF high, which is an important price area. Besides, ask liquidity and spot supply is around $105K. He believes flows and volatility will be a key factor here. “Dynamic use of taker & limit bid for acquiring BTC here, likely a strategic play by some large market entity that expects higher prices into year end & early Q1.” BTC price jumped 4% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $98,014. The 24-hour low and high are $93,744 and $99,404, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has decreased by 24% in the last 24 hours, indicating a decline in interest among traders. Traders must keep an eye on volume and sentiment in the market for cues on direction in upcoming days, with BlackRock Bitcoin ETF also a major factor. Notably, 147 BTC options with $14.40 billion in notional value to expire on Deribit this Friday.

Meanwhile, Toncoin has attracted attention with positive recovery signs, and analysts are optimistic about Polkadot’s future price movements. This exciting momentum across major cryptocurrencies presents a prime opportunity for investors to engage with some of the most promising projects in the digital finance space today. Toncoin (TON) Holders Redirect Their Funds to Remittix Toncoin presents an exciting opportunity for savvy investors to buy low and position themselves for potential gains. Once celebrated as one of the year’s standout performers, Toncoin faced a dramatic decline following Pavel Durov’s arrest in August. However, the token shows early signs of a rebound, suggesting it could regain its footing. This has fueled optimism for Toncoin’s recovery. Even though the token’s value has fallen considerably, this downturn might be the time for investors to get in at a bargain price. Analysts think that Toncoin could be among the fastest cryptocurrencies to grow in 2025, making its low price an attractive entry point. Despite its promise, Toncoin faces challenges as investor sentiment has soured on platforms like CoinMarketCap. Over the past month, the token has shed 7.25% of its value. A closer look at the past week reveals an even steeper 21.52% decline. These numbers paint a grim picture, prompting many to reconsider their positions. Some investors, discouraged by Toncoin’s bearish trajectory, redirect their funds to promising prospects like Remittix. Polkadot (DOT) Teams Up With Velocity Labs to Establish Magic Ramp Polkadot has struggled this year; experts blame volatility for the poor price performance. However, the tide changed in the year’s final quarter, as DOT posted a 100% gain. A sharp correction then followed, cutting its value by over 30%. Despite this setback, Polkadot’s ecosystem remains alive and well-represented by the Polkadot Relay Chain, which processes 32 million monthly transactions. In a new development, Velocity Labs partnered with Harbors to provide “Magic Ramp,” a stablecoin payment method. This innovation links Polkadot’s blockchain to SEPA Instant payment rails, unlocking low-cost and efficient payment solutions. Magic Ramp allows seamless transactions between euros and USDC within 30 seconds, bridging traditional financial systems with Web3 technology. This collaboration also enables developers to connect the Polkadot Asset Hub to SEPA Instant payment rails in Europe. Remittix Focuses On Fiat & Crypto To Outperform Competitors Remittix (RTX) is a crypto protocol transforming global finance with its innovative PayFi protocol, offering seamless solutions for individuals and businesses. Unlike platforms like Stripe, Wise, or Coinbase, which focus solely on fiat or crypto, Remittix effortlessly bridges both worlds. This protocol allows users to convert over 50 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and send cash directly to any global bank account. This simplifies transactions, making them straightforward, efficient, and cost-effective. Remittix provides businesses with groundbreaking tools to streamline operations. The Remittix Pay API enables businesses to accept crypto payments while automatically settling them in fiat directly into designated bank accounts. Merchant accounts can also be established, giving businesses full control over cash-out preferences. Businesses have access to 30+ fiat currencies and over fifty cryptocurrency pairs, allowing for unprecedented flexibility and efficiency in managing their finances. The core of Remittix’s ecosystem is the $RTX token. $RTX holders have governance rights to shape its development and can stake their tokens to generate as much as 20% APY. To ensure trust and security, $RTX has undergone rigorous audits by SolidProof and BlockSAFU. The team has locked tokens and the liquidity pool for three years, showcasing their commitment to long-term stability and investor confidence. The $RTX token sells in its presale phase for $0.0156, causing considerable buzz in the crypto community with many believing the price will never reach these low levels again. Experts predict a 900% increase in presale and a 5,000% increase upon listing on centralized and decentralized platforms. Remittix isn’t simply enhancing payment systems—it is altering how individuals and companies send cash all over the globe.

Pseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse tells his 251,400 followers on the social media platform X that he believes the doors are open for Bitcoin and altcoins to spark surges. “The window of opportunity is between now and the second week of January for things to pop.” The analyst’s outlook stems from the idea that traders believe the incoming Donald Trump presidential administration will be incredibly bullish for crypto. Trump has signaled that under his administration, the US government’s anti-crypto agenda would end, and he has even suggested a Bitcoin treasury to help get the country’s finances in order. But the analyst highlights that his predicted window for crypto rallies will close just days before Trump’s inauguration. He argues that traders will likely be in for a rude awakening after Trump takes over the White House on January 20th, 2025 “The market had to some degree priced in a most fairytale scenario – one where the United States establishes a Bitcoin reserve and Lummis’s bill passes smoothly. However, as reality sets in, that optimistic positioning will likely fade, especially as it becomes clear that Trump will encounter significant resistance in pushing many of his initiatives through. This is a good thing.” The analyst also warns that he thinks crypto will print a local top around the time Trump officially begins his second term as US president. “Like I see no one open to the idea that we are very close (weeks to a quarter) to a nice top. Just people under the impression that because of Trump the markets have to go up.” Looking at the macro landscape, The Flow Horse says capital is still expensive compared to the 2020 cycle when the Fed was forced to drop interest rates close to zero due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “If you believe this cycle will surpass the previous one wildly, you should have a clear thesis explaining how it achieves this without the support of the robust credit markets that helped the prior.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,455.

Will the BTC price rise and form a new ATH before the end of 2024? The market participants remained vigilant over the crypto markets, specifically the Bitcoin price rally, as they tend to look out for these answers. While the market volatility varied, the star token had failed to gain the required buying pressure. However, the latest rise suggests the bulls tried hard to reclaim the $100K spot but the bears, who seem to have capitulated to these levels, prevented the token from doing so. Now that the token displayed a Christmas rally, the year-end rise is expected to revive a strong rise, marking new highs. While the BTC price displayed uncertainty, the spot ETFs witnessed a massive sell-off. BlackRock sold over $188 million worth of BTC, which is one of their biggest sell-offs since the start.Besdies, the total sell-offs also marked the peak of over $338 million but the price recovered from $94,000 to $99,000. Regardless of this, BlackRock and Fidelity collectively hold over $50 billion in Bitcoin, which could keep up the bullish hopes over the rally. The BTC price in the short term suggests the price may be subject to a small pullback as the stochastic RSI has reached the oversold levels. Hence, the levels are about to drop and after a bullish crossover, the DMI levels are close to undergoing a bearish crossover. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is expected to undergo a small pullback and drop below $96,000 in the next couple of days. However, this pullback could be an opportunity to accumulate at the lower range. The crypto markets are heading towards the end of the year, which usually attracts a good buying volume. However, the volume over the platform remains lower, which suggests the bullish participation remains restrictive at the moment. Hence, a rise in the volume is expected to trigger the volatility, which is much required for a healthy bullish close for the year, probably above $100K.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 08:09:13

Analyst Timothy Peterson Reveals,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-a-new-years-rally-coming-for-bitcoin-analyst-timothy-peterson-reveals/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Timothy Peterson predicted a potential “Santa rally” for Bitcoin in a Twitter post, citing three key indicators. Peterson cited historical trends, market seasonality, and the performance of the US dollar as factors that point to a strong Bitcoin rally during the holiday season. Dollar’s Weakening Momentum: The analyst noted that the US Dollar Index (DXY) is approaching a recent high and there is an 85% chance it will reverse soon. Historically, a declining dollar has an inverse relationship with Bitcoin, as declining global demand for the USD often pushes investors toward alternatives like cryptocurrencies. “A weaker dollar is often associated with stronger Bitcoin performance,” Peterson said. Related News: Developers on Solana Revealed the Altcoins Developers Are Most Focused on - Here's the List Bitcoin Seasonal Resistance: The analyst said that Bitcoin has historically performed positively in the last week of December. Data shows that Bitcoin tends to perform well from December 25 to January 2, with exceptions being both rare and mild. Peterson also noted that since 2015, Bitcoin has gained in November 100% of the time, and has also gained in December. This trend could see Bitcoin perform an average of 10% in December, pushing its price to $106,000 by the end of the year. Historical Cycle Examples: Peterson drew parallels with the 2016 and 2020 bull market cycles, stating that Bitcoin’s current price trajectory closely mirrors those periods. He suggested that Bitcoin is poised for a significant upward move consistent with the “January effect,” where markets typically see renewed buying interest following year-end tax losses. *This is not investment advice.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $6.01 by the end of 2027. By 2030, XTZ’s price may surge to $18.90. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. As the current market sentiments are largely bullish, many crypto enthusiasts are asking questions like, “Can the Tezos token hit $100 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.43 Market cap $1,438,984,350.61 Trading volume $180,482,416.52 Circulating supply 1,019,238,752.5 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $1.35 24-hour high $1.46 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $1.821 (27.87%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.56% 50-day SMA $1.187 14-Day RSI 52.65 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.834 Tezos price analysis: XTZ shows signs of uptrend TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has seen a 1.28% decline in the last 24 hours. XTZ support is $1.33, and resistance is $1.47. The broader trend remains bullish despite recent declines. On December 25, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $1.416. Resistance stands at $1.477, while support is at $1.335. Holding above the key support level is crucial to prevent a deeper pullback toward $1.193. Despite recent consolidation, XTZ remains in a recovery phase and could target higher levels if buyers sustain momentum, with a potential upside beyond the $1.50 mark. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ remains above the SMA at $1.331 The 1-day chart for XTZ indicates slight bearish pressure, with the price currently down 1.28%. The token remains above the SMA at $1.331, suggesting that the broader trend remains bullish despite recent declines. XTZ remains above the SMA at $1.331 The RSI is at 52.69, indicating neutral conditions but showing a slight downward trajectory, hinting at waning momentum. Also, the MACD is slightly above the signal line, but the negative histogram reflects mild bearish momentum. Key support lies near $1.33; failure to hold this level could push XTZ toward lower support levels. On the upside, resistance is seen near $1.50, and a break above this could reinvigorate the bullish momentum. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ is approaching the upper Bollinger Band at $1.477 The 4-hour chart for XTZ shows mild bullish momentum. XTZ is approaching the upper Bollinger Band at $1.477, signalling potential resistance. The lower Bollinger Band at $1.193 represents the next significant support zone. XTZ is approaching the upper Bollinger Band at $1.477 The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.97 indicates strong bullish control, suggesting buyers actively drive higher prices. However, the proximity to the upper Bollinger Band may limit the immediate upside unless there is significant buying volume. If XTZ breaks above $1.477, it could target higher resistance levels near $1.50. On the downside, a failure to maintain momentum could result in a pullback toward the basis level at $1.335 or further to $1.193.

XTZ is trading at $1.416, with resistance at $1.477 and support at $1.335. A breakout above $1.477 could target $1.50, while failure may lead to a pullback to $1.335 or $1.193. Traders should watch out for consolidation or a potential breakout soon. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as it is currently on a dip, and the prospects look good. Once the bull market returns to full swing, Tezos’ price will likely soar upwards. The platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up due to recent network upgrades, increased adoption in gaming and NFTs, and attractive staking rewards, which have boosted investor confidence and market activity. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will hit $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. At that point, we will see old investors cutting their losses and new investors taking profits aggressively. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 by 2030. To reach that point, a huge market cap will be required. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Do Kwon , founder of Terraform Labs , has lost his appeal in Montenegro’s Constitutional Court, which he had filed to reconsider its decision on his extradition, the Korea JoongAng Daily has learned . The ruling means that Kwon’s case will now be decided by Montenegro’s justice minister, who will determine whether Kwon will be sent to the United States or South Korea for trial. Kwon is wanted in both countries. In the U.S., he faces charges related to the crash of his failed algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD ( USTC ) and token Luna ( LUNA ), in May 2022. In South Korea, he is also facing legal issues. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, when he was trying to board a private flight to the UAE with fake documents.

However, everything collapsed in May 2022, just months after the crypto market peaked in late 2021, resulting in $60 billion in losses for both retail and institutional investors. As the crypto industry struggled with bankruptcies, Kwon fled from authorities. Companies like Three Arrows Capital and FTX went bankrupt due to a major liquidity crisis, while Kwon escaped to Europe. After an Interpol red notice and global attention, Kwon was caught in Montenegro’s capital, Podgorica. Kwon’s company, Terraform Labs, agreed to a record $4.47 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after a jury found it guilty of defrauding crypto investors.

If approved, FLOKI would be the only meme token other than dogecoin (DOGE) with an institutional product in Europe. “We've been actively working with a respected Asset Manager and an ETP Issuer to launch a Floki ETP (Exchange-Traded Product) for quite a while now, and after months of due diligence and painstaking effort, we've been told that the Floki ETP is on track to go live in early Q1, 2025,” lead developer B told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Wednesday. The developers as seeking approval from the Floki DAO community to provide early liquidity to the product when it goes live. The vote runs for 48 hours and will end at 11:00 UTC on Dec. 27. They are seeking approval to allocate part of the FLOKI required for the ETP from a treasury wallet that holds 16 billion tokens, worth just over $2.8 million at current prices. Tokens in that wallet were purchased from the open market over three years after the passage of another community vote. If the proposal is approved, the FLOKI tokens would provide liquidity for the ETP while remaining Floki's property and could be withdrawn if there is enough third-party liquidity in the ETP. “The Floki ETP is currently in an advanced stage and will become tradable on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Switzerland and the third-largest in Europe,” B said. “When it goes live, the Floki ETP will allow institutional investors, regulated entities and retail investors to get exposure to FLOKI in a regulated way.” B said the team could not disclose further specifics about the ETP due to non-disclosure agreements, such as opening prices, fund structure and institutional partners.

While Cardano (ADA) targets a price of $3 and Ethereum (ETH) eyes an ambitious $5,000, the real buzz surrounds Lightchain AI (LCAI) and its groundbreaking presale. With projections of an astonishing 25,305% return by 2025, the Lightchain AI Presale is capturing attention like never before. Each of these coins offers unique value propositions: Cardano’s methodical development, Ethereum’s dominance in smart contracts, and LCAI’s game-changing fusion of AI and blockchain. The big question remains Which one will deliver the highest returns in the coming years? Cardano (ADA) Aiming for Sustainable Growth to $3 Cardano has got its name by hard work, checked by others and a steady plan that focuses on growth, working together, and lasting change. Its Proof of Stake way of agreeing makes energy use good and cuts down costs for deals more than old leaders like Bitcoin. With coming Hydra growth fixes, Cardano may boost flow a lot, making DeFi and NFT uses easier for more folks to get. Also, its strong system growth, helped by a loyal group and smart links, pushes steady ADA use, adding to slow but real price rise. While a $3 goal for ADA may not be as striking as LCAI’s guesses, Cardano’s careful steps give a steady, low-risk choic͏e that attracts more cautious investors. Ethereum (ETH) Pushing the Boundaries Toward $5,000 Ethereum remains the leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. Its transition to Proof of Stake has significantly improved energy efficiency, while Layer-2 solutions and The Merge upgrades are addressing network congestion and high fees. Ethereum’s dominance in the DeFi space ensures sustained demand for ETH, as it hosts the majority of these platforms. Additionally, its versatility—ranging from NFTs to enterprise solutions—continues to drive long-term growth. While reaching $5,000 would be a major milestone, Ethereum faces tough competition from newer, faster blockchains and must continue to innovate to maintain its position at the forefront of the industry. Lightchain AI (LCAI) AI-Driven Challenger Targeting 25,305% Returns Lightchain AI (LCAI) arrives on the scene with a bold vision integrating artificial intelligence directly into its blockchain architecture. Priced at just $0.003 in its presale, LCAI aims to revolutionize decentralized applications by enabling developers to deploy AI-powered dApps through the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Why LCAI’s Potential Is So Explosive Transparent AI Framework This framework ensures that all AI decision-making processes within the platform are fully transparent and auditable, fostering confidence among users and developers. Decentralized Governance Integration Lightchain AI incorporates decentralized governance with AI capabilities to enable more intelligent, community-driven decision-making. Scalability and Efficiency The platform’s architecture is built for high scalability, allowing it to efficiently handle large volumes of transactions and AI computations, making it adaptable to a wide range of industries. Privacy and Security Lightchain AI prioritizes data privacy and security, ensuring that AI computations and data handling adhere to stringent privacy standards, which is particularly vital for industries such as healthcare and finance. With projections of a 25,305% increase by 2025 (potentially turning $300 into over $75,000), LCAI caters to those seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Evaluating the Options Stability vs. Innovation vs. Exponential Growth Deciding which token to back depends on an investor’s risk tolerance, time horizon, and belief in emerging technologies. Cardano (ADA) is ideal for those who prefer a slow-and-steady approach, focusing on moderate but consistent returns and a commitment to technological rigor. Ethereum (ETH) provides broad exposure to the well-established core of DeFi and NFTs, offering significant yet comparatively measured growth potential. On the other hand, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, appealing to early adopters looking to invest in a transformative project at ground-floor prices. Race to 2025 As we look toward 2025, the crypto landscape will likely look very different. Cardano may have solidified its position among top-tier chains, Ethereum may have cemented its dominance with $5,000 in sight, and Lightchain AI could prove to be the dark horse that outpaces both in terms of raw returns. While predictions must always be taken with caution, the fundamental trends—Cardano’s consistent development, Ethereum’s vast ecosystem, and LCAI’s pioneering integration of AI—will shape their future trajectories. For investors willing to mix stability, established dominance, and wild potential gains, these three coins offer a snapshot of where the crypto world might be headed in the next bull run.

While Bitcoin sets the pace for the market, cryptocurrencies like Stellar ( XLM ), Hedera ( HBAR ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Algorand ( ALGO ) are carving out their niches with their use cases and growing adoption. Trading under $1, these altcoins stand out for their partnerships and growing utility making them intriguing prospects for investors looking to diversify in 2025. STELLAR (XLM) Stellar Lumens is gaining recognition as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies under $1, strengthened by institutional backing and its role in cross-border payments. Grayscale Investments LLC’s Stellar Lumens Trust recently posted a 10% increase in net assets for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. This growth, linked to the addition of 34,875,230 XLM tokens valued at $3,923, has reignited interest in Stellar, driving a recent price spike. Founded by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb, Stellar has established itself as a key solution for global money transfers, strengthened by partnerships with platforms like Félix and Bitso, which shows its real-world utility. Stellar’s price movements have historically mirrored Ripple ( XRP ), offering another layer of potential upside. Ripple’s latest development, including the RLUSD launch, has analysts forecasting a bullish trajectory, with some suggesting XRP could reach $5 or higher. Given their overlapping use cases in cross-border payments, Stellar appears well-positioned to capitalize on Ripple’s momentum. XLM one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently priced at $0.39, Stellar has faced a 28% decline over the past month but boasts a 199% year-to-date (YTD) gain, highlighting its potential for significant returns. With strong institutional support, strategic partnerships, and robust fundamentals, Stellar stands out as a cryptocurrency to watch closely as 2025 approaches. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera (HBAR) has strengthened its position in the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) space through a partnership with Chainlink ( LINK ). The collaboration integrates Chainlink’s Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve mechanisms into Hedera, allowing developers to access tamper-proof market data critical for building decentralized applications and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This initiative addresses long-standing risks, such as data manipulation, while enhancing liquidity and risk management across DeFi platforms, thereby boosting Hedera’s utility. HBAR one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently trading at $0.31, HBAR has achieved a one-month gain of 113% and a year-to-date increase of 261%, reflecting growing market confidence. Adding to its appeal, Bloomberg analysts have identified Hedera as a strong candidate for ETF approval, citing its regulatory compliance and classification outside the realm of securities. The potential departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the possible appointment of pro-crypto Paul Atkins could further ease regulatory pathways for digital assets like HBAR. With a combination of technological advancements and the prospect of ETF inclusion, Hedera is positioning itself as a leading asset for investors seeking high-growth opportunities in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE continues to capture attention as one of the most volatile yet intriguing cryptocurrencies, bolstered by its cultural significance and recent political ties. The incoming Trump administration, widely considered the most crypto-friendly in U.S. history, has sparked renewed interest in Dogecoin. With Elon Musk, a long-time advocate of the token, now heading the newly established “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.), Dogecoin has found itself indirectly linked to significant political narratives. While the agency’s primary focus is reducing government spending, the indirect connection to Dogecoin has further fueled speculation in the meme coin market. DOGE one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently trading at $0.33, Dogecoin has seen a one-month decline of 23%, reflecting its notorious volatility. However, it remains up an impressive 271% year-to-date, highlighting its ability to deliver substantial short-term gains. While its price movements often defy conventional market logic, investors should approach it cautiously. The potential for another speculative rally exists, especially under a pro-crypto administration, but the token’s history suggests that such gains may be short-lived. As a result, Dogecoin represents both an opportunity and a risk, making it a speculative bet for 2025 rather than a stable investment. Algorand (ALGO) Algorand is increasingly becoming a cryptocurrency to watch for 2025 due to its growing presence in DeFi and non-fungible token ( NFT ) applications. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Algorand’s ecosystem rose significantly from $117 million in November to $160 million as of December 24, showcasing its expanding utility and adoption in blockchain-based solutions. Currently trading at $0.39, Algorand has recorded a 33% gain over the past month and a 73% increase year-to-date. These gains highlight strong market interest and confidence in its long-term potential. ALGO one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Derivatives data from CoinGlass also supports Algorand’s momentum, with open interest increasing by 0.92% to $96.11 million, indicating growing activity in futures and options markets. Additionally, the weighted funding rate, long/short ratios, and rekt statistics suggest heightened trading interest, reflecting broader optimism for the asset. These factors position ALGO as a key cryptocurrency for investors to monitor as the digital asset space evolves in 2025. While these altcoins come with varying degrees of risk, their potential to leverage market trends and ecosystem partnerships positions them as strong candidates for investors seeking diversification and higher returns in 2025. However, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and prices can fluctuate unpredictably.

While this regulation was published in the official gazette today, new obligations were imposed on cryptocurrency exchanges. Accordingly, exchanges will now have to constantly monitor their transactions and customers. In addition, controls on cryptocurrency transfers have been increased and exchanges have been required to verify their identities for transactions of 15 thousand TL and above. Accordingly, comprehensive identity verification has been made mandatory for cryptocurrency transfers exceeding 15 thousand TL. In this context, the sender will have to present their name, surname, trade registry information, wallet address, and citizenship or passport number. In transfers between exchanges, if the exchange receiving the transaction cannot confirm the sender's information, it may categorize the crypto transfer as risky and send it back. “If sufficient information cannot be obtained, consideration will be given to not performing the transfer, limiting transactions with the financial institution in question, or terminating the business relationship.” It was stated that the new regulation aims to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. These new regulations are planned to come into force on February 25, 2025. It was stated that these comprehensive changes aim to make the cryptocurrency market more transparent and secure. *This is not investment advice.

This bullish formation has fueled predictions that Ethereum could rally to $12,000 soon, marking a new all-time high for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum Price Targets $12 With New Chart Pattern In a Tuesday X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst Tony Severino released an Ethereum price chart illustrating an inverse head and shoulder, a technical analysis indicator signaling a potential trend reversal. This distinctive chart pattern has four key components: a left shoulder, head, right shoulder, and neckline. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Typically, when the pattern is completely formed, and a cryptocurrency breaks through the neckline, it indicates a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. In Ethereum’s case, its price has been on a significant downward trajectory, declining by over 8% in the past week. Despite dropping from a price high of over $4,000 to below $3,500 recently, Severino remains optimistic about Ethereum’s potential for a trend reversal, predicting a bullish price target of $12,000 for the top altcoin. Examining the analyst’s price chart, the left shoulder of the inverse head and shoulder was formed in 2021, while the head emerged during Ethereum’s price crash at the end of 2022, marking the lowest point in the pattern. Additionally, the right shoulder of the inverse head and shoulder pattern is complete, with Ethereum recently testing the neckline — a key resistance level by a horizontal trendline. At the time, Ethereum broke above $3,400, confirming the bullish trend reversal often associated with this chart pattern. Looking at the price chart, the distance between the head and the neckline measures approximately 265.84%, suggesting that Ethereum could rally between $10,000 and $12,000 if the pattern plays out as expected. The upward-sloping channel of the inverse head and shoulder further supports this bullish trend outlook, with Severino’s Ethereum price target likely aligning with the channel’s trajectory. Ethereum Whale Accumulation Trend Skyrockets While the Ethereum price is trading at $3,493 after surging by 2.3% in the past 24 hours, an analyst known as ‘Mister Crypto’ revealed that whales have been on a major buying spree. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Recover To $107,000 Again If This Important Level Is Broken The analyst shared a chart illustrating Ethereum’s balance on accumulation addresses. He disclosed that Ethereum whales are purchasing ETH tokens exponentially, steadily increasing their holdings since 2017. The sharp rise in accumulation suggests that investors are potentially positioning themselves ahead of a bullish price action. The red arrow in the analyst’s chart also shows a major spike in the ETH balance on accumulation addresses in recent months. Most wallets associated with this surging accumulation have seen minor outflows, signaling long-term holding behavior by investors.

These transactions allow users to unlock rewards and level up faster, and many users have been known to spend high amounts on these achievements. This teenager is not the first to spend a big chunk of money on Monopoly GO. Previously, another user also reported spending $1,000 on the game before removing it. However, even that case is only a small fraction of what this teenager spent recently on the free-to-play game, as discovered by the parents. Deleted Reddit comment of a parent complaining about their child’s Monopoly GO in-app spending. Source: Reddit In a deleted Reddit post, the parent of a 17-year-old shared that their daughter had spent $25,000 without consent on over 368 purchases in Monopoly GO through the App Store. The parent seemed concerned and looking to find “who to write to” and was hoping for a return. The comment section didn’t bring any good news for the parents, as Monopoly GO’s terms and conditions hold the user responsible for any payment made, whether intentional or not.

The recent Monopoly GO case by the teenager won’t reach any positive conclusion, especially one that the parent receives any returns on the unauthorized transactions. However, it does raise concerns about the nature of in-app spending, especially in games that underaged players can access. It’s not difficult to understand why the gaming industry prefers this model, as it generates high revenues for the publishers. For example, Diablo 4 brought in 150 million from player micro-transactions. The information is publicly shared in the LinkedIn profile of the game’s Senior Product Manager. He detailed his work on Diablo 4 monetization, which includes bundles and discounts that reportedly brought in $150 million. It also works because players tend to consent to smaller payments more easily, which eventually becomes a regular expense. Still, gamers consider micro-transactions within apps misleading and often criticize them.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

Coinbase Hits New High with $119 Billion in Weekly Trading Volume This represents a 124% increase over the previous week's total and a staggering 164% increase in daily averages. For comparison, the platform’s daily trading volume averaged just $2.5 billion during November, with a sharp increase in December, with daily averages approaching $10 billion. Dominance of BTC and ETH Trading Pairs The top five trading pairs – BTC-PERP, ETH-PERP, SOL-PERP, XRP-PERP, and DOGE-PERP – accounted for 99.8% of the exchange’s weekly volume. BTC-PERP alone contributed 57%, followed by ETH-PERP with 34%. This reflects the platform’s focus on institutional clients outside the US, where Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the most sought-after assets.

All six will start operations on the same day, Dec. 31, a condition imposed by the regulator, Calcalist said. Final approval for the funds was granted last week. The funds will be offered by Migdal Capital Markets, More, Ayalon, Phoenix Investment, Meitav and IBI, with management fees ranging from as high as 1.5% to 0.25%. One of the funds will be actively managed, trying to beat bitcon's performance. They will initially transact just once a day , though future products will be able to trade continuously, Globes said in a Tuesday report, citing market sources. The ISA's approval comes almost a year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world's largest economy, during which the world's largest cryptocurrency has more than doubled to trade near a record high. The U.S. funds have gathered a net $35.6 billion of investor cash.

The ChatGPT maker is considering building human-like robots which could be a major coup in artificial intelligence-powered robotics. However, this development comes after Elon Musk’s Tesla recently showcased its Optimus robots. The AI giant used to operate a robotics division when it first appeared on the scene. However, it scrapped it in 2021. Co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that the division was closed due to a lack of training data for advancing intelligence systems. Times have changed for the IOT world after several major breakthroughs in AI systems and hardware over the last few years. OpenAI’s robotic comeback OpenAI is playing catch-up in a competitive space dominated by players like Boston Dynamics and Tesla. It has invested in robotics startups like Figure AI, 1X Technologies, and Physical Intelligence. After bagging positive results in the AI sector, the company seems to be focusing on integrating GPT models into robots. According to the report , OpenAI is discussing humanoid robot development. While no roadmap has been confirmed so far, the company recently posted job listings for robotics research. It is looking for engineers to train multimodal AI models to “unlock new capabilities” for partner robots. If the AI giant builds its own humanoid robots, it will enter a fiercely competitive arena. Tesla’s Optimus and Boston Dynamics’ bots are already making waves. Earlier, OpenAI rolled out its ChatGPT Search feature to all free users, enabling real-time web data fetching. Initially available to paid subscribers, it lets ChatGPT access live information by tapping a globe icon, making it more interactive and up-to-date. It is also adding maps and a “Search with Advanced Voice” feature Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus At the We, Robot event, Tesla stole the show not once but twice. First, it showcased the futuristic Cybercab, and second, with an update on the Optimus humanoid robot. Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous taxi with no steering wheel and no pedals is expected to start production in 2026. Elon Musk also made the ambitious promise of cheaper rides than mass transit. Tesla’s Optimus turned out to be the showstopper of the event. Elon Musk even said, “It can do anything.” Babysit, mow your lawn, walk your dog, even serve drinks. “The Optimus will walk amongst you,” he declared. Priced between $20K-$30K, Tesla’s CEO claims that Optimus will be the “most significant product ever created.” He even thinks all 8 billion humans will want one. Optimus Gen 2 was introduced in December 2023 and it looked like it has evolved fast. The robot is able to fold shirts, walk better, and have tactile sensors for precise tasks. Meanwhile, Tesla first teased the Optimus concept back in 2021 during AI Day. Fast forward, and Gen 2 is showcasing real progress, from folding clothes to watering plants.

The king crypto Bitcoin went up from $94K to $99K which is seen as a “ Santa Claus rally ,” but it could also be a profit-taking shift. BTC is currently holding above $98K , but traders are cautious as year-end expiry approaches. In the meanwhile, current savior ETFs are also taking a toll by losing $1.4B within 4 days. ETFs in January this year have given an instant boost to the dull market however the assets lost their charm mid-way but analysts are positive that they will revive soon. With ETH ETF inflow, is the market showing signs of an early altcoin rally? Let’s dive in! US Spot BTC ETFs Are Bleeding BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), saw a record outflow of $188.7 million on Christmas Eve, marking its largest single-day outflow. This was part of a larger trend, with Bitcoin funds losing $1.5 billion over four days (Dec. 19–24). Other Bitcoin ETFs, including those from Fidelity and ARK 21Shares, also saw significant outflows, while Bitwise Bitcoin ETFs were the only ones to record an inflow. Altcoins Take the Lead In the meanwhile ETH ETFs are moving slowly and steadily with rising traders’ interest in altcoins , with Bitcoin’s role in the market weakening slightly. In the downtrend, Ether funds saw $53.6 million in inflows, followed by a $130.8 million inflow the previous day. Despite a slow start this year, analysts speculate that Ether may outperform Bitcoin in January 2025 , as the ETH/BTC ratio shows strength. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Angel Investor Warn Against MicroStrategy Buying Too Much Bitcoin , What’s Next for Bitcoin?

The scheme targeted investors in Solana-based meme coins and has resulted in an estimated loss of $500,000. Solana Meme Coin Fraud The Blockchain detective revealed in a December 24 social media post that the operation involved impersonating the X team and leveraging phishing websites to gain unauthorized access to high-profile accounts. The attackers used fake copyright infringement notices to create a sense of urgency, tricking account holders into visiting phishing websites. These sites prompted users to reset their two-factor authentication (2FA) or passwords. Once credentials were obtained, the hackers used the compromised accounts to push scams targeting meme coin enthusiasts. Each compromised account shared a specific contract address tied to fraudulent Solana tokens, urging followers to invest using SOL. Posts often featured the caption “Incoming Transmission,” followed by a token announcement and contract details. The cybercriminals also attempted to obscure their operations by bridging stolen funds between the Solana and Ethereum networks. However, ZachXBT’s investigation uncovered that all the hacked accounts were linked through six deployer addresses used for the scams. The scheme exploited the trust and large audiences of crypto-focused accounts, many of which had over 200,000 followers. Prominent ones affected included Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett, and Alex Blania, with the first reported incident occurring on November 26 involving RuneMine, while the most recent was Kick on December 24. Growing Threats to Social Media Platforms This attack is not an isolated incident but part of a broader social media platform exploitation trend by threat actors. X, a hub for crypto projects and creators, has increasingly been targeted for its prominence within the community. In a similar investigation in November, ZachXBT exposed several account takeovers on X and Instagram, which fueled pump-and-dump schemes tied to meme coins. Victims reportedly lost over $3.5 million during this spree, which began in August 2024. The pattern of these attacks remains consistent: accounts are breached, fraudulent tokens are promoted, and the proceeds are funneled into anonymous wallets. Notable examples include the hacking of Symbiotic’s X account in October, where phishing links disguised as airdrop checklists led to tokens being stolen. EigenLayer’s account was hijacked that month to promote a fake airdrop campaign. Truth Terminal AI founder Andy Ayrey’s account was also used to promote fraudulent meme coins, netting the hacker $1.5 million.

Cardano (ADA) remains stuck in a bearish phase, trading within a narrow range of $0.87 to $1.00.

By late 2024, the number of crypto investors surged to 15.59 million , marking a record in the country’s history. This rapid growth highlights the increasing prominence of digital assets in South Korea’s financial landscape. In November, the daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies hit $10.5 billion, rivaling the combined activity of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ stock markets. The data, sourced from the country’s five largest cryptocurrency exchanges—Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax—demonstrates the growing significance of digital assets. The government, in response, may need to focus on creating a safer trading environment, protecting investor rights, and stabilizing the market. Representative Lim Gwang-hyun of the Democratic Party, who serves on the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee, revealed data from the Bank of Korea showing a sharp rise in crypto investors. The 15.59 million investors account for 30% of South Korea’s population , which stands at approximately 51.23 million. In just one month, between October and November, the investor count grew by 610,000. The total value of digital assets held by South Korean investors soared to $70.3 billion (102.6 trillion KRW) by late November, compared to $39.7 billion (58 trillion KRW) in October. Meanwhile, funds deposited on exchanges, awaiting investment, rose from $3.2 billion (4.7 trillion KRW) in October to $6.03 billion (8.8 trillion KRW) by November’s end. The surge in trading activity was driven largely by altcoins, which now account for 88% of trades. Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, dominates the market with an impressive 90% share. Upbit’s market dominance, which grew significantly between 2020 and 2021, remains strong today. Despite the impressive growth, South Korea’s crypto market continues to face challenges. The announcement of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol earlier this year, though later revoked, caused some disruption. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty and market volatility remain persistent issues. Policymakers are under increasing pressure to address these hurdles as the scale of cryptocurrency trading grows closer to that of traditional stock markets. The remarkable rise of digital assets in South Korea highlights their potential to transform the financial system, but it also underscores the urgent need for effective regulation and investor protection measures.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-25 12:09:51

This move comes as part of a broader strategy to balance energy consumption and ensure grid stability amid rising demand. Seasonal restrictions will also apply in other areas, highlighting the government's cautious approach to regulating the sector. The regions facing an outright ban include Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Meanwhile, in regions like Irkutsk, Buryatia, and the Trans-Baikal Territory, crypto mining will be paused during peak energy seasons: from January 1 to March 15, 2025, and annually from November 15 to March 15 thereafter. According to TASS, Russia’s state news agency, these restrictions are not set in stone and could change depending on the decisions made by the government’s legal committee overseeing energy policies. The aim is to balance electricity usage across regions, preventing energy shortages while maintaining economic stability. Sergei Kolobanov, Deputy Director of the Center for Economics of the Fuel and Energy Complex at CSR, explained that electricity subsidies play a significant role in this decision. In regions with low-cost energy, producers and consumers in other areas often shoulder the financial burden. Kolobanov suggests that if the energy market becomes more liberalized and capacity increases, some restrictions might eventually be lifted. Russia’s share in global Bitcoin mining hashrate has dropped significantly over the years. In 2021, Russia accounted for 11% of the global hashrate, but by 2024, this figure had fallen to 4.7% . Data from Cambridge University also reveals a decline in Russia’s average monthly hashrate, falling from 13.6 Eh/s to 8.7 Eh/s. In contrast, the United States dominates with a 37.8% share of the global Bitcoin mining hashrate. Despite legalizing cryptocurrency mining in August 2023, Russia has struggled to see meaningful growth in the sector. The government’s energy concerns and regional restrictions have acted as significant roadblocks. However, Russia has shown increasing openness to cryptocurrency usage in other areas. Cross-border crypto payments are now permitted, and plans are underway to launch state-backed cryptocurrency exchanges . Additionally, Russian lawmakers have floated the idea of holding Bitcoin reserves to strengthen financial stability amid international sanctions and economic challenges. While the regulatory environment remains complex, these developments indicate Russia’s evolving stance toward integrating cryptocurrencies into its financial system.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-25 12:18:15

This marks the largest single-day outflow since Bitcoin ETFs were launched. Analysts suggest profit-taking as the primary reason, although some question if this signals a deeper structural shift in investor sentiment. Before this downturn, Bitcoin ETFs enjoyed 15 consecutive days of positive net inflows, driving their total assets from $100 billion to $121 billion. However, recent outflows have pushed total net assets down to $105 billion. Data from SoSoValue indicates Grayscale’s GBTC fund was the main contributor, selling 1,870 BTC in just three days. In contrast, BlackRock’s IBIT fund continued buying, but its activity wasn't enough to offset the sell pressure. Despite this negative trend, confidence in Bitcoin remains strong. In December, Bitcoin ETFs surpassed gold ETFs in total assets under management (AUM), underlining growing trust in digital assets among institutional and retail investors. However, these recent outflows have temporarily stalled Bitcoin’s upward price trajectory. While Bitcoin struggled, Ethereum ETFs recorded inflows exceeding $130 million , with a notable surge during the December 23 trading session. On the same day, Bitcoin ETFs saw $226 million in outflows. BlackRock's Ethereum ETF has now accumulated over 1 million ETH, signaling increasing institutional interest in the asset. Investor Dan Gambardello remarked that Ethereum’s current accumulation phase, combined with BlackRock’s growing holdings, hints at a potential altcoin market revival . This comes as Ethereum’s price recently corrected from $4,100 to around $3,100. Many investors view this as a sign of a brewing altcoin season. Market experts suggest that while profit-taking explains much of the Bitcoin ETF outflows, the growing interest in Ethereum could indicate shifting investment preferences. BlackRock's substantial ETH holdings , coupled with Ethereum's price consolidation below its all-time high, may create momentum for further inflows into Ethereum ETFs. In summary, Bitcoin ETFs are facing heavy profit-taking pressure, while Ethereum ETFs are experiencing increased institutional attention. Investors are now closely watching whether this trend is temporary or marks the start of a larger shift in digital asset investment strategies. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate institutional portfolios, and their performance in the coming weeks will likely set the tone for the broader cryptocurrency market.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-25 12:22:00

This move circulated bullish waves across the markets as most of the altcoins surged back within a bullish pattern. The Solana price halted the bearish trend after reaching a pivotal support and after a brief consolidation, it initiated a strong rebound within the bullish zone. However, the price continues to face significant upward pressure, which raises concerns over the next price action. The SOL price faced a decent pullback that ousted the token from the top 5 cryptos as per the market capitalisation. However, the token is expected to revive a strong bullish action as it has entered the bullish range after triggering a rebound from the pivotal support. Therefore, this suggests the price is gearing up for another ascending price action towards new highs. The recent rebound from the crucial support at the 200-day EMA suggests the bulls have become active as they prevent the token from excess price drain. Meanwhile, the RSI has triggered a rebound after reaching the lower threshold, which may further keep up the momentum of the rally. However, the volume has dropped to a large extent which may raise some concerns over the next price action. After the rebound, the SOL price has entered within the bullish range, above the ascending trend line, which has been acting as strong support. Unless and until the price remains above the range, the probability of an extended ascending trend remains higher. In case of a bearish pullback, the 200-day EMA may offer a strong base and trigger a strong rebound. Now that the Solana (SOL) price has rebounded from a support confluence, the trend is expected to remain elevated and reclaim the levels at $300 in the first few days of 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 12:36:32

The answer to the question posed in the title is a clear and resounding “No.” Let’s explore why Bitcoin cannot rally 163% from $95K and hit $250,000 in the final days of 2024. Can Bitcoin Price Hit $250K in 2024? As mentioned above, BTC’s value cannot hit $250K in the final days of 2024. For Bitcoin price to achieve this target, it would need to gain 163% and that is highly unlikely. To provide context, Bitcoin’s year-to-date performance is 156%. Assuming that BTC would shoot up another 163% in just a week is highly unlikely. The demand for such a scenario does not exist in the crypto markets, or even if it did in the traditional markets, it would suddenly be redirected to BTC. Let’s explore a much more realistic outlook for Bitcoin. BTC Technical Analysis: How High Can Bitcoin Reach in 2024? As explained in a previous article Bitcoin is likely to rebound soon. On the four-hour chart, BTC created a local bottom on December 20 at $92,230, and since then it has set up a higher low of $92,465 and is currently showing strength. If the higher low is confirmed, it would suggest that the recovery rally has begun. In such a case, Bitcoin price prediction notes BTC’s next target would be the value area high (VAH) at $100K. However, if the momentum is strong during the festive season, BTC could flip the $100K hurdle into the support level and attempt to retest the 261,8% Fibonacci extension level at $115,881. This move would constitute a 20% rally, which is a considerable gain for BTC in the next week. In a highly bullish case, Bitcoin could hit $120K or $150K, which is the highest BTC could hit before 2024 ends, at least from a technical perspective. The second scenario includes Bitcoin sweeping the value area low (VAL) at $90.9K. Under these conditions as well, $116K to $120K is the highest BTC could reach before 2024 ends. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart On the other hand, a breakdown of $90.9K could trigger a steep 11% correction to the next support level at $81.1K. This move would increase the odds of a bear market for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 12:44:08

This has worked in Singapore’s favor, as the city has become a top destination for crypto companies. Unlike Hong Kong, which has slow approval processes and stricter rules, Singapore offers a more crypto-friendly environment for digital assets. Singapore Outpaces Hong Kong in Crypto Licenses In 2024, Singapore has taken the lead in the cryptocurrency sector, issuing 13 licenses to crypto companies this year, surpassing Hong Kong’s efforts. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is on track to issue these licenses by 2024, double the number granted last year and more than Hong Kong, which is also striving to become a crypto hub. As per the Bloomberg report , Singapore’s regulatory environment has attracted major players, including exchanges like OKX and Upbit. On the other hand, Hong Kong is lacking behind other countries, so far they have only approved 7 licenses and issued several temporary licenses. The strict regulations in Hong Kong can prove fatal as big institutions can easily turn their focus on other countries causing a financial disruption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Montenegro’s Top Court Rejects Do Kwon’s Appeal on Extradition, Likely To Go U.S. , Singapore vs Hong Kong Singapore’s regulatory system is seen as more supportive and stable, making it a safer place for crypto companies to grow. Firms like B2C2 have chosen to apply for licenses in Singapore to reduce risks. David Rogers, CEO of cryptocurrency market maker B2C2 Ltd has urged more crypto exchanges to apply for licenses in Singapore as a way to manage risks and expand their businesses. Interestingly, Singapore’s initiatives, like Project Guardian and Global Layer 1, led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, will increase asset tokenization and blockchain adoption in financial markets. These efforts make Singapore a stable and attractive hub for digital asset companies looking for a regional base. However talking about Hong Kong’s market, Angela Ang, senior policy adviser at consultancy TRM Labs, stated that Hong Kong’s tougher rules around asset custody and token listing have made it less appealing to new crypto firms. While Hong Kong has tried to attract crypto firms with initiatives like Bitcoin ETFs and a digital green bond, Singapore has done better in drawing companies. Conclusion Singapore is no doubt creating a secure place for crypto exchanges while other nations are still working on regulations and restricting cross-border transitions Singapore is paving the way for innovation in the country. Recently Ripple launched its stablecoin RLUSD in Singapore while it is still waiting for regulatory approval in the US. This is one of the best examples of cross-border payments. But looking at the global scale despite the ban, China showed its interest in Bitcoin to leverage this industry to support their economy and if they jump into the crypto game it will be a serious threat for many countries depending largely on Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38097284,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314079,1735130714,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev Predicts Stock Market Will Move On-Chain in Merging of Crypto and Equities,https://dailyhodl.com/2024/12/25/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-predicts-stock-market-will-move-on-chain-in-merging-of-crypto-and-equities/,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is predicting that stocks and other traditional finance (TradFi) assets will eventually move on-chain like cryptocurrencies. In a new interview with investor Anthony Pompliano, Tenev says that the efficiencies gained by using blockchain technology make its adoption by traditional finance inevitable. He also predicts that US President-elect Donald Trump and his administration will enact policies that will speed up the move to on-chain by stocks, private companies and real-world assets (RWAs) by tokenizing them. “What will happen is traditional equities – and I think all of this will be accelerated by the new [Trump] administration – will move onto blockchain rails, along with all sorts of other real-world assets. You’ll see private companies going on blockchain rails as well. Once you have public companies, then you’ll have to think through what does it mean to actually go public and list on a blockchain as opposed to on a traditional stock exchange? I think we’ll have to figure that out, and then that opens up private markets as well. And what you gain is interoperability. I don’t know if you’ve tried to move stocks from a legacy discount broker to Robinhood. A lot of people do it, and it’s very, very painful. And by the way, the big brokerage houses don’t want to make it easy. They want to keep those assets there, so they’ll put all sorts of non-technical barriers in the way too. But contrast that with how easy it is to move dollar stablecoins or Bitcoin from your MetaMask wallet to your Phantom or your Robinhood wallet, everything just kind of works, because the infrastructure underlying the assets and the transactions is all public.” Tenev believes on-chain transactions are the logical next step in the evolution of TradFi processes since it would simplify them. “You have no need for transfer agents, for central clearing houses or payment processors. All of that’s replaced by software. My view of crypto is it’s sort of the next step in how financial infrastructure evolves. It started with pen and paper and filing cabinet. It went to mainframe. It went to on-premise and cloud. And then crypto is just the next layer there where you’ll see traditional financial services on crypto rails. They’ll be easier to use, better, more interoperable, and I think the US will have to adopt it. The efficiency gains are just going to be too high to ignore.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This renewed momentum has reignited investor optimism, positioning Solana as a standout in the crypto market. Key metrics from Glassnode further bolster this sentiment, revealing that Solana has consistently maintained a positive net capital inflow since early September 2023. While minor outflows were observed, the overall trend underscores sustained interest and confidence in the project. Related Reading: XRP Whales Keep Buying – Data Reveals Smart Money Prepares For A Rally These capital inflows highlight Solana’s growing adoption and utility, indicating that the blockchain ecosystem continues to attract new participants and capital. As the market evolves, such metrics suggest that Solana is poised for continued growth, supported by strong fundamentals and a thriving developer community. With its recovery gaining traction, Solana remains a top contender for investors eyeing projects with robust long-term potential. The consistent inflow of capital not only reflects market confidence but also sets the stage for further expansion in the coming months. Whether through innovative dApps, enhanced scalability, or increasing network activity, Solana’s upward trajectory seems far from over, making it a focal point in the broader crypto landscape. Solana Metrics Reveal A Growing Network Solana appears to be on the brink of a massive rally next year as its network continues to demonstrate sustained growth and resilience. According to an insightful report by Glassnode, Solana has consistently recorded positive net capital inflows since early September 2023. Despite minor outflows during this period, the overall trend highlights the network’s ability to attract liquidity and maintain investor confidence. One of the report’s most striking revelations is the peak daily inflow of $776 million in new capital, underscoring significant interest and participation within the ecosystem. This sustained influx of liquidity has not only bolstered Solana’s growth but has also played a pivotal role in supporting its price stability and appreciation. Such a consistent capital inflow suggests that investors view Solana as a high-potential project capable of outperforming in the coming months.

If the current trend of capital inflows persists, it could serve as a catalyst for a massive rally, potentially surpassing previous highs. As we look ahead to 2025, Solana remains a project to watch, offering investors an opportunity to participate in a blockchain ecosystem that is rapidly gaining prominence in the crypto space. Strong Bounce From Key Demand Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $199 after successfully bouncing from the $175 level, a critical demand zone that has proven to be a robust support area. This rebound showcases Solana’s underlying strength and its ability to attract buyers at key levels, setting the stage for further upward momentum. The $175 mark has historically acted as a launchpad for SOL, and this time is no different, as the price now targets higher levels. If Solana manages to push above the $210 resistance level in the coming days, a rapid surge is likely to follow. Breaking this barrier would signal strong bullish momentum, potentially propelling SOL into new highs and reigniting investor enthusiasm. However, the market could also experience a period of sideways consolidation as traders assess the current conditions and prepare for the next significant move. Related Reading: If History Repeats Dogecoin Has Potential For A Parabolic Rally – Details Consolidation above the $190 level would still be a positive sign, indicating that SOL is building a solid foundation for its next rally. Maintaining strength around these levels is critical to sustaining the bullish outlook, as any failure to hold could lead to a retest of lower demand zones. For now, all eyes are on Solana as it navigates key price levels and prepares for its next move.

XRP has captured headlines as its trading volume surged past $10 billion at the peak of the holiday season, reaffirming its dominance amid ongoing market corrections. At the same time, DTX Exchange is making waves with its Stage 6 presale nearing a sellout and strong investor momentum fueling excitement for what’s next. As XRP eyes a potential breakout and DTX builds anticipation for a rally, the stage is set for these two assets to drive the next chapter of the bull cycle. XRP Trading Volume Crosses $10 Billion Despite broader market pullbacks, XRP’s trading volume soared to over $10.12 billion, positioning it as one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies in December. Currently trading at $2.31, XRP has maintained its place as the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $125.29 billion. Source: Tradingview While XRP is down 11.08% over the past week, analysts remain optimistic about its next move. Key support at $1.92 has been identified as a crucial rebuy zone for bullish traders, with resistance levels at $2.28 serving as the next hurdle. Once broken, XRP could rally to the much-anticipated $4 mark, with projections pointing to a potential breakout in early 2025. XRP has also dominated Binance Futures, accounting for $116.6 million in December trading volume and emerging as the platform’s most traded altcoin. Additionally, wallet growth has surged by 28% over the past two years, reflecting a growing adoption rate and sustained investor confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem. With the RLUSD stablecoin launch bolstering Ripple’s utility and regulatory clarity on the horizon in 2025, XRP’s strong volume and price action suggest the token is poised for further gains in the new year. DTX Exchange: Stage 6 Presale on the Verge of Sellout While XRP commands attention in the broader market, DTX Exchange is creating its own buzz in the DeFi space. The platform’s Stage 6 presale is close to selling out, following its $10.24 million presale raise, which has cemented DTX as one of the most promising projects of this cycle. DTX’s appeal lies in its distributed liquidity pools, which aggregate liquidity from multiple sources to reduce slippage and enhance trading execution. This innovative approach has positioned DTX Exchange as a leader in decentralized trading, catering to both retail and institutional investors. With growing community support and analysts predicting a 33x rally in the near term, DTX is being closely compared to the early success stories of Solana and Cardano. Investors are racing to secure positions before the presale ends, as DTX gears up for what could be a transformative breakout in 2025. What Lies Ahead for XRP and DTX As the year comes to a close, XRP and DTX Exchange are shaping up to be key players in the crypto market. XRP’s surge in trading volume and anticipation of a breakout to $4 underscore its resilience as a market leader, while DTX’s presale momentum and unique features position it as a rising star in the DeFi sector. The interplay between XRP’s established dominance and DTX’s rapid growth could define early trends in 2025, as both projects attract attention from retail and institutional investors alike. With strong fundamentals and bullish sentiment surrounding these assets, their next moves will be critical in shaping the broader market narrative heading into the new year.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Rise of a Fun and Plentiful Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. It features a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially considered a “memecoin,” it gained significant value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This growth was influenced by social media attention and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s community-driven nature and widespread popularity demonstrate the impact of social media on financial markets. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin’s accessibility and strong community support may make it an attractive option for some investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by Ryoshi, it started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s prominence. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can interact with Ethereum applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a community governance system, giving SHIB potential for broader use. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s developments and Ethereum compatibility may make it an attractive option. Conclusion With DOGEN’s astounding rally, meme coins like DOGE and SHIB have less short-term potential. DOGEN caters to those seeking the finest, embodying luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale’s end with potential for thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Recent market analyses suggest that these two giants may not yet hit their new all-time highs in this ongoing cycle. Such unexpected changes will likely make a difference in investors’ business conduct. Suddenly, new tokens emerged that brought in more promise for upward movement. One such bright star is DTX Exchange (DTX), which is currently stirring up hype and positioning itself to be recognized as one of the most serious contenders on the grounds of this much-waited top 100 listing. Most importantly, DTX Exchange is becoming popular fast with its innovative managed platform for crypto trading. The individual characterizes a solid intersection of traditional finance and digital assets inside one seamless and comprehensive platform. Investors are restructuring their portfolios and re-strategizing for high-gaining new opportunities with prospective developing ecosystems and the dynamic market shift. Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) Struggle to Realize Their Full Potential Cardano and Ripple compete to break records from all-time highs, which are highly popular for their strong community bases around these two currencies. Presently trading above $0.9, Cardano remains on the move and is grasping again. While this great praise is directed towards its steady approach to development, it has left the project slow in adopting new advantages compared to more agile competitors. More or less similar goes with Ripple (XRP), the last two litigation controversies have taken the edge off XRP, which has caused RLUSD to launch into the world. Though XRP is presently trading between $2.20 and $2.30, price action has not been as high as anticipated just a few days back. Current developments of the XRP are still tied under regulatory clouds hovering over it, so its market performance continues to be affected. Despite their good showings in the angularity networks, Cardano and Ripple continue falling behind as good prospects for increased growth. DTX Is Revolutionizing Crypto Trading with 1000x Leverage, High-Performance Technology, and Comprehensive Market Integration With Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) struggling against the market’s tide, a glimmer of hope shines in DTX Exchange (DTX), heralding another innovative entry into the crypto space. The ongoing presale, now at the sixth stage, has so far netted DTX an impressive $10.5 million from tokens selling at $0.12. The next stage will record a hike to $0.14, which denotes rising confidence and investor inflow. The thing that DTX Exchange adds to trade is the comprehensive outlook, being the first crypto-native proposition on stocks, forex, ETF trading, and more than 100,000 currency pairs bridges the new with the old in finance. This unique stance is being endorsed by over 300,000 wallets due to the high level of usage registered by its traders and investors. A mouthful of online currencies promising an exchange trading platform is much more than just a revolution. It boasts up to 1000x leverage, and thus, users considerably amplify trade possibilities. The VulcanX testnet attests to the phenomenal ability to carry out upwards of 100,000 transactions per second, thus positioning DTX Exchange powerfully as a high-performance trading ecosystem. The Phoenix Wallet, on the other side, pledges a very secure custody solution for crypto, stocks, and forex in an attempt to address the very vital clouds hanging over the evolving digital asset space. Conclusion The crypto community is all set to go through all expected anticipation just before the DTX Exchange live launch in Q1 of 2025. Tokenized ETF trading adds a different dimension to the DTX canvas, especially among users in jurisdictions with limited access to traditional ETFs. This innovative approach is bound to see DTX become a significant disruptor in the crypto trading landscape. While still huge players in the crypto realm, Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) leave way for other market frontiers occupied by platforms such as DTX Exchange . All of such aspirations, coupled with a full range of trading options, pushing-edge technology, and a growing community backing, hold DTX in a firm position to rock the world with possible high tides in crypto. As the platform aspires to enter the top 100, its early investors stand a rare chance of being part of what could become the single most lucrative tale of success in digital assets. The crypto space is ever-changing, and DTX Exchange only appears to be one of the few that lead through this change, showing a glimpse of future integrated digital finance.

Speaking to CNBC, Tom Lee shared his expectations for the markets in 2025 and made another bold prediction for Bitcoin. The famous CEO said he was optimistic for BTC and altcoins, stating that there would be a more favorable regulatory environment under the Donald Trump administration. Stating that the demand for Bitcoin will increase further in 2025, Lee advised investors to keep Bitcoin at the center of their crypto investments and allocate more space to it in their portfolios. Lee, who also announced his BTC price prediction, stated that he expects the price to reach around $250,000 next year. Stating that he expects an increase in altcoins other than Bitcoin, Lee said that he expects Ethereum (ETH) to show a strong performance and reach $5,000 to $6,000. Stating that there will be a major altcoin rally in 2025, Lee also predicted that altcoins such as Solana (SOL) will experience significant increases. *This is not investment advice.

Bogus Copyright Notices Leveraged to Dupe Victims The attacker impersonated the X platform team and sent fake copyright infringement notices to targeted users. These messages were urgent, meaning the victims clicked on phishing links. On these phishing websites, the users unknowingly reset their account passwords and 2FA credentials, thus giving the hacker complete access. Crypto Accounts with Large Followings Targeted Among the compromised accounts were Kick, Cursor, The Arena, Brett, and Alex Blania, all very popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Combined, these accounts have in excess of 200,000 followers, most of whom are memecoin investors looking for the next big thing. The hacker posted scams in each of these accounts, captioned “Incoming Transmission”, followed by a fake token announcement and contract address. The posts deceived users into interacting with the scam projects to siphon funds. Obfuscation of Stolen Funds ZachXBT followed the operation to six deployer addresses used in the scams. The attacker bridged assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks , a modus operandi of cyber attackers as they mask the origin of stolen funds and confuse their movements in order not to be traced. Security Tips for X Users ZachXBT encouraged the users to take extra care to secure their accounts. Suggestions include not using the same email address on different platforms and providing 2FA for critical accounts. Making these options stronger will reduce the chance of such attacks. Wider Context of Crypto Scams This incident joins a spate of crimes related to crypto that seem to be on the increase. Although phishing losses decreased 53% month-over-month in November to $9.3 million, it appears scammers are trying harder during the holiday season. As it were, Chainalysis estimates that already in 2024, $2.2 billion has been stolen across 303 major incidents-a 21% increase from the previous year. Centralized services remain the hardest hit, making cybersecurity a critical concern for the crypto community . By exposing these scams, investigators like ZachXBT highlight the growing need for vigilance among cryptocurrency users. Protecting personal information and account access remains paramount in combating these sophisticated cybercrimes.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-25 13:06:18

Under such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that many U.S. politicians – generally known as savvy and prolific traders – have started engaging with the sector. Receive Signals on SEC-verified Insider Stock Trades Stocks This signal is triggered upon the reporting of the trade to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Enable signal Since the start of 2024, there has been no shortage of filings showing Congresspeople buying meme coins , as well as more established coins and tokens such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). Politicians aggressively trading meme coins in 2024 Despite this activity, the cryptocurrency market’s volatility, paired with the more common roadblocks to accurately measuring politicians’ returns, makes it somewhat difficult to determine which elected officials made the most in the cryptocurrency market this year. Representative Mike Collins, for example, is a prime candidate for Congress’ big cryptocurrency winner. In 2024, the politician has been actively trading both established digital assets such as Ethereum and meme coins such as Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ) and Ski Mask Dog ( SKI ). The Congressman’s current meme coin holdings – most notably AERO purchased in early November and SKI bought in early December – are solidly in the green, and his earlier cryptocurrency investments have potentially provided triple-digit returns. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal On the other hand, though it is dubious if he is in the green on his digital assets at press time, Barry Moore has a significant potential to make stellar returns on his digital assets. Representative Morre is a long-term holder of multiple coins and tokens, including Cardano ( ADA ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Moore, however, also has the misfortune that the bulk of his cryptocurrency was purchased near the 2021 highs. Are these early adopters the most successful crypto traders in Congress? The story is much the same for the prominent blockchain advocate in the Senate, Cynthia Lummis . Still, unlike Representative Moore, Senator Lummis is likely in the green on her 2021 BTC investment due to the coin’s rise to new and exceptionally high all-time highs (ATH) in 2024. Ultimately, the case may be that a somewhat uninteresting answer to which U.S. politicians made the most from digital assets in 2024 is correct. Receive Signals on US Senators' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Senators.

Among the underpriced treasures ready for a revolution, Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and TRON (TRX) mainly show promise for expansion. Rexas Finance (RXS) is leading the way, as its innovative approach to asset management and significant presale momentum help these three cryptocurrencies reach the sought-after $1 mark. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Top Contender to Reach $1 Thanks to its creative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance (RXS) has rapidly become one of the most promising cryptocurrencies of this bull cycle. By letting people tokenize and invest in real estate, art, and commodities, Rexas Finance is building a future with unlimited asset ownership and liquidity. This utility-driven approach makes it the most underpriced cryptocurrency worth observing. Priced at $0.15 in its 10th presale round as of writing, RXS has so far raised an impressive $30.70 million, which reflects great investor confidence. The earlier presale stages of the token sold out ahead of time, which is evidence of its increasing appeal. According to market analysts, Rexas Finance (RXS) will see a 567% price increase during this bull cycle, forcing its price to $1. The token’s notable 400% increase from the commencement of its presale—where it was first valued at just $0.03—helps to corroborate this estimate. Approaching its expected listing price of $0.20, Rexas Finance (RXS) promises assured returns. Furthermore, the coin, which intends to be listed on three tier-1 platforms, can draw even more liquidity and interest. These elements make Rexas Finance a revolution in asset management and a great cryptocurrency. Its creative use case and great presale momentum help distinguish it as the most significant underpriced cryptocurrency to hit $1 in this bull cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Memecoin with Serious Momentum With growing acceptance and community support, Dogecoin (DOGE) has become a powerhouse cryptocurrency. At $0.3845 as of writing, DOGE has shown amazing performance: over 300% year-to-date growth and a 250% increase in the last three months. Its comeback underscores the growing curiosity of institutional and individual investors. Over the medium to long term, DOGE’s price movement has been within a horizontal trend channel, indicating the possibility of an ongoing increase. Supported at $0.17 and opposed at $0.47, the token is about to exceed its resistance level. Analysts estimate that Dogecoin will hit $1 in this bull cycle driven by increasing payment acceptance and the support of well-known activists. Dogecoin appeals mostly for its simplicity and general availability. Initially driven by excitement, the coin has recently become a respectable investment thanks to growing use cases on e-commerce and tipping systems. DOGE is still a strong competitor to reach $1 even if its path depends mostly on market mood and community-driven initiatives as the market turns positive.

According to his recent statement, the Russian firms are already using BTC and other digital currencies for foreign trade after recent legislative changes. Notably, this comes after the country has recently banned BTC mining in six regions till 2031, which has fueled market speculations. Russia Embraces Bitcoin & Other Digital Assets Russia has embraced Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to navigate economic challenges posed by Western sanctions. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently confirmed that Russian companies are leveraging digital currencies for international trade. This strategic shift comes after regulatory changes permitted cryptocurrency use in foreign trade. According to a recent Reuters report , which cited a Russia 24 interview, Siluanov emphasized the importance of Bitcoin in Russia’s evolving trade strategy. He noted that cryptocurrency transactions are already underway and expressed optimism about their expansion in 2024. These steps align with the government’s experimental approach to integrating cryptocurrencies into the nation’s financial system. Meanwhile, the shift also reflects a broader push to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar. President Vladimir Putin recently criticized the U.S. administration’s politicization of the dollar, asserting that this has forced countries to explore alternative assets like Bitcoin. Putin also highlighted Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, which he sees as a safeguard against external regulatory interference. These recent developments have fueled market optimism amid growing market interest in the digital assets space. In addition, it has also fueled speculations over a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve by the country, especially after lawmakers proposed a similar move recently. Besides, global leaders are also shifting focus towards the flagship crypto recently. Optimism Soars Despite Recent Crypto Ban Russia’s pro-crypto trade stance contrasts sharply with its recent ban on Bitcoin mining in six regions until 2031. This regulatory move has stirred mixed reactions within the market, raising questions about the country’s long-term crypto policy. However, despite the ban, Russia remains a significant player in the global cryptocurrency mining industry. This duality indicates that the government is carefully balancing its domestic and international crypto strategies. By legalizing crypto mining and its usage in trade, Russia aims to offset the financial hurdles created by sanctions while managing the local impact of mining activities. Meanwhile, as the nation experiments with cryptocurrencies in trade, the global community is closely watching its progress. With Finance Minister Siluanov predicting greater adoption of digital currencies in the near future, Russia’s crypto journey could set a precedent for other sanction-hit economies. Notably, he stated: “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” The post Russia Taps Bitcoin & Crypto For Foreign Trade, Here’s Why appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Russia|Russia Crypto Mining|Russia crypto regulation|Russian Sanctions,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-25 13:28:52

XRP rebounded to $2.27 after a correction, with analysts predicting a substantial rally in the short term. The Next Exchange to Jump on the Bandwagon After months of testing and preparation, Ripple’s stablecoin officially went live mid-December. This became possible after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approved it. The product, called RLUSD, is pegged 1:1 to the American dollar and designed to play a crucial role in Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions. Upon launch, the stablecoin was embraced by multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, Moonpay, CoinMENA, and others. Most recently, the Peter Thiel-backed Bullish also joined the list. The company announced that users can deal with the following trading pairs: RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, XRP/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD, and SOL/RLUSD. Earlier this month, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz warned the community about a potential volatility surrounding the product. He said there might be initial fluctuations but eventually the price should settle around $1. The exec also alerted people not to FOMO into a stablecoin since it is “not an opportunity to get rich.” According to CoinGecko’s data, RLUSD started trading at approximately $1 upon launch, but in the following days, it hovered between $0.96 and $1.06. The valuation has stabilized since the beginning of the week, currently set at around $0.99. RLUSD Price, Source: CoinGecko XRP Price Outlook Numerous industry participants have maintained that RLUSD’s introduction could be among the factors fueling a price rally for Ripple’s native token. In fact, XRP saw a substantial pump in mid-December (when the product saw the light of day), with its price tapping $2.70. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko However, the crypto market correction witnessed at the end of last week suppressed the asset to under $2. In the last few days, the bulls managed to recover some of the lost ground, and XRP is currently worth around $2.27. Crypto X is full of analysts who believe it is time for a new rally. Crypto Bitlord, an X user with almost 400,000 followers, recently suggested that “the final pump for 2024 is loading.” For their part, CrediBULL Crypto claimed that “the XRP/BTC chart below looks absolutely fantastic” and “the most bullish-looking chart in the entire space.” One element indicating that Ripple’s native token could indeed experience a price jump in the near future is the whales’ activity. Ali Martinez claimed that such large investors have purchased millions of tokens in the past week. These actions decrease the available supply of XRP on the open market, potentially leading to a price increase if demand remains steady or grows. Significant whale purchases might also generate enthusiasm among smaller investors, encouraging them to buy in as well , which could amplify the upward momentum.

This software company turned Bitcoin whale looks posied to be a problem for the bears betting against it. With over 444,000 bitcoins in its arsenal right now, MicroStrategy owns more Bitcoin than any other corporation in the world. President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies are fueling a meteoric rise for the industry. He is expected to flip the script on regulation and set up a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. But what’s really about to light up is MicroStrategy, just as it joins the Nasdaq-100. This will force institutional investors to buy MSTR, adding nearly $11 million in retail capital to the pot. The result? A potential short squeeze that could send the stock price into orbit. MicroStrategy’s numbers: A high-stakes gamble with Bitcoin MicroStrategy has gone all in, staking its future on Bitcoin’s success. The company’s 2024 has been insane—its stock is up 440% over the past year and 123% in just three months. For context, that’s more than triple the performance of Bitcoin itself. In Q3, MicroStrategy reported $116.1 million in revenue, a 10.3% drop from the previous year. That’s not great, but let’s be real—nobody cares about the software business anymore. What matters is Bitcoin. By the end of October, the company’s stash had grown to 252,220 bitcoins, valued at $9.9 billion. This is the core of its strategy: buy Bitcoin, hold it, and wait for the price to explode. To fund this, MicroStrategy sold 8 million Class A shares for $1.1 billion and doubled its long-term debt to $4.3 billion. The company’s “21/21 Plan” is as ambitious as it sounds. MicroStrategy wants to raise $42 billion, split between equity and debt, to buy even more Bitcoin. If you think that’s excessive, you’re not wrong. But the market seems to love it. Gautam Chhugani from Bernstein raised his price target for MSTR to $600, calling the company’s Bitcoin strategy “unprecedented.” TD Cowen followed with a target of $525. Benchmark has the most bullish target at $650, nearly double the current price. Risks and rewards: The Bitcoin rollercoaster MicroStrategy’s bet on Bitcoin has paid off so far, but it’s not without risks. The company’s operating expenses soared by 300% in Q3 to $514.3 million, thanks to impairment losses on its digital assets. Its cash balance is just $46.3 million—a tiny cushion for a company this leveraged. And while the $3 billion convertible bond issuance at a 0% coupon provided interest-free capital, it’s a double-edged sword. If the stock price falls, MicroStrategy could be forced to raise more money to repay debt, creating a potential liquidity crisis. Yet, this hasn’t stopped CEO Michael Saylor from doubling down. MicroStrategy is banking on Bitcoin hitting $1 million by 2033. Analysts seem to think this is more than a pipe dream. Chhugani predicts MicroStrategy could own 4% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2033. TD Cowen estimates the company’s holdings will reach $108 billion by 2027. As of press time though, short interest in MicroStrategy is climbing. Bears are betting the company’s focus on Bitcoin will backfire, but they’re playing with fire. When institutional money starts pouring in after Christmas, those shorts will be forced to cover, driving the stock price even higher. Analysts are calling this a perfect setup for a short squeeze, and they’re probably right. MicroStrategy’s current valuation is steep—157.65 times forward sales, to be exact. That’s higher than Coinbase and Block, two giants in the crypto industry. But investors don’t seem to care.

Kwon’s appeal, which challenged his extradition ruling, was unanimously rejected by the court. Dwindling Legal Options for Kwon According to the report by local media outlet ‘Korea JoongAng Daily,’ the court’s decision upheld the earlier ruling favoring Kwon’s extradition, with the Justice Minister, Bojan Božović, set to make the final call on whether he will face trial in his home country of South Korea or be sent to the United States. Kwon’s appeal was rejected on grounds of legal inconsistencies. The court also dismissed his arguments of procedural unfairness and violations of his rights. Kwon has been under intense scrutiny since the May 2022 collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and its sister token, Luna, which caused a devastating $40 billion market loss. Both the US and South Korea have requested his extradition, accusing him of financial crimes, including fraud and market manipulation. After fleeing South Korea, Kwon traveled through several countries, including Singapore, the UAE, and Serbia, before being arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for attempting to travel with a forged passport. As such, the latest ruling by the court significantly narrows Kwon’s legal options for delaying extradition, and analysts predict that Montenegro may ultimately send him to the US, where he faces charges related to the Terra-Luna collapse. Kwon’s legal situation is further complicated by a massive civil penalty imposed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June 2024, Terraform Labs and Kwon agreed to a $4.5 billion settlement with the securities agency, including hefty fines for Kwon personally, as well as a ban on engaging in crypto transactions. Kwon’s Fate Hangs in Limbo Despite the ruling, Kwon’s legal team is expected to continue fighting against his extradition, particularly to the US, where the charges are more extensive. Meanwhile, South Korea has urged for a quicker resolution while expressing concerns over potential human rights violations due to delays in the extradition process. With the ruling, Kwon’s fate now lies in the hands of Montenegro’s Justice Minister, who will determine his next legal steps.

According to Reuters, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Russia has started using Bitcoin in foreign trade. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that Russian companies started using Bitcoin and other digital currencies in international payments after the introduction of legal regulations against Western sanctions. Siluanov told Russia 24 television: “As part of the experimental phase, it is possible to use Bitcoins mined in Russia in foreign trade transactions. “Such transactions are already taking place. We believe they need to be expanded and developed further. I am confident that this expansion will happen next year.” Siluanov said the move was aimed at circumventing Western sanctions and increasing financial independence, adding that Russia would be trading more in digital currencies. Western sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have made it difficult for Russia to trade with major partners such as China or Turkey, as local banks are extremely cautious in dealing with Russia to avoid scrutiny from Western regulators. *This is not investment advice.

Faced with mounting sanctions and struggling trade routes, the country is turning to Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This move isn’t just about innovation—it’s survival. With sanctions squeezing traditional payment systems, Russia wants to keep trade alive, no matter what. What’s the Bitcoin Plan? In July, Russia passed a major law legalizing cryptocurrency for international payments . It’s a big deal. The goal? To sidestep sanctions and keep goods moving with countries like China and Turkey. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov says this isn’t just a plan on paper—companies are already using Bitcoin to settle deals. And it’s not just Russia doing this. Iran has been using mined Bitcoin to dodge sanctions for years. Russia seems to be borrowing a page from their playbook, hoping digital currencies can provide some much-needed breathing room. Officials even predict crypto demand will skyrocket next year as more businesses get on board. But this isn’t just about Bitcoin. President Vladimir Putin has also backed the digital ruble, a blockchain-based version of the national currency. He called it “experimental” but said it’s a necessary step forward. At the same time, Putin stressed the need to regulate mining farms , which are booming but causing power shortages in some regions. Not Everything’s Fair Game Here’s the catch: while Russia is all-in on crypto for international trade, domestic use is still off-limits . You can’t buy a coffee with Bitcoin in Moscow, and the Central Bank wants to keep it that way. They’re worried about fraud and energy consumption spiraling out of control. Even so, the government’s creating a framework to regulate the industry. They’re considering a Bitcoin reserve to support foreign trade exclusively. It’s a careful balancing act—embracing crypto without letting it disrupt things at home. What to Expect This is just the beginning. By betting on cryptocurrencies, Russia’s trying to break free from a system it feels has been weaponized against it. Will it work? That’s the big question. For now, one thing’s clear: digital currencies are playing a bigger role in global trade. And for countries like Russia, they’re not just an experiment—they’re a lifeline.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 13:53:31

On Wednesday, the token’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, spotlighted ‘SHIB: The Metaverse’ launch while also saying ‘more TREATS soon,’ sparking optimism across the SHIB community. Notably, this comes amid soaring speculations of a looming TREAT token launch for the meme coin’s ecosystem that is expected to enhance governance and act as the network’s stablecoin. Amid this, Kusama’s recent statements have gained considerable traction while also igniting hope for the token’s price despite the market’s recent volatility. Shiba Inu Price Aims For Rally Amid Recent Ecosystem Developments SHIB lead developer Shytoshi Kusama took to X on December 25, spotlighting the recent launch of “SHIB: The Metaverse.” This recent endeavor has marked a monumental stride for one of the top dog-themed meme crypto community, offering it enhanced market visibility. Besides, it has also fueled speculations over a potential rally in the Shiba Inu price ahead. Notably, in light of this development, Kusama stated, “Merry Christmas to you all. More TREATS on the way SOON.” This statement has gained significant traction, primarily as the broader industry keenly awaits the TREAT launching shortly . Notably, the arrival of the new token is expected to boost crypto’s ecosystem governance and DeFi capabilities. Altogether, the enhanced offerings pave the way for further market interaction with the asset, projecting optimism over its future endeavors. Shytoshi Kusama X post Meanwhile, CoinGape revealed that the ecosystem’s layer-2 network, Shibarium, also saw a significant surge in activity. Shibarium addresses reportedly jumped and crossed the 2.02 million milestone, marking another monumental stride for the dog-themed meme coin’s community. Overall, the recent ecosystem advancements have ignited soaring waves of optimism for Shiba Inu price as the token’s ecosystem continues to bring about revolutionary market changes. SHIB To Breakout Ahead? At the time of reporting, SHIB price noted gains worth 3% intraday and is currently trading at $0.00002307. However, the weekly chart indicated a 10% drop in light of the recent market volatility. Nevertheless, a recent CoinGape report revealed that the latest on-chain data flagged an ongoing bullish trend for SHIB . According to the report, the meme coin’s exchange supply witnessed a substantial drop in recent days, indicating that investors are withdrawing and expecting future gains in the asset. SHIB whale activity also saw a remarkable surge recently, adding to market bullishness surrounding the asset. Further, leading crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently took to X, revealing that Shiba Inu price also has an eye for a rebound to $0.000026 or even $0.000029. This bullish projection aligns with the TD Sequential indicator that presented a buy signal on the daily chart as of December 24. Market watchers continue to gauge the coin’s price movements for further shifts in light of the abovementioned developments.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

We believe they should be expanded and developed further,” he told Russia 24 TV . He also made it clear that this is just the beginning, calling crypto payments “the future of international trade.” From Bitcoin bans to full-blown adoption Russia’s crypto history has been wild. In 2017, the government looked at blockchain tech like a curious kid with a new toy, but it quickly slammed the brakes, banning cryptos for payments. The official excuse? Concerns about financial stability and preventing shady activities. Fast forward to 2020, and the rules softened, but not by much. Crypto was legalized, but their use for transactions remained off the table. Now, 2024 has flipped the script. Russia’s lawmakers gave mining the green light, effective November 1, and legalized the use of crypto for cross-border payments. The timing isn’t random. With sanctions making traditional trade channels nearly impossible, crypto has become the lifeline. Russia isn’t playing small ball here. In 2023 alone, the country mined 54,000 Bitcoins, pulling in 50 billion rubles (around $550 million) in tax revenue. With new laws in place, the potential for growth is massive. President Vladimir Putin threw his weight behind them, criticizing the U.S. for using the dollar as a political weapon. “The U.S. undermines the dollar’s role as a global reserve currency,” he said earlier this month, calling Bitcoin a viable alternative. And for good measure, he added, “No one in the world can regulate Bitcoin.” The country is now the second-largest Bitcoin mining hub in the world, right behind the United States. Why? Cheap electricity and freezing weather. Perfect conditions for running mining rigs 24/7. But here’s the catch: all that mining comes with a huge electricity bill. To keep things under control, the government has slapped mining bans on ten regions, including Dagestan and Chechnya. Starting January 1, these bans will last six years. And it doesn’t stop there. Seasonal restrictions are set for energy-heavy areas like Irkutsk during winter. Eastern Europe is already a hotbed for crypto activity, and Russia is leading the charge. Between July 2023 and June 2024, the region handled $499 billion in on-chain crypto value, and Russia ranked seventh globally for crypto adoption. These platforms allow users to sidestep traditional banks, which have become increasingly isolated due to sanctions.

The exchange highlighted current analyst predictions ranging from $3 to $7 and called on the community members to share their predictions for the digital asset. Some investors view these estimates as conservative, citing the XRP’s increasing adoption and potential regulatory clarity as drivers for a much higher valuation. Others, however, argue that price forecasts in the volatile cryptocurrency market are inherently unpredictable and should be approached with caution. $3–$7 for $XRP in 2025?

Institutions, CBDCs, and massive… — ꪑỉᨶꫝꪖꫀꪶ ꪖꪹꪶỉ᭢ (@mrcauliman) December 23, 2024 XRP Army Predictions One user commented that a target of “$3–$7 for XRP in 2025” is laughable, asserting that “$100+ isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable.” He attributed this confidence to the digital asset’s regulatory clarity and broader adoption of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Ripple’s payment solution powered by XRP. The user further emphasized that institutional use cases, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and increased transaction volumes could create a feedback loop of demand for XRP, pushing its price up. Increased demand is one of many reasons why the community is also excited about RLUSD’s launch and its benefits for XRP. In contrast, other responses reflected a more cautious stance. One user expressed skepticism, stating, “These things are super unpredictable,” adding that we can only hope the asset surpasses its all-time high. More Bullish Expectations for XRP Among the optimistic projections, some users provided detailed reasoning behind their price targets. For instance, one participant highlighted Bitstamp’s plans to build a derivatives exchange as a bullish development. Bitstamp recently partnered with Robinhood to achieve this goal, and the commenter set an initial price target of $10. He also emphasized a long-term outlook, citing expectations for blockchain growth and potential staking opportunities for XRP holders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the institutional front, several developments could influence XRP’s trajectory. Regulatory clarity is widely regarded as a critical factor, particularly in the U.S., where Ripple has been engaged in a legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, many experts believe the incoming administration led by Donald Trump will end this lawsuit , improving XRP’s legal clarity and opening more doors for innovation in the crypto space. Additionally, the growing adoption of ODL could bolster XRP’s utility and value proposition. ODL facilitates cross-border payments by leveraging XRP as a bridge currency, reducing transaction costs and settlement times. The integration of XRP into CBDC initiatives and increased use of the XRPL for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications could also further strengthen demand and fuel a price increase.

Source: Ali Martinez, X Besides, Ripple’s recent launch of RLUSD stablecoin has also fueled market optimism. It marks a crucial milestone for the blockchain firm, with a flurry of exchanges like Bullish Exchange adding it to their platforms. In addition, it also debuted in the Singapore market with the Independent Reserve (IR) exchange listing recently. On the other hand, the anticipation over XRP ETF also soared recently, especially with Donald Trump’s election win. A flurry of key players have already filed to launch the investment instrument in the US. Now, with US SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation in January 2025, whom many deem as an anti-crypto regulator, optimism peaked toward a potential launch ahead. In addition, Donald Trump’s focus on the crypto issued by US-based firms has also fueled speculations. Meanwhile, many in the crypto community also anticipate the ongoing Ripple Vs SEC case to conclude with pro-crypto Paul Atkin’s nomination as the US SEC Chairman by Donald Trump. Ripple’s Native Crypto Eyes Breakout XRP price today was down about 0.7% and exchanged hands at $0.29, after touching a 24-hour high of $2.35. Notably, this decline comes as Whale Alert showed that an XRP whale, identified by the wallet address “rBgEs..SLEcj”, has recently dumped 30.17 million coins. According to the report, the whale has dumped XRP worth $69.24 million to the leading crypto exchange Coinbase. On the other hand, the Futures Open Interest for Ripple’s native crypto stayed near the flatline, indicating that investors are taking a pause amid the holiday season. However, top experts have shared bullish forecasts for the crypto, indicating a new XRP ATH soon. In a recent X post, popular market analyst EGRAG Crypto said that XRP is poised to $3.775 in the near term. However, he also warned that the crypto could potentially slip to $1.37 in the short run if the bearish momentum dominates. Despite that, the market sentiment remained strong towards the crypto, given the recent developments. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X On the other hand, another market expert Dark Defender recently shared an XRP price chart, which showed that the crypto could rally to about $20 in 2025. This has also fueled market sentiment, especially after the recent run of the crypto towards the north. Source: Dark Defender, X Besides, a recent XRP price analysis indicates a potential rally to $10 ahead. Considering all these aspects, it is highly likely that Ripple’s native crypto could soar past its previous ATH of $3.84 through 2025.

At the forefront is Plus Wallet , which offers innovative features that facilitate passive income generation for its users. Its “Swap to Earn” system rewards traders for each currency exchange, and the “Refer to Earn” scheme compensates them for trades conducted by referred users. Moreover, Bitget Wallet has captured attention by integrating the HyperEVM testnet, which simplifies network customization and enhances the user experience. Conversely, El Salvador’s Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, may soon be discontinued or sold following new fiscal strategies prompted by a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Bitget Wallet Enhances User Experience with HyperEVM Integration Bitget Wallet remains a notable player in the Web3 domain, providing an all-encompassing solution for users. It has recently integrated the HyperEVM testnet, revolutionizing access to high-quality decentralized applications (dApps), various projects, and DeFi services. This integration facilitates lending, staking, and commission-free trading, all supported by the $HYPE token. Additionally, the introduction of a Hyperliquid faucet for test tokens improves accessibility and engagement with the blockchain ecosystem, solidifying Bitget Wallet’s position as a leader in user experience innovation within the Web3 space. Uncertain Future for El Salvador’s Chivo Wallet Recent developments have put El Salvador’s digital Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, under the spotlight as the government contemplates its discontinuation or sale. This move aligns with financial adjustments linked to a recent IMF loan. Despite these changes, Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin office, confirmed the nation’s continued investment in Bitcoin, highlighting a sustained commitment to leveraging cryptocurrency for financial innovation. Plus Wallet’s Dual Rewards Mechanism Ensures Steady Passive Income Plus Wallet differentiates itself with innovative reward programs that facilitate continuous passive income through two primary methods. The “Swap to Earn” program is the first, providing USDT rewards for each transaction users complete, aligning well with transactional frequency. The “Refer to Earn” program complements this by allowing users to share a unique referral code or link, thereby amplifying their earnings potential. Each swap completed by a referred participant generates a commission in USDT for the referrer, with the potential for earnings scaling with the number of referrals made. The rapid processing of referral payouts, typically within 24-48 hours, underscores the system’s efficiency and reliability. Although Plus Wallet implements a nominal 0.5% commission on transactions, the value derived from its comprehensive reward structure significantly exceeds this cost. The popularity of Plus Wallet is rising as it enables users to earn extensively through both trading and referrals, without any restrictions on the number of transactions or the amount of income generated. In a forward-looking perspective, Plus Wallet is setting a precedent in the digital crypto wallet industry by merging effective crypto management with substantial reward opportunities. Best Crypto Wallets The dynamic landscape of digital crypto wallets is continuously evolving, providing users with innovative features. Recent developments highlight Bitget Wallet’s strategic adoption of HyperEVM to facilitate easier access to dApps and DeFi services. Meanwhile, the potential discontinuation or sale of El Salvador’s Chivo wallet reflects shifts in the country’s approach to cryptocurrency adoption. Among these updates, Plus Wallet has emerged as a leader by offering unparalleled opportunities for earning through its Swap to Earn and Refer to Earn programs, positioning itself as a top choice for users aiming to optimize their trading activities for additional income. As the market expands, Plus Wallet is setting new benchmarks in user engagement and reward mechanisms.

""Wait for January!

At this point, successful analyst Michael van de Poppe said that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in January and experience a boom in price. Poppe stated that the ETH/BTC parity, which fell to historical lows during the year, could exceed the 0.04 level, and argued that this situation could initiate an Ethereum altcoin rally. Poppe predicted that interest in Ethereum would increase in January with the start of the new year, saying that ETH would rise and Bitcoin would remain weaker against ETH. “I wouldn't be surprised if ETH/BTC exceeds 0.04 in January. There may be inflows in Ethereum and outflows in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's progress through the consolidation phase could initiate an altcoin rally in the Ethereum ecosystem.” Other market analysts, like Poppe, have also noted that spot Ethereum ETFs could outperform Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. At this point, ETF Store president Nate Geraci said in a post, “Net inflows into ETH ETFs are currently the same amount as gold ETFs, but I expect inflows to accelerate.” The ETH/BTC ratio last reached 0.04 on December 8, 2024. When it reached this level, Ethereum was traded at $ 4,018, rising above the critical $ 4,000 psychological level. *This is not investment advice.

38101359,https://finbold.com/?p=222964,1735139197,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,January’s crypto hotlist: Top 3 picks,https://finbold.com/januarys-crypto-hotlist-top-3-picks-2/,"The cryptocurrency market is set to start 2025 with remarkable momentum, riding on a wave of optimism that shaped much of 2024. The approval of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) was a key catalyst, drawing massive capital inflows and capturing the attention of institutional investors across the globe. This surge in confidence, bolstered by blockchain’s growing integration into traditional finance (TradFi) and regulatory clarity under the pro-crypto Trump administration, propelled Bitcoin to a historic milestone— crossing the $100,000 mark . While Bitcoin continues to dominate the spotlight, the broader market is gaining momentum. Solana ( SOL ), XRP , and Sui ( SUI ) stand out as January’s top picks, each uniquely positioned to capitalize on the evolving crypto landscape. Solana (SOL) Solana’s rapid adoption in global markets has secured its place as a top cryptocurrency to watch this year. Brazil’s approval of a spot Solana ETF and the active trading of eight Solana-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) in Europe highlight its institutional appeal. The momentum is expected to expand further into the U.S. market, with several leading investment firms already filing for spot Solana ETFs with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Solana’s robust developer ecosystem is another factor bolstering its appeal. For the first time since 2016, Solana outpaced Ethereum in new developer growth, with an 83% year-on-year increase in 2024, according to Electric Capital. In total, 7,625 new developers joined Solana’s ecosystem, compared to 6,456 for Ethereum. This surge in developer activity has fueled an expanding ecosystem of projects on the Solana network. In fact, Solana briefly surpassed Ethereum in daily network activity on multiple occasions in 2024, including memecoin activity in March and daily fee generation in October. Solana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold With institutional interest ramping up and a robust developer community driving innovation, Solana is positioned to make significant strides next year. XRP XRP is surging on the back of several key developments that have bolstered confidence in its ecosystem. In December 2024, Ripple’s RLUSD—a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar—received final regulatory approval. Adding to the optimism, the re-election of Donald Trump has injected new energy into the cryptocurrency market, with XRP emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries. At the center of this confidence is Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the incoming SEC Chair, a move widely expected to deliver long-awaited regulatory clarity for Ripple Labs, whose legal battle with the SEC has loomed over XRP since 2020. The timing of the SEC’s appeal, scheduled for January 15—just days before Trump’s inauguration—has heightened expectations. With Atkins set to take over, many believe XRP could be freed from its regulatory overhang. This sentiment has already propelled XRP’s price from $0.50 in November to $2.50, driven by optimism surrounding the lawsuit’s outcome, its relisting on major exchanges like Robinhood , and bullish market sentiment following Trump’s election victory. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Looking ahead, XRP’s prospects continue to strengthen. The potential approval of a spot ETF, supported by filings from asset managers like WisdomTree and Bitwise, could attract significant institutional investment in 2025. Combined with its historical resilience, strong partnerships, and a revitalized regulatory environment, XRP is well-positioned for significant growth, making it a top pick for the year ahead. Sui (SUI) Sui has established itself as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 blockchain networks, outpacing even Bitcoin in 2024. Since its launch in May 2023, Sui has achieved remarkable growth, reaching a market cap of $13 billion in just 18 months. This performance has earned it comparisons to Ethereum as “the next Ethereum” and a potential “Solana killer.” Sui’s rapid adoption is evident in its underlying metrics, particularly its total value locked (TVL), which surged to an all-time high of $1.84 billion in December 2024—a clear indication of its traction in DeFi. ‘ Sui has maintained consistent TVL above $1 billion since November, reflecting robust capital inflows and sustained user engagement. Daily decentralized exchange ( DEX ) activity also hit a record $466 million in December, pushing cumulative DEX volume beyond $35 billion. One major catalyst for Sui in 2025 is the launch of the SuiPlay0X1 , a Web3 handheld gaming device that could potentially offer a pathway to mainstream adoption, cementing Sui’s position as a leader in gaming and attracting more users to its ecosystem. Sui’s growth trajectory is also fueled by strategic partnerships. In November 2024, it collaborated with $1.7 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton to explore innovative use cases. It also partnered with Babylon Labs, Lombard, and Cubist to integrate Bitcoin liquidity, unlocking programmable Bitcoin capabilities within its ecosystem. SUI seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Adding to its appeal, Sui has expanded its functionality through key wallet integrations. Recent integrations, including Phantom Wallet and Backpack, have further enhanced Sui’s accessibility and user appeal. As its fundamentals strengthen and market utility expands, Sui is poised to capitalize on its momentum in 2025, setting the stage for continued growth and solidifying its reputation as one of the most promising assets to watch. Despite the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the outlook for Solana, XRP, and Sui remains highly optimistic as we enter 2025. Investors seeking opportunities in the digital asset space should consider these projects while remaining mindful of the risks involved in this dynamic market.

This launch will come one week after the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) granted final approval for the products. It also comes almost a year after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted spot Bitcoin ETF products in the United States. Israeli Bitcoin Fund debut, Key Details These new Israeli products will track the price of BTC and are set to commence operation as from December 31. Noteworthy, the regulator mandated that all six Bitcoin mutual funds starts trading on the same day. According to Isreali newspaper Calcalist, Migdal Capital Markets, More, Ayalon, Phoenix Investment, Meitav and IBI will offer the funds. The management fees for the funds will fall within the range of 1.5% to 0.25%. Out of all six, one particular fund will be actively managed, with the goal of outperforming Bitcoin. One of the funds will directly track BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, giving direct exposure to the US-focused product. For a start, the funds will transact just once a day. On the other hand, future products will trade continuously. Judging by how much the United States has benefited from the debut of spot crypto ETFs, Isreal may be entering into a new phase of digital growth. In a few months, the US, spot Bitcoin ETFs secured more than $35.6 billion of investor cash. However, by the second week of December, the total Assets Under Management (AUM) for the Bitcoin ETF products crossed $100 billion. At this point, market analysts have started projecting that these products may overtake Gold ETFs by the end of the year. The Ethereum counterpart is not doing bad either as BlackRock ETHA recorded ten consecutive days of inflows in mid-December amassing over $1.3 billion. Ethereum ETF growth has compelled crypto analysts to predict that ETH price could reach $15,000 within the next 6 to 8 months. BTC Price Outlook Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,583.53 after registering a 2.13% increase in the last 24 hours. This price level is still a drop drop from its All-time-high (ATH) of around $108,000. Since it previously reached this level, the optimism for further growth filled the ecosystem. In earlier Bitcoin price analysis , market experts like Matrixport teased a potential rally to $160,000 in 2025 From its current level, the coin would need to register more than a 50% increase to attain this price mark. While many hold onto this bullish projection, critics like Peter Schiff sees the coin dropping considerably soon.

While new reports are emerging with price forecasts and expectations for 2025, examining how well previous predictions performed is essential. Several experts and market analysts expected BTC to rally well above $100,000 by the end of the year, while others underestimated the potential effect of the ongoing bull season and predicted that the leading cryptocurrency would remain below $100,000. Regardless, BTC hit a new high of $108,200 about a week ago and was trading at $98,000 by press time. Experts’ BTC Predictions for 2024 Some crypto executives were off the mark with their predictions, while others narrowly missed the target. In October 2023, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of the crypto exchange and derivatives trading platform BitMEX and founder of the family office Maelstrom Fund, forecasted that BTC would end 2024 at around $70,000 based on several economic factors. He also stated that BTC would be worth between $750,000 and $1 million by 2026 as financial assets experience an unprecedented boom. Hayes’ prediction fell short as BTC has traded above $100,000 over the past few weeks. It remains to be seen if the 2026 forecast will come true, although that would be unlikely because the bear season is expected to kick off that year. Hit or Miss? Several industry experts changed their predictions as they monitored Bitcoin market dynamics in this bull season. One such analyst is Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad. He initially predicted that BTC would be worth $300,000 by the end of 2024 but eventually changed his prediction to $105,000 by August 2025. Fortunately, his prediction fell a bit closer to bitcoin’s current price. Another financial executive is venture capital investor Tim Draper, who predicted that BTC would be worth $250,000 by year-end in April but retracted and changed his prediction to $120,000. BTC has yet to rally past $110,000. Furthermore, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of the crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, predicted in 2021 that BTC would surge to $500,000 in 2024. However, in March 2024, the prominent Bitcoin advocate adjusted his year-end forecast to $100,000. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is looking forward to heavier predictions for bitcoin’s future price. Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of the asset manager Ark Invest, says BTC will be worth $500,000 by 2026 and $1 million by 2030. On the other hand, Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of the business intelligence firm and largest corporate BTC holder, MicroStrategy, sees BTC at $13 million by 2045.

Picture this: savvy investors snapping up assets at bargain prices, setting themselves up for massive returns when the market rebounds. Sounds too good to be true? It isn’t. Just look at Warren Buffett during the 1973 crash—he bought the dip and watched his portfolio soar. Fast forward to 2024, and we’re seeing a similar opportunity with the BTFD Coin presale , offering a massive 50% discount for a limited time. Meanwhile, meme coins like Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) and Notcoin (NOT) are making waves with unique stories and strong community backing. BTFD Coin is all the rage, rolling back its Stage 12 price of $0.00013 to Stage 7 pricing at $0.000064—a 50.77% discount—for investors using the code “ BIG50 ”. This rollback is the perfect chance to buy the dip and potentially make an 837.5% ROI before its listing at $0.0006. Add to this its exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and staking rewards, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s turning heads. But let’s not overlook MEW’s massive growth and NOT’s steady resilience in the face of market volatility. Here’s a closer look at why these are the best new meme coins to invest in this week. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution Starts Here When it comes to buying the dip, BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme; it’s a movement. Launched with the ethos of empowering investors to see opportunity in chaos, this token is making waves in the crypto world. Currently, in Stage 12 of its presale, BTFD is offering a jaw-dropping discount by rolling back to Stage 7 pricing at $0.000064. All you need is the code “BIG50” to secure your spot in what’s shaping up to be the next big thing in meme coins. Presale Highlights Over $4.44 million has already been raised, with more than 58 billion tokens sold to over 6,500 holders. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about a community rallying around the opportunity to buy low and hold for massive gains. If you invest $5,000 at the discounted price, you’ll snag 78.125 million tokens. Once BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $46,875—that’s nearly 9x your money. Features That Set BTFD Apart BTFD isn’t just about the presale hype; it’s building a robust ecosystem. The Beta version of its P2E game is live, offering a sneak peek into a world where players can earn rewards while having fun. While the Beta version doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s a sign of bigger things to come. Add to that a staking programme with 90% APY and a referral programme that rewards top participants with extra tokens, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s serious about value. Ready to Join the Movement? Here’s How: Go to the BTFD presale page and connect your wallet. Enter the code “BIG50” to apply the discount. Input your purchase details and hit “Buy Now.” With its strong community, exciting features, and a presale that’s hard to resist, BTFD Coin is a must-have for any crypto enthusiast looking to make the most of market dips. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): The Underdog with a Roaring Past If you’ve ever felt like the underdog, you’ll relate to Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW). This Solana-based meme coin has carved a niche for itself as the anti-dog meme coin, offering a fresh perspective in a market dominated by dog-themed tokens. Over the past nine months, MEW has grown by an impressive 828.5%, thanks to listings on major exchanges like KuCoin. But the journey hasn’t been all smooth sailing. As of December 24, MEW is trading at $0.00657983, down 19.49% over the past week and 34.3% over the past month. Despite these setbacks, its strong community and unique branding make it a contender in the meme coin space. Investors should keep an eye on MEW as it navigates market volatility, offering potential opportunities for those who can ride the waves. Notcoin (NOT): A Tale of Resilience in a Volatile Market Next up is NOT, a meme coin that’s making waves on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. Known for its Telegram-based tap-to-earn game, NOT has built a loyal following among crypto gamers. Currently priced at $0.00662674, NOT has seen its share of ups and downs. Large holders have offloaded positions recently, leading to a downtrend. But July’s bullish divergence hints that the tide could turn. What sets NOT apart is its integration with TON’s gaming ecosystem, offering real utility in a sector that’s often criticised for being all hype. Still, like MEW, NOT faces stiff competition from meme coins with broader ecosystems, like BTFD. Its current price might attract speculative investors, but its lack of a clear long-term vision keeps it a step behind. Conclusion When it comes to the best new meme coins to invest in this week, BTFD Coin, MEW, and NOT each bring something unique to the table. BTFD’s presale, with its 50% discount and exciting features like a P2E game and staking rewards, makes it the standout choice for those looking to buy the dip and ride the next bull wave. MEW’s growth story and NOT’s resilience add depth to the meme coin landscape, offering opportunities for diversification and long-term potential. Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. Don’t miss your chance to join the presale and secure your stake in what could be the next big meme coin success story. Head to the presale page now, enter the code “BIG50” , and make your move. These opportunities don’t come around often, so act fast and be part of the next crypto revolution.

A trend has formed where Ethereum (ETH) is still the leader in nominal value locked, but has a smaller share of the DeFi market as a whole. The DeFi market is shifting, as Ethereum (ETH) was joined by several other chains with successful financial apps. At the end of 2023, the influence of Ethereum over the entire DeFi sector was at 72.2%. Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi was at $109B, still affected by the bear market. In the past 12 months, the total value locked ranged between $125B and up to $275B , depending on the method of reporting. DeFi added more active new chains in 2024 The BNB Chain remained a low-key staple of the DeFi space, with an unchanged 4.5% market share, the same as the end of 2024. Solana achieved slight growth, from 3.6% at the end of last year to 6.7% of the market at the end of 2024. Solana’s bid for DeFi success came from DEX activity, as well as the attempt to create a native form of liquid staking and liquid re-staking. Solana boosted its transaction count and value locked based on increased DEX traffic from swapping meme tokens. The other big shift in 2024 is the appearance of Bitcoin-based DeFi sector. Currently, up to 5.6% of all value is locked in BTC-based DeFi. Babylon Labs holds the biggest share, with $5.59B in self-custodied BTC staking. The current form of Bitcoin-based DeFi did not take off from the proposed L2 projects, which ended up with almost no value locked. The appeal of Babylon Labs lies in the ability to unlock BTC at any moment, with no need for bridging. TRON is the other big shift in DeFi. The chain first appeared as a DeFi hub in 2022, and currently has a 6% market share. TRON reached a peak of 6.5% of the DeFi market at the end of 2023, with a share of 6.5%. The TRON ecosystem grew based on crypto-collateral lending, in addition to the $60B in stablecoin liquidity. Arbitrum was one of the go-to chains during the 2022-2023 bear market, but did not graduate to a major chain. It became a part of the mix of minor chains with early-stage DeFi. The big change in 2024 affected smaller chains, which make up an estimated 21.6% of all DeFi value. Just a year ago, minor chains made up 10.4% of DeFi value locked. Base, Sui and Aptos emerged as alternatives to Ethereum, offering low costs and innovation. In the last days of 2024, Hyperliquid trended, after the launch of its native HYPE token. The new super-fast chains are focusing on trading opportunities, gaining liquidity with targeted high-activity pairs. Ethereum still leads DeFi with its collateral influence Ethereum (ETH) still carries more than $70B in value locked, due to being used as collateral. ETH bridged to Binance Smart Chain is also driving the value of DeFi. DeFi on Ethereum is high-value due to the model of most apps, which require large-scale collaterals or another form of locking ETH. Liquid staking from LidoDAO built the biggest ETH reserve. Aave (AAVE) rose to the second spot, after becoming the leading lending protocol in 2024. Ethereum-based DeFi remains a strong proposition, as there are still expectations for an ETH rally to a higher range. The new year is usually a historically strong period for ETH , potentially raising the value locked in all DeFi apps. ETH retained its value at $3,494.45, with strong support at $3,400. For now, the DeFi sector is safe, as most of the collaterals have been deposited at a much lower price range. The other reason for the growth of Ethereum-based DeFi is the inflow of Tether (USDT) as an ERC-20 token. The supply of ERC-20 USDT expanded to 79.92B tokens, swapping some of the TRON-based and niche chain versions due to liquidity demand.

While the asset remains under correction, the price looks weak following an 8% drop in 7 days. Unlike many top altcoins, XRP has not seen much change since last week because of low trading volatility. The price currently looks indecisive on the daily chart as it continues to stay in a retracement phase. This phase, which came after testing the $2.9 level earlier this month, is still considered minor compared to what ETH, BNB and SOL experienced during the last leg down. These altcoins have provided a notable discount and are now looking set for major recovery from a technical standpoint. The minor retracement suggests a strong conviction for a bigger rally amongst the long-term buyers (whales) as they reaccumulate while the weak hands sell off positions. Once the reaccumulation ends, we can expect a sudden price movement above the falling resistance line that prevented the bulls since the start of the month. This could catch many traders unaware as they FOMO along. A dump in the price could provide a bigger discount for a long-term buy. Though, trading may look uninteresting for some days, but the market structure is still considered bullish on the daily chart. While the overall market may enter an anaemic state as the year runs to an end, XRP remains the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap since it occupied that spot last month. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Taking advantage of the latest recovery, XRP may reclaim $2.5 before flipping the resistance line to $2.7. The main resistance for a such move is $2.9, followed by a break to the all-time high of $3.3. For a broader retracement move, the price must fall below the holding $1.9 support before testing a lower support of $1.63 and $1.28. Key Resistance Levels: $2.7, $2.9, $3.3 Key Support Levels: $1.9, $1.63, $1.28 Spot Price: $2.29 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ki Young Ju tells his 389,600 followers on the social media platform X that $790 billion in realized capital inflows have ballooned Bitcoin’s market cap to $2 trillion over the past 15 years. “This year alone, $352 billion in inflows have added $1 trillion to its market cap. However, using a pumpable asset like Bitcoin to offset dollar-denominated debt—rather than gold or dollars—could make gaining creditors’ consensus challenging. For Bitcoin to achieve broader market acceptance, Bitcoin must attain global, nationwide authority on par with gold. Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) could serve as a symbolic first step. With 70% of U.S. debt held domestically, offsetting 36% of it by acquiring 1 million Bitcoin by 2050 becomes feasible if the U.S. government designates Bitcoin as a strategic asset.” The CryptoQuant CEO adds that the 30% of debt held by foreign entities might resist that approach, but he argues that the strategy remains practical nonetheless. “If a consensus is reached on Bitcoin’s status, achieving this is entirely possible. The only risk would be old whales dumping BTC to attack the US. However, if governments continue accumulating Bitcoin until 2050 and its price keeps rising, I doubt they would actually dump it.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider VanEck, initially outlined how a strategic Bitcoin reserve could offset US debt. “Assume the US Treasury starts buying one million Bitcoin over five years at a starting price of $200,000. Assume US debt grows at 5% (vs. last 10 years 8% compound annual growth rate) and BTC price compounds at 25%. In such a scenario, the US Strategic BTC Reserve would hold assets equivalent to 36% of debt by 2050. In that scenario, BTC would be $42 million/coin (same as Michael Saylor’s target, coincidentally) and the market cap would be 18% of global financial assets. But even at a 15% compound annual growth rate, the BTC stash would still be quite valuable.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

TRX found a temporal support level and now slowly shows signs of strength, potential rally ahead. The early month explosion saw TRX price through a major milestone as it rallied by 100% in a single day to test exactly $0.45. Unfortunately, it lost buzz due to rejection and was dumped, ending the first week in loss. It dumped harder this month amid rising supply and the price corrected deeply to as low as $0.22 during last week’s meltdown. The crypto mounted support there and increased slightly amid this week’s recovery. Closing Monday bullish for the first time in a week, TRX is now sitting well above the $0.25 level as capital gradually flows back into the market. From the look of things, it appeared to have ended correction on a daily scale and if more money rolls in, we can expect a bigger price recovery. However, if the crypto loses momentum again due to rising supply, the price will continue to correct until it finds a firm support level for a fresh increase. As it stands now, the demand level appears low. Regardless of that, the trend remains bullish in the long term following a 5x rally in the last two years. The price can hit $1 if the adoption rate rises during this bull cycle. TRX’s Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview Moving higher, the $0.225 level is an immediate resistance to watch along with the $0.31 level. A push from there could bring a full recovery to $0.37 and the $0.45 resistance level with a potential break up. Losing grip above last week’s $0.225 low could fuel another leg down to the $0.186 support level. Right below it lies the $0.17 level that flipped as resistance during last month’s surge.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 15:35:17

Bitget Exchange Token Climbs to 23rd Place in BGB Cryptocurrency Ranking, Breaks New Record Impressive Market Performance Circulating Market Value: $7.55 billion Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV): $10.79 billion 24 Hour High: 5.78 USDT 24 Hour Growth: +15.18% Monthly Growth: +224.13% BGB’s meteoric rise has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, with the token reaching an all-time high of $5.78 USDT. Its significant gains over the last 24 hours, combined with an impressive 224.13% increase over the past month, underscore its growing importance in the crypto ecosystem. Driving Factors Behind BGB's Rise The token’s rise can be attributed to a combination of factors: Increased Trading Volume: Bitget’s exchange platform has seen an increase in user activity and liquidity, increasing demand for its native token. Utility and Adoption: BGB’s use of trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and special platform features has increased its usage and appeal. Market Momentum: The broader cryptocurrency market rally has provided additional tailwinds for tokens with strong exchange utility.

Centralized servers, which store private keys, were frequently attacked, highlighting a significant vulnerability. In such a perilous digital landscape, securing a highly protective crypto wallet is crucial for safeguarding digital assets. Yet, optimal security must be balanced with additional features like cross-chain compatibility and ease of use. This article outlines the leading secure crypto wallets of the year—Plus Wallet, Exodus, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet—designed to offer top-notch security while enhancing user experience with added functionality. 1. Plus Wallet: Premier Security Meets Unlimited Earning Potential Plus Wallet distinguishes itself as a top contender among secure crypto wallets, combining stringent security measures and cross-chain functionality within a user-friendly interface. It uses self-custody storage, ensuring that private keys remain on the user’s device, which provides complete control and protection against external breaches. It supports two-factor authentication, including Face ID and PIN codes, adding an extra layer of security. For additional safety, users can create a recovery phrase to regain access if needed. Moreover, Plus Wallet enriches user experience by offering limitless rewards through its Swap to Earn and Refer to Earn programs, allowing users to earn on every transaction without any caps on the activity. By merging rigorous security protocols with enticing user rewards, Plus Wallet caters to those seeking both robust protection and financial incentives. 2. Trust Wallet: A Versatile Platform for Multiple Crypto Assets As an affiliate of Binance, Trust Wallet enables direct purchases, sales, and exchanges of cryptocurrencies from the app. It supports over 100 blockchains and integrates smoothly with decentralized applications (dApps), offering access to DeFi platforms, gaming, and NFT markets. This integration enhances overall functionality, making it easier for users to engage with diverse crypto services. However, its connection to the centralized entity Binance might deter those desiring a fully decentralized wallet solution. 3. Exodus: Simplified Crypto Management with External Hardware Support Exodus stands out by offering an integrated suite of applications for managing cryptocurrencies, accessible via mobile, desktop, and a web extension. Notably, it connects seamlessly with Trezor, facilitating easy crypto transfers from hot to cold storage, enhancing security significantly. While Exodus is free and provides a wealth of educational resources, its status as closed-source software could be a downside for those who prefer open-source solutions for greater transparency and security assurance. 4. Coinbase Wallet: User-Friendly Interface with Direct Exchange Access Coinbase Wallet operates independently from its exchange counterpart, allowing users to manage their cryptocurrencies separately from the exchange. The wallet’s user-friendly design and integration with Coinbase’s exchange services make it an attractive option for newcomers to non-custodial wallets. It supports various decentralized applications and provides smooth transactions of assets like Solana. Nonetheless, its close ties with the centralized Coinbase exchange could be less appealing for those prioritizing decentralization. Choosing the Most Secure Crypto Wallet Each wallet listed here is recognized for its strong security features, yet they cater to diverse preferences and needs. Coinbase Wallet is particularly beneficial for those already using Coinbase’s services, due to its integration. Trust Wallet offers broad access to various cryptocurrencies and services, although its association with Binance may not suit everyone’s taste. Exodus is an excellent choice for those interested in combining hot and cold storage solutions, and Plus Wallet excels in providing both superior security and flexibility, making it the most secure crypto wallet for users interested in exploring new projects and earning passive income.

However, some cryptocurrencies outperformed others, led by strong momentum and favorable narratives, which could happen again in Q1 2025. In this context, Finbold turned to Grok 2, an artificial intelligence model (AI) designed by Elon Musk ’s company xAI . We asked Grok to pick two cryptocurrencies that have a good chance of outperforming the market in 2025’s first quarter. The xAI most-advanced model was used given its ability to scan X and the web for up-to-date data and analysis. Some experts believe Grok AI could one day replace Google due to its real-time scanning feature and accuracy. Grok AI is bullish on Ethereum (ETH) for Q1 2025 As a response , Grok AI first picked Ethereum ( ETH ) as a promising cryptocurrency for Q1 2025, expecting an altseason. In particular, the model considered seven posts and 15 web pages while delivering this result. Ethereum has shown significant growth and still plays a key role in decentralized finance ( DeFi ), benefiting from positive network effects. On that note, Grok found three analyses that anticipate ETH will continue its upward trajectory to new all-time highs. “This is supported by its established developer community, wide adoption in decentralized applications, and the increasing interest in Ethereum-based NFTs and DeFi protocols.” – Grok AI Grok 2 picks Ethereum (ETH) to outperform other cryptocurrencies in Q1 2025. Source: Finbold / Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) Grok AI picks Solana (SOL) to outperform other cryptocurrencies Notably, Grok’s second pick is Solana ( SOL ), which is getting the spotlight for its “high transaction throughput and low costs.” According to the analyses, Solana has proven a strong contender against Ethereum’s DeFi and NFT dominance, conquering significant market share. SOL was one of the best performers in 2023 and also in 2024, displaying solid momentum among the top cryptocurrencies. Grok believes Solana can do it again in the first quarter of 2025. “Solana’s ecosystem has been expanding, with growing interest from both developers and investors due to its speed and scalability. Various sources indicate that Solana might see considerable growth due to its fundamental strengths and the momentum from its recent market performance.” – Grok AI Grok 2 picks Solana (SOL) to outperform other cryptocurrencies in Q1 2025. Source: Finbold / Vini Barbosa (@vinibarbosabr) Nevertheless, Grok can always make mistakes, and investors should not consider this analysis alone when making financial decisions. As disclosed, these cryptocurrencies have established market presence and ongoing technological advancements, benefiting from positive market sentiment, but other projects could surge in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency market as we move into 2025.

Table of Contents DOGEN: The ultimate memetoken for alphas who demand the best Toncoin: Potential growth and price predictions to 2030 Aptos: A scalable blockchain using Move programming language Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing with flash loans Uniswap’s UNI token: Governance in decentralized exchange Solana: A high-speed blockchain platform for scalable DApps Conclusion Cryptocurrency markets are constantly changing, and investors seek the next big opportunity. In this dynamic environment, some lesser-known digital coins are showing great promise for future growth. This article highlights six altcoins that could deliver significant returns by 2025. Explore these potential game-changers and stay ahead in the evolving crypto landscape. DOGEN: The ultimate memetoken for alphas who demand the best Unleash your inner alpha with DOGEN , the memetoken crafted for those who aspire to live life on their own terms. Designed for winners who never settle, DOGEN is the ultimate token for those who crave more — luxury cars, overflowing cash, and the lifestyle others only dream about. This is the Alpha DOGEN way, where every move is a power play. You might also like: ETH and FLOKI set for breakouts, DOGEN smashes records with $4M presale HODL like a boss, dominate the market Ready to step into the Alpha DOGEN lifestyle and claim the finer things in life? DOGEN is ready for takeoff, with a projected 700% surge by the end of its presale — and that’s just the beginning. As meme tokens lead the charge in this altcoin season, DOGEN is on track to deliver legendary thousand-fold returns. The earlier someone joins, the their your gains. This isn’t just an investment; it’s a statement. Others will be left watching from the sidelines as early investors rise to the top of the pack. Missed out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the next big player in the Solana memetoken ecosystem, standing tall with icons like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, all of which have achieved stunning 1000% growth. Undervalued and underappreciated — for now — DOGEN is set to rewrite the narrative, with the bull run positioning it as a record-breaking contender. A community that delivers real value This isn’t just hype; DOGEN is a movement. Backed by a dedicated team, DOGEN is focused on fostering a thriving community of alpha leaders who know how to dominate. With exclusive campaigns, enticing perks, and a commitment to lasting value, DOGEN is more than a token, it’s a long-term opportunity. The multi-level referral program is as bold as the token itself. Users earn 7% from every token their direct recruits (1st level) buy using their referral code, and watch their rewards grow as the network expands. The more users you bring in, the more profits stacked — it’s a system designed for leaders who know how to win. Toncoin: Potential growth and price predictions to 2030 Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized, open-source layer-1 blockchain. Originally developed by Telegram, the project is now led by the TON Foundation. Toncoin uses a proof-of-stake model, aiming for scalability and reliability. It offers fast, secure payments with low fees and plans to develop a comprehensive ecosystem with decentralized services. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Toncoin’s price could reach up to $30.30 by 2025 and $26.04 by 2030. Compared to today’s price, this suggests significant potential growth. In the current market cycle, Toncoin appears attractive due to its technology and projected price increases. Aptos: A scalable blockchain using Move programming language Aptos (APT) is a new layer-one blockchain designed to tackle high transaction fees and network congestion. It was developed by Aptos Labs, founded by core contributors from Meta’s Diem project. Aptos uses the Move programming language for smart contracts, emphasizing safety and flexibility. It operates with a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and supports various Web3 applications. The technology aims for scalability and reliability. In the current market cycle, Aptos offers potential as an emerging platform addressing existing blockchain limitations. Aave: Decentralized lending and borrowing with flash loans Aave is a decentralized finance platform on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. It supports 17 cryptocurrencies for lending and borrowing. Users earn interest through aTokens. A unique feature is flash loans, which are instant loans without collateral that must be repaid within the same block. The AAVE token offers benefits like fee reductions and voting rights, and it can be used as collateral. The platform’s Safety Module allows staking for risk mitigation. With a limited supply and deflationary mechanisms, AAVE may have growth potential. In the current market cycle, Aave’s innovative features could make it an attractive option. Uniswap’s UNI token: Governance in decentralized exchange Uniswap’s UNI token is a governance token launched in September 2020. It allows holders to vote on platform developments like fee structures and token distribution. This move came after competition from SushiSwap. Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, with each receiving 400 UNI tokens worth over $1,000 at launch. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain, operating since 2018. It uses an automated liquidity protocol, enabling trading without an order book and giving users control of their funds. Its open-source nature and free token listing set it apart. Uniswap is the fourth-largest DeFi platform with over $3 billion in assets. The UNI token’s role in governance and the platform’s innovation make it potentially attractive in the current market cycle. Solana: A high-speed blockchain platform for scalable DApps Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, focusing on fast transactions and support for decentralized applications. It competes with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano but stands out by avoiding sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana’s architecture allows developers to build applications using different programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the network, enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding participants. SOL holds value as it supports the Solana ecosystem and provides access to various projects on the platform. With its high-capacity network and potential for hosting high-activity services, Solana has gained attention from developers and investors, making SOL a notable coin in the current market. Conclusion While TON, APT, AAVE, and UNI may offer less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

38102843,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667022,1735142426,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Analyst Puts Target Above $0.37",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-symmetrical/,"A crypto analyst, known as ‘CryptoSanders9563’, disclosed in a report on TradingView that the Dogecoin price has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern, signaling a bullish continuation for Dogecoin, is expected to trigger a price surge to a new target above $0.375. Symmetrical Triangle To Drive Dogecoin Price Above $0.37 CryptoSanders has shared a Dogecoin price chart, showing a symmetrical triangle pattern formed by converging trendlines. According to the TradingView analyst, Dogecoin’s price broke above the symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline at approximately $0.316, confirming a bullish breakout and signaling a potential surge to a new price target above $0.375. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Recover To $107,000 Again If This Important Level Is Broken A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern that signals a period of consolidation before a price breakout. When the price of a cryptocurrency experiences a breakout from this pattern, it often indicates the start of a new trend or a continuation of a former trend. As a result, breaking out of the lower trendline marks the beginning of a bearish phase and vice versa. CryptoSanders has revealed that Dogecoin’s price breakout is accompanied by continued price action above critical moving averages, further strengthening its bullish setup. At the time of the analyst’s report, the Dogecoin price was trading above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 200-EMA. These two moving averages are critical indicators that suggest a continued upward momentum in the Dogecoin price. The TradingView analyst has surmised that converging both moving averages could be a dynamic support for Dogecoin, potentially fortifying its upside momentum. Following the recent breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern, the analyst has pinpointed $0.375 as Dogecoin’s next significant resistance level. This price point is also a psychological level for Dogecoin, triggering profit-taking for investors. If the Dogecoin price can break above the $0.375 resistance level, it could trigger a more substantial price rally to new highs. However, a failure to breach this level could catalyze another downtrend, potentially pushing Dogecoin’s price to the $0.306 support level. Dogecoin Trade Setup and Strategy While sharing his optimistic projection for Dogecoin’s price trajectory, CryptoSanders also outlined a well-defined trade strategy for investors looking to capitalize on this symmetrical triangle breakout. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Wave 2 And 5 Targets Put XRP At $7 And $13 The analyst pinpointed an entry zone at the $0.316 price level after the confirmation of the breakout. A stop loss of $0.306 has been set to mitigate downside risk and avoid financial loss in the event of a failed breakout. Furthermore, the previously projected target of $0.375 has been reaffirmed as the primary profit-taking zone, coinciding with the highlighted resistance area on the chart. CryptoSanders has revealed that this trade setup offers a favorable risk-to-reward ratio. Investors can potentially earn a significant profit as long as the price of Dogecoin holds above the breakout level and the stop loss is respected.

Solana set for a surge amid incoming altcoin season Solana (SOL) is showing signs of potential growth despite recent dips. Its current price ranges between $160.72 and $214.48. The nearest resistance level is at $249, and breaking this could propel the price higher towards $302. The relative strength index is at 38.17, indicating that SOL is nearing oversold territory. The stochastic indicator is low at 16.72, which often precedes price increases. While the 1-week and 1-month price changes are down by over 20% and 30% respectively, the 6-month change remains positive at 30.16%. With the altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run expected, Solana could see significant upward movement soon. Cosmos gears up for potential breakout ahead of altcoin season Cosmos (ATOM) is showing signs of a possible upward move. Trading between $5.06 and $8.52, it’s below the 100-day simple moving average of $6.82. The Relative Strength Index is around 38, indicating it’s nearing oversold territory. This could lead to increased buying interest. If ATOM surpasses the nearest resistance at $10, it may target the next level at $14. This would be an increase of over 60% from current prices. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, Cosmos has the potential for significant growth in the coming period. CHILLGUY set to break resistance amid upcoming altcoin season Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY) is trading between $0.10 and $0.33, showing signs of consolidation. The RSI is at 49.59, indicating the market is ready for a move. The Stochastic oscillator is low at 15.39, suggesting the coin is oversold and could rebound soon. With the MACD level positive at 0.0018, momentum might be shifting upwards. The next resistance is at $0.47, and breaking this could see CHILLGUY reaching $0.70, which would be over a 100% gain from current levels. With altcoin season approaching, CHILLGUY could be poised for significant growth despite recent declines. Polkadot poised for surge amid incoming altcoin season Polkadot (DOT) is showing signs of upward momentum despite a recent weekly dip of over 25%. Currently trading near the lower end of its price range, indicators suggest a potential reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 38, hinting at an oversold condition. The stochastic oscillator is also low, indicating possible bullish activity ahead. If DOT can break through the nearest resistance level at $10, it could target the next resistance at $13.63. This move would represent a significant gain of more than 50% from current levels. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, Polkadot might be ready to capitalize on market optimism. Conclusion While SOL, ATOM, CHILLGUY, and DOT may offer less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features — governance, rewards, and staking — Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and reach new heights.

Recent on-chain data and market trends indicate a considerable surge in market interest in ETH, suggesting that the token could scale unseen price levels in 2025. Here’s a brief report encompassing potential factors that underscore phenomenal gains for ETH ahead, including rising institutional interest, declining exchange supply, and a stockpile of other bullish indicators. Here’s Why Ethereum Price Could See Unseen Levels In 2025 Amid a flurry of positive market developments, including robust institutional demand, declining exchange supply, and strong market technicals, crypto watchers are eagerly anticipating remarkable gains in Ethereum price ahead. Firstly, spot ETH ETFs recorded remarkable inflows over the past few days, underlining rising institutional interest. As per data by Sosovalue , the overall inflows as of December 24 totaled $2.51 billion for the crypto, whereas the daily inflows on Tuesday were evaluated to be around $53 million, sparking market optimism for the token. Further, ETH outflows from exchanges are reportedly rising, signaling that investors are accumulating. The rising institutional interest and declining exchange supply flagged heightened market interest in the asset, paving a bullish path for the asset’s future movements. Further, a recent X post by renowned crypto enthusiast Michaël van de Poppe revealed that the bear market has ended for altcoins. In light of this bullish anticipation, the same analyst also pointed out a $15-25K price target for the second-largest crypto by market cap ahead. Moreover, per the same analyst, the total market capitalization at the moment is barely $1.5 trillion. The expected bubble is to be around 10-15 trillion, hinting at phenomenal gains for the broader sector ahead. In addition, recent CoinShares data indicated that Ethereum saw $51.3 million worth of inflows weekly, with $2.3 billion worth of inflows as of Month-to-Date. This data underscored that ETH outperformed assets like BTC and SOL amid heightened market interest. Also, recent data by Whale Alert of December 25 indicated that a whale accumulated a staggering 20,000 coins worth $ 69.87 million from the Turkish cryptocurrency exchange, BTCTurk. Overall, the abovementioned factors have ignited a tidal wave of optimism for future action on the Ethereum price. ETH Eyes Massive Rally? ETH price today slipped nearly 1% and traded at $3,472. Its 24-hour low and high were recorded as $3,432.42 and $3,542.83, respectively. The coin’s weekly chart indicated a 10% drop, underlining the recent market volatility. Nevertheless, market watchers remain bullish on the asset’s long-term prospects in light of the abovementioned aspects. A recent Ethereum price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the coin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator slipped to 1.54. This data further indicates that the asset is still undervalued. In addition, a recent CoinGape report revealed that VanEck predicted a new ATH for ETH in 2025, fueled by U.S. adoption, innovations, and AI integration in blockchain. Moreover, renowned asset manager Bitwise anticipated that the crypto would hit a new ATH next year. Altogether, in the wake of the notably heightened market interest and strong market technicals, market watchers anticipate unseens levels in Ethereum price ahead.

What this means is that the AI-driven venture capital DAO has finally emerged as a strong force in DeFi. A recent transaction by a crypto whale further underlines the growing influence of the project. The whale bought 2.86 million $AI6Z tokens valued at $2.58 million at an average price of $0.90 per token. As a result of the acquisition, the whale’s main wallet now contains 15.6 million $AI6Z tokens and is worth about $14.93 million. Large-scale accumulation like this shows the immense confidence of the market in AI16Z’s potential to redefine the future of venture capital with AI-driven innovation. Eliza Plugin Integration Expands Functionality Adding to the excitement , ai16z recently integrated the Abstract plugin into its Eliza platform, a decentralized AI-powered framework. This plugin enables users to automate Ethereum and ERC20 token transfers within the Abstract testnet environment. By simply configuring commands, users can streamline token transactions, making blockchain interactions more efficient and user-friendly. This upgrade significantly increases Eliza’s functionality on the platform, making it really versatile within them ecosystem. Pragmatic innovations like this will continue to cement the value of ai16z to a wide range of users and developers with increased blockchain adoption. AI Meets Decentralized Venture Capital ai16z is a first-of-its-kind venture capital combining artificial intelligence with decentralized governance. While many funds are controlled by a person or a group of persons, ai16z operates via a DAO. Drawing inspiration from Marc Andreessen’s investment philosophy, the project uses AI to refine and improve decision-making processes. The $AI6Z token is used for governance and utility purposes. Such holders will be able to vote in the most important strategic decisions, allowing the community to have its voice heard in the project’s decision-making. This approach empowers stakeholders and maximizes token utility within the ecosystem . Redesigning Blockchain Ecosystems The rapid rise of ai16z puts a spotlight on the power of innovation in AI and DeFi to transform blockchain ecosystems. ai16z is differentiated by strategic whale activity, integrations that are truly groundbreaking, such as the Eliza plugin, and its unique governance model. With the redefinition of venture capital, ai16z is ready to push the boundaries of decentralized technology in leading the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation. With a market cap of US$1 billion, ai16z exemplifies the potential of AI-driven decentralized ecosystems to disrupt traditional industries.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-25 16:43:00

However, despite the bullish trends, the impressive performance hasn’t translated into gains for publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies, with many of their stocks showing significant declines. Mining Stocks Falter Despite Market Gains Data from the Hashrate Index shows that several major players in the sector are experiencing downturns. The biggest losses were recorded by Argo Blockchain. The stock of the UK-based BTC miner with a 1,500 PH/s hashrate has plunged 84.31% year-to-date (YTD), accompanied by a 5% dip over 24 hours. Greenidge, which operates two main data centers in Dresden, New York, and Spartanburg, South Carolina, also suffered major losses, going down nearly 9% in the last day and more than 74% YTD. Other poorly performing stocks included Sphere 3D, whose market cap fell to $23 million after share prices dipped by 4.22% overnight and 71.32% since the year began. Mawson Infrastructure Group and Ebang International also registered 70% and 53% drops in their YTD values, respectively, with the same scenario replicated in their 24-hour performances, where both fell more than 4%. Bigger capped firms such as Riot Platforms, with a recorded hashrate of 29,400 PH/s, also posted notable losses, sliding almost 8% in the last day and 29.92% YTD. On its part, Marathon Digital reported a 3.56% reduction over 24 hours and a more significant 16.05% from the year’s start. Outliers Reaping From Bitcoin’s Surge On the brighter side, companies like TeraWulf bucked the trend, posting a YTD surge of 152.61%, pushing its stock price to $5.81. Interestingly, it suffered the worst one-day dip of all BTC-miner stocks, shedding more than 12% from its price in that period. Similarly, Bitdeer gained 131% across 12 months, boosted by a slight 0.15% increase in the last 24 hours to breach the $20 mark. Other stocks that showcased resilience included Hut 8 Mining and Northern Data, with a combined hashrate of 8,400 PH/s, whose prices have jumped 71.83% and 65.73% in that order. This divergence between BTC’s bullish run and the mining sector’s struggles highlights the complexity of virtual asset investment. It continues to dominate the crypto market, with a 5% increase since December 24, to push its price to just below $99,000. However, the world’s largest virtual asset by market cap is down 5.6% across seven days, balanced by the 128% it has gained since January. Elsewhere, statistics recently shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju revealed that institutional holders of the OG crypto have spiked to 31% from only 14% in 2023. The uptick has been driven by the growing popularity of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), government acquisitions, and the effect of MicroStrategy’s BTC-buying spree.

With the correct selections, a $500 investment might turn into $75,000 before SOL hits its high point. Rexas Finance (RXS), Sui, and Cardano (ADA) are among the most forward-looking substitutes. Although each offers unique advantages, Rexas Finance is the best choice for anyone looking for transforming results. Sui (SUI) Among the most scalable blockchain systems available on the market, Sui is quickly becoming well-known. Sui started at $1.4 and has grown by 227%, with a current trading price of $4.58, according to coinmarketcap. With a market cap worth $13.37 billion, it offers significant future expansion space. Sui's established position partially offsets her potential for quick exponential expansion, even with her great start and strong foundations. Cardano (ADA) Enabling interoperability, sustainability and scalability in blockchain, Cardano has been providing value in the ecosystem as a key player owing to trading at $1.02 today while consistently growing from the start of the year where its price was $0.59 thereby increasing by 73% year to date. With a $35.97 billion market value, Cardano has shown itself to be a consistent investment, especially for those looking for consistency. Nevertheless, its ability to provide quick benefits in the near term is limited by its large market capitalization and slower development rate than recent initiatives. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Breakout Star Conversely, Rexas Finance is shown to be a fascinating competitor. This presents unmatched growth potential at just $0.15 in its 10th presale. With its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization—which lets consumers tokenize valuable assets such as intellectual property, fine art, and real estate, Rexas is creating waves. This utility-driven approach gives the token inherent worth, elevating it above mere speculative investment. Rexas already shows great market confidence with over $30.8 million raised and 364.7 million tokens sold. Early investors can see exponential returns as analysts estimate the token can soar to $3 soon after its debut. Besides its innovative use, Rexas has acquired a reputation using its CertiK audit, guaranteeing top-notch security and openness. Its ratings among professional investors have been strengthened even more by its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The ongoing $1 million contest, in which twenty winners will get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, has created significant buzz and attracted much project interest. With a whole ecosystem, including the Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder, Rexas Finance is also meant for long-term sustainability. These instruments enable companies and developers to tokenize assets, guaranteeing ongoing innovation and acceptance on its platform.

38104494,https://finbold.com/?p=222981,1735145964,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Shiba Inu flashes new buy signal; Is rebound imminent?,https://finbold.com/shiba-inu-flashes-new-buy-signal-is-rebound-imminent/,"Meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) is witnessing a short-term price correction, but technical indicators suggest that the coin might target new highs. Specifically, SHIB’s TD Sequential indicator flashed a fresh buy signal on its daily chart, raising the possibility of the token targeting new resistance levels in the short term, according to insights shared by prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on December 24. The TD Sequential is used to identify trend exhaustion and potential reversals. It consists of a series of candlestick patterns, and in Shiba Inu’s case, the formation suggests that the current downtrend may be nearing its end. SHIB price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts According to Martinez, with SHIB currently trading near $0.00002307, the buy signal hints at a possible rally toward the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, approximately $0.000026. If buying pressure intensifies, SHIB could aim for the next resistance at $0.000029, corresponding to the 0.236 Fibonacci level. X trading expert Javon Marks also highlighted the bullish sentiment, stating that SHIB’s technical layout indicates the possibility of claiming the $0.000081 level. This would mark a 3.33-fold surge, reflecting a more than 234% climb from its current levels. SHIB price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Indeed, SHIB has formed a descending wedge pattern, a bullish reversal formation. This pattern was followed by a breakout to the upside, indicating the possibility of further gains. After consolidating, SHIB has begun forming higher lows, showing strong resilience and buyer confidence. Possible reprieve for SHIB after sell-off The bullish outlook may relieve Shiba Inu investors, considering that the meme coin has witnessed sustained trading sessions of losses that have largely mirrored the general cryptocurrency market. At the same time, the current SHIB investors’ profits and losses might offer insights into what to expect from the coin. In this case, data retrieved by Finbold from crypto onchain analysis platform IntoTheBlock on December 25 indicates that 55% of Shiba Inu holders are in profit, 8% are at breakeven, and 37% are at a loss. SHIB holders making moneyt at the current price. Source: IntoTheBlock Profit-taking by the majority could create selling pressure, capping price growth, while losses for 37% of holders may reduce selling activity, providing price stability. Meanwhile, the investors at breakeven might add short-term resistance if they sell as prices rise. Besides the technical outlook, SHIB will be banking on network-specific elements that are likely to spur possible price growth. For instance, the network’s layer-two scaling solution, Shibarium, is taking center stage with notable milestones. On December 25, the platform surpassed 700 million total transactions since its launch last summer, pointing to the rapid adoption of the protocol. The milestone has come with several additional developments, such as a revamped user interface to enhance compatibility with wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Additionally, a hard fork introduced faster block processing and empowered developers, while a refined burning mechanism aims to reduce token supply. SHIB price analysis By press time, SHIB was trading at $0.000022, down 2% in the last 24 hours. The meme coin has plunged almost 10% on the weekly time frame. SHIB seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Shiba Inu’s technical setup suggests that the coin will likely witness more bearish sentiments in the short term since the current price is below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) but remains above its 200-day SMA, signaling a positive long-term trend. The relative strength index (RSI) at 47.31 is neutral, suggesting no overbought or oversold conditions, while moderate volatility (11.38%) hints at stable fluctuations.

According to a report by the Calcalist on Wednesday, Dec. 25, the Israel Securities Authority has given the green light for six mutual funds that will track the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ). ISA’s approval of the funds last week paved the way for their debut on Dec. 31, the report stated. Cacalist’s report reveals that ISA expects all six funds – from Migdal Capital Markets, More, Ayalon, Phoenix Investment, Meitav and IBI – to go live at the same time. The simultaneous launch is a condition the regulator outlined for the providers.

Also notable is that one of the new funds is actively managed, with transacting initially set for once a day. The imminent launch of BTC mutual funds in Israel is coming as the crypto industry welcomes greater participation from institutional investors. United States, Europe, Hong Kong, and Australia all made huge strides in 2024, with Bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded products hitting the respective markets and causing massive adoption. In January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission kicked off the uptrend with approval for multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since the ETFs have gobbled billions of dollars in BTC. SoSoValue data shows net assets in U.S. spot BTC ETFs hovered at $110 billion as of Dec. 24. This equated to over 5.7% of the Bitcoin market capitalization at the time. Cumulative net inflows stood at $35.49 billion. Israel’s nod to the funds follows rising demand across the local market.

Dogen, a new player with a price tag of just $0.0013, is turning heads. Its potential for a stunning 40,000% return is drawing attention away from well-known tokens like SHIB and PEPE. Crypto investors are intrigued by what this newcomer might bring to the table. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump’s victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign. And joining him is none other than Elon Musk, the ultimate Dogecoin (DOGE) fan who’s backed the crypto movement and even aligned with Republicans earlier this year. With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week! DOGEN will be the Next Star with 500% Surge Following the US election results, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on a steady rise: from $0.15 to $0.39 in just one week. DOGEN follows the same upward trend, starting at $0.0003 and now trading at $0.0013, a staggering 333% leap. With a total of 13 presale stages, DOGEN is set to rise to $0.0019 by the token generation event (TGE), which represents a 500% increase from its initial price. Like it DOGE style? Grab Some DOGEN Now and Watch It Soars 500% A Community-Driven Token with Referral Program The backbone of DOGEN is its strong and engaged community—an energetic group of investors ready to seize the next big opportunity. With nearly $4,000,000 already raised, DOGEN has proven its appeal among crypto enthusiasts. Adding to its allure is DOGEN’s unique multi-level referral program, which rewards community participation: 7% in USDT from direct referrals 2% from second-tier referrals 1% from third-tier referrals Wanna Surf this Bull Wave?

Live the high life you deserve: luxury cars, stacks of cash, and unforgettable experiences await those who go all-in on DOGEN. Don’t settle for ordinary when you can have it all! Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by Ryoshi, it started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s prominence. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can interact with Ethereum applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a community governance system, giving SHIB potential for broader use. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s developments and Ethereum compatibility may make it an attractive option. PEPE Coin: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network, drawing inspiration from the popular Pepe the Frog meme of the early 2000s. It seeks to replicate the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market capitalization of $1.6 billion, igniting enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts and fostering a vibrant community. The coin’s roadmap includes phases aimed at boosting visibility and adoption through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE features a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, operating as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake network. Conclusion In the current bull run of 2024, while SHIB and PEPE show less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a new meme token catering to those who seek the best in life. Inspired by tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN aims to build a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits such as exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

At this point, analysts expect BTC to mostly trade below $100,000 due to lack of liquidity during the holiday season. However, based on macroeconomic trends, analysts predict that the Bitcoin price could rise above $105,000 after Christmas. Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee said he expects Bitcoin to move within a certain range until the New Year, but argued that the price of Bitcoin could exceed $105,000 as liquidity returns after the Christmas holiday. Stating that the current downtrend in Bitcoin is a natural result of the lack of liquidity during the holiday period, the analyst explained his expectation for this week: “After Christmas, liquidity usually returns and market activity picks up again. Funds are expected to actively position in sectors that could benefit from Trump’s upcoming inauguration. At this point, the cryptocurrency sector is among the sectors that can benefit from Trump's inauguration ceremony, so the Bitcoin price will move after Christmas. The expected trading range for BTC this week is $94,000 – $105,000. The price is expected to exceed $105,000 after Christmas.” *This is not investment advice.

Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is redefining blockchain connectivity, while Avalanche’s recent upgrade slashes deployment costs and ramps up its scalability. Cardano continues to innovate, integrating Bitcoin liquidity into its DeFi ecosystem. But among these names, BlockDAG is turning heads with its unique approach, combining blockchain and DAG technology for unmatched transaction speeds and scalability. With its BDAG400 bonus and growing presale success, it’s positioning itself as a frontrunner and arguably the best crypto to buy for 2025. BlockDAG: The Future of Fast Transactions BlockDAG is making headlines with its presale success, raising over $172 million and selling more than 17.5 billion BDAG tokens. Currently priced at $0.0234 in its latest batch, BDAG has already delivered a remarkable 2240% return for early buyers. With its mainnet launch scheduled for 2025, BlockDAG aims to combine blockchain and DAG technology for unmatched scalability and speed. What’s driving attention is the BDAG400 bonus, offering up to 270% rewards across multiple tiers, including exciting mystery box bonuses for repeat buyers. This makes BlockDAG not just innovative but incredibly rewarding. Positioned as a competitor to networks like Solana and Kaspa, BlockDAG is a strong contender to be the best crypto to buy for 2025, offering long-term growth potential and robust community support. It’s a must-watch project for those looking ahead. Chainlink Price Prediction: A Reliable Bet for 2025 Chainlink’s innovative Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is rapidly expanding, now integrated with 14 blockchain networks, including the Ronin Network. This growth highlights its utility in connecting blockchain ecosystems seamlessly. With $6.5 billion in value locked in DeFi protocols and its adoption by giants like Apex Global Group for asset tokenization, Chainlink is proving its long-term potential. Analysts are optimistic, with the Chainlink price prediction pointing toward continued gains as adoption grows. For those planning ahead, Chainlink is shaping up as a solid pick and one of the best crypto to buy for 2025, blending robust tech with increasing real-world use cases. AVAX Price Outlook: A Strong Contender Avalanche recently implemented its Avalanche9000 upgrade, significantly reducing deployment costs and making it easier to launch subnets. These advancements enhance its scalability and appeal for developers building custom blockchain solutions. With the AVAX price currently hovering around $41.32, it has shown strong resilience and potential for further growth. The network's $250 million fundraising effort has boosted its ecosystem development, drawing in institutional interest and funding new initiatives. Avalanche's innovative features and growing adoption place it firmly in the spotlight as a leading blockchain platform and one of the best crypto to buy for 2025. Cardano Price 2025: A Promising Projection Cardano continues to build momentum with significant developments, including its integration with Bitcoin's OS Bridge, unlocking new liquidity for DeFi applications. Analysts are split on the Cardano price 2025, with predictions ranging from steady growth to a potential $15 surge if key upgrades succeed. Cardano's emphasis on innovation, particularly in tokenized assets and decentralized ecosystems, keeps it in the spotlight.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has revolutionized the blockchain world. It’s known for its smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). With platforms like Arbitrum and Polygon enhancing transaction efficiency, Ethereum remains at the forefront of innovation. In 2022, it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, aiming for greater scalability and energy efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase promises to reduce costs and improve performance. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers this ecosystem, playing a crucial role in transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Looking at market trends, Ethereum shows significant potential. Based on historical movements and Bitcoin’s halving cycles, some predict ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, estimates suggest a yearly low of $2,700.31. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s continuous development and commitment to decentralization make it stand out. In the current market cycle, with its evolving technology and ambitious roadmap, ETH presents an interesting opportunity for those watching the crypto space. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency scene, launched as a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum. Inspired by the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s, it embraces the fun and viral nature of internet culture. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach, it appeals to those who appreciate simplicity in the crypto world. In the spring of 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap hitting a peak of $1.6 billion. Early holders saw incredible gains, and a strong community of supporters grew around it. This rise sparked what some call a “memecoin season,” where many meme-based coins saw dramatic ups and downs. PEPE’s roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a goal of a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE will reach new heights in the current market cycle, its rapid ascent mirrors the trends of other successful meme coins, capturing the attention and hope of many in the crypto community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous “Ryoshi,” SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, granting it access to Ethereum’s vast ecosystem. Out of a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to build credibility. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, removing them from circulation. These actions boosted SHIB’s standing in the crypto world. SHIB sets itself apart with its technological capabilities. Being on Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders. In today’s market, where utility matters, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem may attract investors. Though it began as a meme, its growth and Ethereum integration could make it more appealing than other meme coins. As trends favor functionality, SHIB’s prospects look promising. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency landscape as a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform tailored for smart contracts. This innovative network empowers developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games with greater ease and efficiency. At its core is ADA, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, which stands as a formidable rival to Ethereum’s ETH. ADA enables users to store value, make payments, and engage in staking on the Cardano network, contributing to a more decentralized and secure ecosystem. What truly sets Cardano apart is its commitment to environmental sustainability. By utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, Cardano operates with significantly improved energy efficiency compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by some other cryptocurrencies. Its unique architecture divides the blockchain into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for handling transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its capability to process potentially up to a million transactions per second. Since the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, the platform has established a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. In a rapidly evolving crypto market, Cardano’s innovative technology and sustainable approach position it as a noteworthy player to watch. Conclusion ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ADA are promising, but XYZVerse stands out as a pioneering sports memecoin targeting massive growth and community-driven success this Christmas.

Accompanied by a chart, the analysis suggests that XRP might repeat its historical pattern from 2017. This assertion has sparked significant discussion within the crypto community, particularly due to its implications for potential price movements. The chart highlights specific Fibonacci levels, such as 161.80% at $8.76, 261.80% at $5.85, and 361.80% at $18.22, which align with historical patterns. Dark Defender highlighted the possible correlation between past market behavior and current retracement levels. I don't know why our Fibonacci Levels precisely align with the 2017 Historical Pattern. (NFA) Ho Ho Ho! Merry Christmas! pic.twitter.com/LPk448b3EY — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 24, 2024 This alignment draws attention to XRP’s significant performance in 2017, during which the cryptocurrency experienced a surge of over 80,000%, rising from a few cents to $3.84. Such historical data is often referenced by technical analysts to predict future trends, especially in speculative markets like cryptocurrency. Many analysts believe XRP can recreate this performance and the alignment of the Fibonacci levels adds credence to this belief. Important Targets for XRP Dark Defender’s chart emphasized the 161.80% Fibonacci level at $8.76 as a key target. If this level is reached, it would represent a substantial price increase from XRP’s current price of $2.33. Other notable levels, such as $5.85 and $18.22, are additional milestones the asset can reach on its journey. These levels are resistance levels that could become strong support levels when breached. While optimistic projections dominate the narrative, it is essential to approach such analyses with caution. Market conditions in 2024 differ significantly from those in 2017, influenced by factors like regulatory developments, global economic trends, and changes in investor sentiment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, some see this as an advantage for XRP. Some have theorized that if XRP could hit $3.84 based on speculation alone, the asset’s rising utility will help it surpass its all-time high , potentially reaching unprecedented levels. The ongoing legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also plays a crucial role in determining XRP’s price trajectory. Although Ripple’s legal victories have been well-documented, the outcome of the case could impact investor confidence, and prominent voices are confident that the new administration will dismiss the lawsuit . Analysts agree that something big is brewing for XRP and we might see a massive pump very soon. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

New Era of Altcoins The growth of other coins has been one of the big changes in the money that is digital over last few years. While Bitcoin stays the main player, making up mo͏re than 60% of total market size, other coins have slowly moved up and now show a mix of plans and uses. At first made as a choice to Bitcoin, altcoins have changed into their own system with special traits and tasks.

Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson , hailed Lace, a feature-packed native wallet, as a game-changer for the ecosystem. Lace: A New Era for Cardano Wallets Speaking on December 24, Hoskinson praised Lace’s growing popularity. He noted that its smooth transition from Nami, one of Cardano’s most-used wallets , has fueled its adoption. Nami, with over 200,000 users, has been central to Cardano’s network. Backed by Cardano’s primary developers, Input Output, Lace aims to transform how users engage with the blockchain. When Input Output acquired Nami in 2023, it laid the groundwork for innovation. The embedded mode of Lace allows users to keep the familiar Nami experience. At the same time, unlock advanced features like enhanced security, transaction bundling, and seamless governance tools. More than just a wallet, Lace serves as a gateway to Cardano. Designed for simplicity, it aims to attract millions of new users. Currently, Lace exists as a browser extension for platforms like Chrome and Brave, but a mobile app is on the horizon. This future accessibility could be the key to Cardano’s broader adoption. Balancing Innovation and Monopoly Concerns Despite its promise, not everyone in the Cardano community cheers for Lace. Some fear that Input Output’s growing control over the wallet space could stifle competition. Alessandro “Ales” Konrad, the creator of Nami, has addressed these concerns. He explained that Nami’s rapid growth exceeded his expectations. This prompted him to entrust it to Input Output for sustained innovation. While his decision reassures some, the broader community remains divided. Hoskinson Gives Glimpse into 2025 As Lace’s adoption gains momentum, Hokinson mentioned its impact on Cardano’s ecosystem could be profound. Whether it becomes the gateway to a thriving decentralized future or sparks debates over-centralization, one thing is clear. The wallet is shaping up to be one of the most influential tools in blockchain’s next chapter. Many are watching if Lace will deliver on its promise and bring Cardano closer to its ambitious goals in the coming year.

On January 1 (Wednesday), the company will unlock over $2 billion worth of tokens in three transactions of 200 million, 300 million, and 500 million XRP. Interestingly, January 2025’s unlock accounts for 1.74% of the current 57.25 billion circulating supply. Moreover, accrues for 2.63% of the remaining 38 billion XRP tokens locked in escrows under Ripple’s control. Three escrows will reach finality in the last minutes of December 31, held by two known wallet addresses Ripple owns. In particular, ‘ Ripple (24) ’ will unlock 200 and 300 million XRP, previously locked in December 2020 and January 2021. Second, ‘ Ripple (25) ’ will unlock 500 million tokens, previously locked in January 2021. These will be the last unlocks from ‘Ripple (24) and (25)’, but there are more escrows in other Ripple-controlled addresses. rw2hzLZgiQ9q62KCuaTWuFHWfiX7JWg3wY and rDqGA2GfveHypDguQ1KXrJzYymFZmKxEsF accounts. Source: XRP Scan / Finbold This is what Ripple did to the 1 billion XRP unlock in December We can look at previous monthly events as a reference to better understand what is next following this unlock. Notably, the escrow system unlocked 1 billion XRP on December 1 . Later, Ripple re-locked 800 million of the total in escrows that will end by February 2028 in two accounts. Meanwhile, the remaining 200 million was reserved at ‘ Ripple (1) ‘ for further distribution. The company then proceeded to sell the $500 million stash all at once, moving the amounts to other known and unknown accounts and selling more of the reserved XRP from ‘ Ripple (50) ‘ and Ripple (29)—all going unannounced. Interestingly, the previous month, November, marked Ripple’s largest dump in seven years, selling 470 million XRP from the 1 billion unlocked from escrows. For that, the company sent 470 million XRP to ‘Ripple (1)’. These reserved tokens were later split and sent to ‘Ripple (50)’ and rP4X2h(…) , as Finbold reported . Ripple’s XRP unlock in November 2024, by November 8. Source: Finbold So far, in 2024, Ripple has sold 3.246 billion XRP from the ‘Ripple (1)’ reserve account alone, not counting movements from other accounts – as seen occasionally from ‘Ripple (50), (29)’, and more. With XRP trading above the $2 mark, these sales represent more than $6.5 billion of selling pressure year-to-date. In comparison, the Ethereum Foundation has a yearly budget of $100 million for Ethereum (ETH) sales, which wasn’t reached. As things develop, Ripple’s aggressive strategies impose a challenge for XRP’s growth, requiring a proportional demand increase for sustainability. According to Ripple’s Q3 2024 report , the company is using an On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) model, selling at market price to willing customers, which diminishes the economic effects of gigantic potential sell walls.

The value of all coins and tokens combined recently hit an all-time high of $3.8 trillion, more than quadrupling from its bear-market low point of $823 billion in 2022. But those gains have come with significant volatility, especially in the more speculative corners of the crypto space. The famous meme coin, Dogecoin, was sitting on an incredible year-to-date return of 414% until last Wednesday, but it has plunged by 31% in the week since. The DOGE price slump has caused panic among investors, who now view DTX Exchange as a better investment option than Dogecoin. DTX’s increasing popularity, staggering presale raise, and unmatched leverage make it a lucrative opportunity in this bull run. Dogecoin Analysis: Investors Anxious About DOGE Price Dip Of 31% Dogecoin is heading into 2025 with the wind at its back, thanks to a more favorable regulatory environment and continued support from the world's richest person, Elon Musk. Therefore, should investors use the recent dip as a buying opportunity? The DOGE price decline has raised concern among investors. Elon Musk has been a big supporter of Dogecoin since 2021, when he regularly promoted it on social media and even during his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL) in May of that year. He even called it his favorite cryptocurrency. The DOGE price was trading at $0.0046 per token at the beginning of 2021, and within five months, it had soared by 15,769% to a record high of $0.73. Musk's support was a big contributor to that move, but his SNL appearance happened to mark the peak. Investors realized he didn't have a concrete plan to back up his vocal support for Dogecoin, so it wound up losing 92% of its value by mid-2022. After remaining mostly dormant in 2023 and for most of 2024, Trump's election win on Nov. 5 was the spark DOGE price needed to stage a recovery. It appears he will be a very pro-crypto president, and he recently nominated pro-crypto businessman Paul Atkins to run the SEC, pending Senate approval. Dogecoin soared to a 52-week high of $0.47 earlier this month, and it was charging toward its 2021 record of $0.73. However, it has plummeted 31% since last Wednesday because the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a new forecast pointing to fewer interest rate cuts next year. Interest rates don't affect DOGE prices directly, but a higher cost of money tends to weigh on the more speculative areas of the financial markets. It's easier to profit from borrowed funds when interest rates are low, after all. Therefore, savvy investors shift to DTX Exchange, which becomes a more enticing investment in this bull run. DTX Exchange: The Unsung Hero Grabs Attention With Presale Raise As the DOGE price trajectory remains baffling, the focus is turning more and more to DTX Exchange , a platform that’s making rapid strides as a favorite among early adopters and savvy traders alike. DTX Exchange integrates multi-asset trading, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, and forex on one platform — a far cry from traditional crypto platforms that only allow crypto trading. The hype isn’t without merit. In the current market conditions, DTX’s token has already proved to be resilient, with the results of its presale rounds delivering never-before-seen interest. Just recently, community adoption has been on the rise, showcasing massive demand in retail users. With a 1000x liquidity model and next-level trading tools, DTX is distinguishing itself from rivals, giving its users an advantage. This element makes it especially appealing to high-risk traders with little funds trying to capitalize for maximum returns. The introduction of the Phoenix Wallet, a safe custody option, along with tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), reflects DTX’s ambitious plans. These innovations will greatly transform how assets or tokens are managed and executed within the crypto environment. DTX’s user base is exploding, with over 160,000 active users and counting, and it is building a solid base for continued growth. The community’s zeal is seen in colorful discussions throughout social media platforms and on specialized forums. Now in its 6th round, the DTX presale has surpassed $10.5 million in presale raise, reflecting strong demand and investor confidence. This sign of interest is telling of a high level of faith in the project’s potential to shake up the market. Key Takeaways Dogecoin whales are rushing to DTX Exchange as DOGE price faces turbulence after a massive rally. The 31% price dip has forced the Dogecoin investors to shift to the emerging hybrid platform, which is safe from any market volatility.

The swift rally has reignited bullish sentiment as the price successfully held a critical demand level, signaling strength and positioning BTC to challenge the psychological $100,000 milestone. Market participants are now closely watching Bitcoin’s next move, anticipating continued momentum in the coming days. Related Reading: XRP Whales Keep Buying – Data Reveals Smart Money Prepares For A Rally Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a compelling technical analysis on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s formation of a symmetrical triangle on the hourly timeframe. This pattern often indicates a period of consolidation before a significant breakout, and Runefelt believes BTC is on the verge of such a move. A confirmed break above this triangle could propel Bitcoin into price discovery, unlocking further gains and marking a pivotal moment in its current market cycle. With strong demand levels providing support and technical patterns aligning for a potential breakout, Bitcoin’s path to $100,000 appears clearer than ever. However, traders remain cautious as volatility could still play a role in the short term. All eyes are on the leading cryptocurrency as it enters a critical phase, with investors eagerly awaiting confirmation of a new leg in its historic bull run. Bitcoin Looks Ready To Rally Again Bitcoin appears primed for another rally into price discovery, maintaining a bullish structure after holding critical demand levels. This resilience underscores the market’s confidence in BTC’s ability to reclaim the $100,000 mark and push higher, with both analysts and investors closely monitoring its price action for confirmation. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared an insightful technical analysis on X, highlighting a symmetrical triangle pattern on Bitcoin’s hourly chart. Symmetrical triangles often indicate a period of consolidation before a breakout, and Runefelt suggests that BTC is poised to break upward. He further identified $100,700 as a key level; surpassing it would signal strong bullish momentum, potentially driving Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Conversely, he cautioned that a drop to $95,200 would signal weakness, indicating a bearish turn in the short term. Runefelt’s analysis aligns with market sentiment, as many traders view Bitcoin’s current consolidation as a precursor to significant upward movement. If BTC confirms a breakout above the triangle, it could trigger a surge of buying activity, driving the price into uncharted territory. However, a failure to sustain momentum above critical levels may lead to heightened volatility, challenging Bitcoin’s bullish outlook.

If Bitcoin successfully breaks this resistance, it could ignite the next phase of its bull run, reaffirming its position as the dominant force in the crypto market. Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,400, marking a notable 7% surge from its recent local lows of $92,000. This recovery highlights renewed bullish momentum, with the price reclaiming the critical 4-hour 200 EMA, a key indicator of short-term strength. BTC now faces a significant hurdle as it attempts to push above the 4-hour 200 MA, which sits at $98,470. Reclaiming the 200 MA would confirm Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory, potentially igniting aggressive buying activity to propel the price above the psychological $100,000 mark. Breaking this level would not only reinforce market confidence but could also trigger further upside momentum, pushing BTC into new all-time highs.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 17:33:30

This would make its parabolic price growth mirror the coin’s past performance. Cardano (ADA) has increased its ecosystem and is now focusing on reaching a price of $10 in this market cycle. Cardano has captured massive investor confidence within the crypto sphere with its proof-of-stake mechanism and consistent development milestones. It is performing exceptionally well in the altcoin race. Although ADA is heavily dominant in the market, three alternative altcoins— Rexas Finance (RXS), Bonk, and Sei (SEI)—could see parabolic growth and deserve strong support. These tokens are significant for investors seeking to diversify due to their features, real-world applications, and growth potential. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Shift in Token Utility and Tokenization Rexas Finance has emerged as a platform accelerating business growth in tokenization. Through a singular integrated platform, it enables a wide range of asset classes to connect with blockchain technology. This platform allows physical assets such as real estate, artworks, and other illiquid investments to be tokenized via blockchain, bridging the gap to new, previously unreachable markets. The elements of its project make Rexas one of the most multi-dimensional tokens in the market. The project enables businesses to access funding on a decentralized basis through the Rexas Launchpad, building the necessary infrastructure to grow and launch startups. Its Rexas Token Builder facilitates the creation of bespoke tokens while supporting liquidity through the Rexas Treasury, ensuring sustainability over time. With state-of-the-art AI tools like Rexas GenAI for NFT promotion, the platform addresses crucial market shortcomings and enhances cross-sectoral adoption. In Rexas Finance, the welfare of tokenomics is well-devised, with a clear focus on growth and the appreciation of early-stage investors. Of the total 1 billion RXS tokens, 42.5% are designated for presale, 22.5% for staking rewards, and 15% for liquidity. Other tokens are allocated for marketing, partnerships, and the platform’s treasury. This mechanism promotes growth through long-term holding by investors. Currently, Rexas Finance is in Stage 10 of the presale, with tokens selling at $0.15. The project's popularity and investor trust are reflected in the sale of over 364 million tokens, which raised more than $30 million. By the first half of 2025, RXS is expected to list on major exchanges, increasing its rate and creating significant profit potential. Rexas Finance has launched a $1 million giveaway campaign to broaden its engagement base. Presale investors are also promised RXS tokens worth up to $50,000, adding to the project’s hype. Bonk: A Meme Coin That Has Gained Momentum Over the Years Bonk is one of the most promising meme coins within the Solana ecosystem. With a price of $0.00003745 and strong community support, It is well-positioned among mega tokens that are likely to remain for the long term. Bonk is currently retailing at fractions of a cent, appealing to high-risk, high-reward retail traders. The growing adoption and Solana’s improved network performance are likely to boost Bonk’s price in the upcoming cycle, making it a sensible addition to any portfolio. Sei (SEI): A High-Speed Blockchain Revolution Sei has disrupted the blockchain space with its high-speed and low-latency network, supporting decentralized exchanges and trading applications. Its combination of out-of-game business logic and a unique consensus mechanism has allowed Sei to prioritize ecosystem growth while maintaining scalability. Currently priced at $0.5665 with a market cap of $2.38 billion, Sei is attractive to investors aiming for significant returns. Emerging businesses worldwide continue to seek efficient and fast solutions, and enterprises like Sei stand to benefit from capturing a substantial market share. Conclusion Cardano’s evolution toward the $10 mark reflects its sound fundamentals, robust adoption, and steady progress. On the other hand, Rexas Finance (RXS), Bonk, and Sei are well-poised to deliver even better returns to investors. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with unique offerings, robust tokenomics, and a successful presale, making it the top choice among the three. The $1 million giveaway and early 2025 exchange listings are expected to drive RXS prices higher, offering extensive returns for early investors. RXS allows those who missed earlier market chances to benefit from the next significant crypto wave. Bonk and Sei add further upside potential to a solid portfolio. Together with Cardano, these tokens can help investors achieve substantial gains during the next bullish cycle, turning small-scale investments into impressive profits.

Among these is Lightchain AI (LCAI), a blockchain solution that merges artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized technology to address real-world challenges. With its cutting-edge features and ambitious roadmap, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated projects in the crypto space. Here’s why investors are keeping a close eye on this AI-driven blockchain solution. The Vision Behind Lightchain AI Lightchain AI joins the strength of smart machines with the clear and safe nature of block chain tech. This new platform i͏s made to change industries by dealing with big problems like growth, privacy and control. By breaking down AI calculations, Lightchain AI hopes to make AI development fair so all can get to better tech. Safety is also a big need, with the site using code tricks to guard soft info while allowing joint AI model learning. With uses going from health checks to supply line fixing, Lightchain AI is made to deal with real-life issues and push new ideas across many fields. The Features That Set Lightchain AI Apart What makes Lightchain AI stand out from other blockchain projects is its unique combination of technological innovations, including its groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Proof of Intelligence (PoI) The PoI consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI computations, such as training machine learning models or running inference tasks. Unlike traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI ensures that network resources contribute to advancing artificial intelligence while maintaining security and decentralization. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM is the computational layer of Lightchain AI, enabling developers to deploy AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). It supports seamless integration with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, providing a user-friendly environment for building scalable, real-time AI solutions. Lightchain AI’s Deflationary Tokenomics The LCAI token is the backbone of Lightchain AI’s ecosystem, featuring a deflationary tokenomics model designed to create long-term value for holders. A portion of transaction fees is burned over time, gradually reducing the total supply and creating scarcity. This approach fosters sustainable growth by balancing demand and availability. Additionally, the platform incentivizes participation by rewarding node operators and contributors, building an active and engaged community. LCAI tokens also serve multiple purposes within the ecosystem, including transaction fees, staking, governance participation, and access to premium features in the AIVM. Roadmap Clear Path to Adoption Lightchain AI’s roadmap showcases a thoughtful and strategic approach to growth and adoption. The journey begins with the completion of prototype development, focusing on the PoI consensus mechanism and AIVM in a sandbox environment. From there, the project will advance to the testnet rollout, inviting developers and node operators to evaluate the platform’s scalability and performance. The mainnet launch will mark the full deployment of the platform, including features such as staking, governance, and decentralized AI applications. Finally, the roadmap emphasizes ecosystem growth through partnerships, cross-chain integrations, and community-driven initiatives to drive widespread adoption. Why Investors Are Watching Lightchain AI Lightchain AI, with its innovative features and emphasis on real-world utility, is set to attract both institutional and retail investors. By combining blockchain and AI, it stands out in a market that increasingly prioritizes utility over speculation. With a presale price of just $0.003, Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity for early adopters to capitalize on significant growth as the project gains traction. Its integration of AI and blockchain addresses critical challenges in industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics, ensuring ongoing demand for the platform. Additionally, its robust tokenomics, featuring deflationary mechanisms and staking rewards, creates a self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes participation and enhances long-term value. Project to Watch Closely Lightchain AI is more than just another blockchain project—it’s a transformative solution that bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and decentralized technology. With its innovative features, strong roadmap, and focus on real-world applications, Lightchain AI is positioned to become a leading player in the crypto space. For investors seeking to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation, Lightchain AI offers a compelling opportunity to be part of a project that is reshaping industries and redefining what’s possible in the decentralized world. As Lightchain AI moves closer to its mainnet launch, its potential to disrupt markets and deliver substantial returns makes it a project worth watching closel. Keep an eye on this pioneering platform and its vision for a more transparent, secure, and equitable future powered by the synergy of AI and blockchain technology. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Crypto investors, especially newbies, need to remember that what goes up can always come down. Many inexperienced investors forget it when the markets are bullish and surging.

Popular dog meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a deep drop along with most of the crypto market.

However, the crypto has recorded gloomy trading recently, as evidenced by its seven-day and one-month performances. Despite that, a top expert has recently predicted SOL to hit $330 in the coming days, sparking optimism amid positive market trends. Here’s Why Solana Price Is Likely To Rally Ahead The crypto market has recorded a robust rally recently, especially after Donald Trump’s election win has fueled market optimism. Solana price also maintained a bullish momentum alongside other top altcoins , indicating a strong market interest in the crypto. On the other hand, the anticipation of the Solana ETF launch in the US has further bolstered market confidence. Notably, a flurry of players has filed for SOL ETF recently, indicating the growing confidence of the institutions toward the cryptocurrency. Besides, a flurry of market experts like Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has also predicted a potential ETF approval for the crypto in 2025. Meanwhile, the anticipation of a SOL rally further intensified with growing interest in the top meme coins recently. Amid this, the top Solana meme coins like FARTCOIN, BONK, POPCAT, and others, have also gained notable attention, which could further boost the crypto’s price. Simultaneously, a recent Glassnode report showed that SOL has maintained a positive net capital influx consistently since September 2023, with minor outflows noted in this period. This sustained growth indicates a positive market momentum for the crypto ahead. Source: Glassnode, X SOL To Hit $330?

Though established major players like Ripple (XRP), valued at $2.50, and Solana (SOL), priced at $218.68, a new wave of under $1 tokens is gathering steam. These tokens— Rexas Finance (RXS), Algorand (ALGO), Bonk (BONK), and The Graph (GRT)—offer accessibility and the possibility for exponential expansion, therefore positioning themselves to outperform their more expensive rivals in the next market rise. Rexas Finance (RXS): Changing Asset Management With a creative approach to tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), Rexas Finance (RXS) is transforming the financial industry. At just $0.150 in its continuous Stage 10 presale, Rexas Finance has now raised over $30.8 million with an amazing 95.98% of tokens sold. Even before its official introduction on exchanges, the project showed great investor confidence and notable demand, with the next stage price set to rise to $0.175. By being listed on CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance recently reached a milestone and improved its reputation in the crypto scene. These listings, together with its intentions to debut on three tier-one exchanges, should generate liquidity, draw institutional interest, and significantly raise the value of the coin. Rexas Finance is unique mostly in its strong ecology. While the Rexas Launchpad helps with funding for new token projects, features like the Rexas Token Builder let users tokenize their own assets. Advanced tools like Rexas GenAI, which democratizes NFT creation via AI-driven technologies, are also provided on the platform. Rexas Finance is holding a $1 million contest in which 20 winners will get $50,000 in RXS tokens each, enhancing community involvement. Together with its innovative platform, this project helps Rexas Finance stand out as a fierce competitor and outperform established players like Solana and Ripple in the upcoming market surge. Algorand (ALGO): An Environmentally Friendly, Scalable Blockchain Priced at $0.4222, Algorand (ALGO) is another interesting cryptocurrency that might outperform in the next months. Algorand has established a name as a scalable and environmentally friendly blockchain with a market valuation of $3.51 billion and a circulating supply of 8.31 billion ALGO. Both developers and companies choose it as its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus process offers speed and energy economy. Algorand is especially suited for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) thanks to its capacity to manage significant applications without sacrificing security or efficiency. A strong competitor with collaborations with worldwide companies, emphasis on carbon neutrality, and creative application in both financial and non-financial industries is its Algorand, which keeps drawing a growing user base by providing scalability and adaptability, thereby creating conditions for notable price increases. Bonk (BONK) Priced at just $0.00003713, Bonk (BONK) is the Meme Token with a Purpose that stands out among others. The token has drawn interest from speculative investors with a market capitalization of $2.81 billion and an astonishing 75.7 trillion BONK circulating supply. Unlike conventional meme tokens that depend just on hype, Bonk is progressively becoming useful with integrations with DeFi and community-driven initiatives adding value to its ecosystem. Bonk appeals to investors trying to profit from transient market swings because of its high-risk, high-reward nature. Although meme tokens are sometimes dismissed as fads, Bonk's increasing focus on utility could help it eventually compete with more ambitious, well-known initiatives. The Graph (GRT) Forms Blockchain Data's Foundation A fundamental infrastructure token found in the blockchain ecosystem is the Graph (GRT). Priced at $0.2795, with a market capitalization of $2.66 billion and a circulating supply of 9.54 billion GRT, The Graph offers a decentralized method for searching blockchain data. It is a necessary tool for developers since it drives decentralized apps (dApps) across Ethereum and other networks by allowing effective retrieval of information. The Graph benefits DeFi, NFTs, and a broad spectrum of blockchain-based apps. Its subgraph technology guarantees its relevance and acceptance in an expanding market. The Graph's subgraph technology drives demand for GRT tokens by letting developers easily create and expand projects. Under $1, the Graph is a great investment choice as the blockchain ecosystem grows, positioned for a steady increase. Why These Tokens Should Outperform These under-$1 tokens appeal because of their affordable price, solid foundations, and creative application possibilities. Rexas Finance , Algorand, Bonk, and The Graph appeal to a wider spectrum of investors because they offer notable development opportunities, unlike Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL), which already demand premium pricing. With its ambitious road map and emphasis on tokenizing actual assets—a trend altering the financial scene—Rexas Finance distinguishes itself. Algorand is a sustainable choice for companies and developers because of its environmental focus and scalability. While The Graph's function as the ""Google of blockchain data"" highlights its long-term promise, Bonk's meme-token roots are matched by its expanding usefulness. Conclusion Under $1 tokens include Rexas Finance, Algorand, Bonk, and The Graph, leading the next wave of expansion as the cryptocurrency market develops. For investors looking for large profits, their affordability and creative platforms and ecosystems appeal as investment prospects. Although well-known companies like Solana and Ripple stick to their ways, these low-cost options present exponential potential and should be watched in the next market rise.

While the transactions aren’t much of a panic selling, the whale’s behaviour adds to similar sell-offs seen in the past month. A number of large wallets have dumped ETH as the altcoin struggled to break higher. With BTC price retreating from its all-time high above $108k, Ethereum dropped to below $3,200. The gains to nearly $4,000 earlier provided a profit-taking opportunity. Some addresses took the cash, contributing to the decline and struggle engulfing bulls. Other than Nexo, which has been active in recent days, some notable sellers have included the Ethereum Foundation. Justin Sun, Tron’s founder, has also been aggressive. Despite the offloading, ETH’s price remains resilient, above $3k. It hovered around $3,448 at the time of writing – about 1.2% down in the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, capital is flowing into emerging projects like Chainlink (LINK) and DTX Exchange (DTX), both of which are gaining momentum with their innovative features and promising returns. Let’s dive deeper into what’s driving these trends. Ripple at a Crossroads: Will $2 Support Hold, or Is a Bigger Dip Coming? There has been a lot of volatility in XRP's price trend over the last month. The coin fluctuated in a somewhat limited range due to regulatory barriers and shifting market sentiment; it most recently traded around $0.60 after falling from a peak of $0.80. However, seasoned investors claim that this is nothing new. Sarah Greene, a crypto expert, states, ""We've seen it before."" After extended periods of consolidation and negative momentum, XRP frequently recovers quickly. ""The way this pattern looks mirrors the setup on the run that we saw in late 2021."" This week marks the fourth anniversary of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs, co-founder Chris Larsen, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The legal dispute has had a major impact on XRP and its investors since December 2020, changing the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Currently, Ripple (XRP) is trading at $2.23, experiencing a dip of over 17% in the past week. XRP’s price is nearing its crucial price support of $2, which, if Ripple (XRP) fails to hold, then investors can expect a larger dip to $1 or below. Due to their long-ongoing battle with the SEC and prolonged bearish sentiment around the project, Ripple (XRP), investors have started to rotate their capital to more innovative and profitable projects. These projects include Chainlink (LINK) and DTX Exchange (DTX). LINK Gains Momentum: 16 New Integrations Driving Demand Chainlink (LINK), a blockchain abstraction layer, makes it possible for smart contracts to connect with external data—a crucial feature for intricate digital contracts. Chainlink's significance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem is cemented by the fact that its decentralized oracle network underpins a number of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. With 16 new integrations across 11 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, recent adoption updates highlight Chainlink's expanding impact. These collaborations boost its capabilities and reach, which might lead to a rise in demand for its Oracle services. The price of LINK increased by 3.43% on the last day, which is in line with this network activity and indicates that even in a weak market, investor interest is high. With a volume-to-market cap ratio of 0.1089, Chainlink's liquidity is still strong, guaranteeing investors may trade with ease. It has maintained good momentum, as seen by its 53% green days during the past month. Chainlink may appeal to investors looking for a balance of innovation and consistent performance. Transforming Trading Forever: Why DTX Exchange Is the Project to Watch As capital rotates from Ripple (XRP), another altcoin is seeing a major surge in demand - DTX Exchange (DTX) . DTX is the crypto world’s first unified exchange, which will offer stocks, cryptos, ETFs, and forex all under the same roof. It will save you from the hassle of managing multiple platforms for different asset classes. This feature of managing multiple assets in a single place is enabled by its VulcanX blockchain. This blockchain is made to interact with conventional assets like stocks and forex. With an anticipated TPS of more than 100,000, the blockchain has already started the testnet. DTX exchange introduced its token to the public through its presale, which launched at $0.01 per DTX token. Now, it stands at a $0.12 price point, translating a price jump of over 500%. This sharp price hike is attributed to the innovative features that DTX Exchange is offering. These include over 1000x liquidity model, phoenix wallet introduction, community-driven growth, listing on well-known platforms, and a lot more. Early investors of the DTX Exchange (DTX) presale have already enjoyed over 440% ROI over the past few months and are now all set to enjoy additional 80% gains in the subsequent presale rounds till the official listing. The presale has already collected over $10.5M and is now nearing its conclusion.

Table of Contents FXGuys: The high-potential altcoin with real utility Staking FXG for passive income and revenue share FXGuys’ trader funding program: The path to up to $500,000 in capital No KYC, no buy/sell tax: Decentralized and accessible trading Why traders are calling FXGuys the ‘next Solana’ Conclusion The cryptocurrency world has seen its fair share of successful altcoins, but one project is rapidly standing out in the crowded space, FXGuys . Traders are buzzing about FXGuys as the ‘Next Solana’, and there are several reasons why this altcoin could be the one to watch. With its approach to decentralized trading, unique Trader Funding Program, and exciting staking rewards, FX Guys has already raised over $2.6 million in its Stage 2 presale, and the hype surrounding it only continues to grow. This article will explore what makes FXGuys a high-potential altcoin, what’s driving the buzz, and why it could be the next big thing in the crypto market. FXGuys: The high-potential altcoin with real utility FXGuys is gaining attention mainly because of its practical utility and smart approach. Unlike many altcoins that rely on speculation or hype alone, FX Guys has been designed with real-world applications in mind. As a Top PropFi Project, FXGuys blends the best aspects of DeFi with a proprietary trading firm model, allowing users to invest in the token and actively engage in profitable trading. One of the key selling points of FXGuys is its Trade2Earn program. This feature rewards users with FXG tokens every time they trade, helping to boost trading activity and liquidity. This built-in incentive structure helps grow the platform’s ecosystem while ensuring participants are continually rewarded for their engagement. Staking FXG for passive income and revenue share FXGuys goes beyond just a simple trading platform, it’s an ecosystem that rewards long-term participation. By staking the FXG token, users gain access to a 20% profit and revenue share from broker trading volume. This staking feature creates an attractive opportunity for investors and traders to earn passive income on top of their trading activities. For those looking to maximize their returns, this staking model provides a clear incentive to hold FXG tokens rather than selling them off immediately. The combination of staking rewards and the opportunity to earn a share of trading profits positions the FXguys as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in the market. FXGuys’ trader funding program: The path to up to $500,000 in capital Another key feature that sets FX Guys apart is its Trader Funding Program . This program allows talented retail traders to access funded accounts with up to $500,000 in trading capital after passing a series of evaluations and challenges. Once funded, traders keep 80% of the profits, a generous profit split that makes FXGuys one of the most attractive proprietary trading firms in the crypto space. This program provides traders with a way to scale their trading activities without having to risk their capital. For those who have the skill but lack the capital to trade at a larger scale, FX Guys offers a platform where they can grow their profits while minimizing personal risk. This unique offering has earned FXGuys a reputation as a smart prop trader platform, and it’s one of the driving factors behind the project’s growing buzz. Interested investors can join FXGUYS here.

Here is a Compilation of Predictions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-much-did-famous-names-predictions-for-bitcoin-price-in-2024-do-here-is-a-compilation-of-predictions/,"As 2025 approaches, the cryptocurrency world is once again awash with bold predictions about the future of Bitcoin. So, industry giants like Cathie Wood, Mike Novogratz, and Michael Saylor have frequently made headlines with their predictions, but how well did their 2024 predictions come true? Here's a look at some of the top predictions and how they performed against reality. While crypto executives are rarely pessimistic, some have taken a more cautious stance on Bitcoin’s 2024 trajectory. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and head of the Maelstrom Fund, predicted in late 2023 that Bitcoin would climb to around $70,000 by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, VanEck and analysts at Bitwise have predicted that Bitcoin will reach new all-time highs without committing to exact figures. By the fourth quarter of 2024, Bitcoin had indeed surpassed previous highs, breaking through the $100,000 mark for the first time. While Hayes downplayed the bull run, his broader outlook remained optimistic, with predictions that Bitcoin could reach $750,000 to $1 million by 2026. Others were more ambitious and less accurate. Tim Draper, known for his relentless bullishness, has long been a proponent of Bitcoin’s potential to explode. In 2018, he claimed that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by 2022. When that didn’t happen, he extended the timeline to 2023, then 2024, citing the momentum from the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs as a major driver. By November, Draper revised his forecast again, predicting $120,000 by December 2024. Similarly, analysts at Matrixport and Standard Chartered have also changed their forecasts throughout the year. Both had predicted a Bitcoin price of $125,000, but ended up settling for a more modest result. Related News: Whales Show Suspicious Activity in This Altcoin: Fresh Whales Bought $34 Million in the Last Five Days Among the boldest forecasters, Cathie Wood, Mike Novogratz, and Michael Saylor stood out. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, once claimed that Bitcoin would reach $500,000 by 2024. However, as the year progressed, he scaled back his expectations and eventually predicted $100,000, which came pretty close to the actual figure. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, a firm with a history of aggressive Bitcoin investments, has maintained its forecasts of $500,000 by 2026 and $1 million by 2030. While those long-term targets remain under test, ARK’s short-term outlook has been less emphasized. Then there’s Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy and the face of Bitcoin maximalism. Saylor’s eye-popping prediction of $13 million per Bitcoin by 2045 remains one of the boldest statements in the space. But for 2024, he remained focused on accumulation rather than specific price points. The guessing game continues as the industry’s biggest names look to 2025 and beyond. VanEck sees more records on the horizon, while analysts like Noelle Acheson predict Bitcoin will surpass $125,000 next year. *This is not investment advice.

Recent burn data indicated that millions of coins were taken out of the token’s circulating supply, sparking noteworthy optimism surrounding the crypto amid recent ecosystem developments. Notably, market watchers are eyeing remarkable gains in the meme coin’s price ahead, primarily in the wake of recent community advancements despite broader volatility. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars 100% Reverberating Market Optimism As per the recent data from Shibburn as of December 25, the Shiba Inu burn rate witnessed a roughly 97% uptick, underlining a massive blow to the token’s circulating supply. Per the data, a whopping 6.26 million SHIB were sent to a null address, indicating that these tokens had been permanently removed from the circulating supply. Altogether, the burn rate surge glimmered hope for the asset’s future price movements, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, the SHIB token burn mechanism focuses on reducing the dog-themed meme coin’s market supply, which many believe to be the reason for the asset’s sluggish performance over the years. In addition, other optimistic ecosystem developments have also poured investor optimism into the crypto’s future movements. A recent CoinGape Media report revealed that the Shiba Inu community witnessed the ‘SHIB: The Metaverse’ launch this Christmas, enhancing the coin’s market visibility. Renowned community member KaalDhairya took to X, spotlighting the launch and garnering notable attention. Per Kaal, the platform has officially launched this Christmas, boasting jaw-dropping visuals that attract market participants. Also, the new platform uses Chainlink CCIP, pioneering a big step toward ‘multi-chain greatness for SHIB.’ Whilst the abovementioned endeavor marked a monumental stride, the looming launch of the TREAT token also weighed in, bringing additional investor optimism. SHIB lead developer Shyoshi Kusama recently hinted that ‘TREATS for the meme coin’s community are to arrive soon,’ sparking bullish market discussions. Overall, the aforementioned developments reverberated substantial optimism for the meme crypto’s future price movements despite a volatile market. SHIB To Pump Hard Ahead? Despite soaring optimism amid the mentioned developments, SHIB price witnessed heightened volatility intraday and is resting at $0.00002293. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.00002261 and $0.00002402, respectively. Notably, the top meme coin’s turbulent action aligns with the broader market’s volatile state. Nevertheless, long-term prospects for the token shine with bullishness. Reportedly, SHIB price eyes a major rally ahead in the wake of its lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, highlighting community developments. The token eyes a rebound to $0.000026 or even $0.000029 ahead, further supported by the Shiba Inu burn rate upswing and strong SHIB on-chain dynamics . Meanwhile, recent Whale Alert data flagged a whopping 2.88 trillion SHIB accumulation, worth $65.70 million, from the Turkish crypto exchange BTCTurk. Overall, crypto market participants continue to eye the coin extensively, expecting bullish shifts amid the aforementioned market statistics that indicate a strong potential to rally against the backdrop of supple decline and increased buying.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous ""Ryoshi,"" SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, granting it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem. Out of a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to build credibility. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, removing them from circulation. These actions boosted SHIB's standing in the crypto world. SHIB sets itself apart with its technological capabilities. Being on Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders. In today's market, where utility matters, SHIB's expanding ecosystem may attract investors. Though it began as a meme, its growth and Ethereum integration could make it more appealing than other meme coins. As trends favor functionality, SHIB's prospects look promising. Conclusion While SHIB remains strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the first all-sport memecoin uniting fans, poised for significant growth during the 2024 bull run.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has revolutionized the blockchain world. It's known for its smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). With platforms like Arbitrum and Polygon enhancing transaction efficiency, Ethereum remains at the forefront of innovation. In 2022, it transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, aiming for greater scalability and energy efficiency. The upcoming sharding phase promises to reduce costs and improve performance. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers this ecosystem, playing a crucial role in transactions and rewarding those who support the network. Looking at market trends, Ethereum shows significant potential. Based on historical movements and Bitcoin's halving cycles, some predict ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, estimates suggest a yearly low of $2,700.31. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum's continuous development and commitment to decentralization make it stand out. In the current market cycle, with its evolving technology and ambitious roadmap, ETH presents an interesting opportunity for those watching the crypto space. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a new player in the cryptocurrency scene, launched as a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum. Inspired by the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s, it embraces the fun and viral nature of internet culture. PEPE aims to join the ranks of famous meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a straightforward approach, it appeals to those who appreciate simplicity in the crypto world. In the spring of 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap hitting a peak of $1.6 billion. Early holders saw incredible gains, and a strong community of supporters grew around it. This rise sparked what some call a ""memecoin season,"" where many meme-based coins saw dramatic ups and downs. PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a goal of a ""meme takeover."" While it's uncertain if PEPE will reach new heights in the current market cycle, its rapid ascent mirrors the trends of other successful meme coins, capturing the attention and hope of many in the crypto community. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin, inspired by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous ""Ryoshi,"" SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, granting it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem. Out of a quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to build credibility. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, removing them from circulation. These actions boosted SHIB's standing in the crypto world. SHIB sets itself apart with its technological capabilities. Being on Ethereum allows it to support projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Future plans include an NFT platform and a governance system for holders. In today's market, where utility matters, SHIB's expanding ecosystem may attract investors. Though it began as a meme, its growth and Ethereum integration could make it more appealing than other meme coins. As trends favor functionality, SHIB's prospects look promising. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency landscape as a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform tailored for smart contracts. This innovative network empowers developers to create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games with greater ease and efficiency. At its core is ADA, Cardano's native cryptocurrency, which stands as a formidable rival to Ethereum's ETH. ADA enables users to store value, make payments, and engage in staking on the Cardano network, contributing to a more decentralized and secure ecosystem. What truly sets Cardano apart is its commitment to environmental sustainability. By utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, Cardano operates with significantly improved energy efficiency compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by some other cryptocurrencies. Its unique architecture divides the blockchain into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for handling transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its capability to process potentially up to a million transactions per second. Since the introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021, the platform has established a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. In a rapidly evolving crypto market, Cardano's innovative technology and sustainable approach position it as a noteworthy player to watch. Conclusion ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ADA are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher, blending meme culture and sports in a community-driven platform targeting 20,000% growth this bull run.

These platforms offer advantages like seamless deposits and withdrawals in digital assets and registration access from almost any region worldwide. However, when selecting a bitcoin casino, it's essential to weigh the platform’s features against your needs while keeping in mind the inherent risks of gambling. Here are the top 7 best bitcoin gambling sites to explore in 2025, each bringing unique strengths to the table. 1. Dexsport.io Dexsport is a standout name in the bitcoin gambling niche, seamlessly combining a no KYC casino with a robust betting platform. Users can deposit and withdraw funds using over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and even meme coins. The platform actively expands its range of supported digital assets. The registration process is quick and entirely anonymous, requiring no personal data.

With its hassle-free onboarding, a reputation for reliability, and a privacy-first approach, Dexsport has solidified its position as a leader in the GambleFi space. This combination of convenience and high standards of gambling security makes it a preferred choice for crypto gamblers. 2. BC.GAME BC.GAME is another crypto-friendly casino offering a range of features, including sports betting, gambling games, futures trading, and instant lotteries. While the platform’s design might feel a bit outdated, it boasts localization in 29 languages and supports over 50 cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and USDT. One drawback is occasional delays and issues with withdrawals reported by users. According to Trustpilot reviews, customer support sometimes struggles to resolve these cases promptly. 3. BetFury BetFury shines with its extensive list of 56 supported coins across 16 blockchains. Combining an online Bitcoin sportsbook with a gambling platform, BetFury also offers futures trading and crypto loans. A notable convenience is the ability to purchase cryptocurrency directly via bank cards on the platform. However, BetFury has regional restrictions in some EU countries and the U.S., and selective KYC may be required for withdrawals. 4. Sportsbet.io Sportsbet.io has established itself as a reputable crypto-friendly bookmaker, often collaborating with sports teams like Newcastle United and Hull City, as well as Spain's La Liga. The platform greatly focuses on sports betting, offering an extensive range of events, including esports.

Despite these concerns, Stake remains a strong competitor in the crypto gambling market. 6. Rollbit Rollbit offers a mix of gambling games and financial tools, including crypto loans. Popular features include slots, roulette, challenges, and exclusive Rollbit Originals games. While Rollbit provides various entertainment options, it cannot be considered an anonymous online casino, as it requires KYC for registration and sometimes for withdrawals. Trustpilot reviews highlight occasional user frustrations regarding these policies. 7. Bets.io Bets.io is the final entry in today's list, supporting deposits and withdrawals for over 10 popular cryptocurrencies. Like many of its peers, Bets.io offers sportsbook lines for various sports events and access to gambling games, including a selection of exclusive titles available only on this platform. Another convenient feature is the ability to purchase cryptocurrency directly on-site. However, potential drawbacks include the need to provide personal information to withdraw winnings and the lack of registration options via DeFi wallets, which may deter privacy-focused users. Conclusion Selecting the [best bitcoin gambling site] depends on your specific preferences, such as anonymity, supported cryptocurrencies, or access to unique games. While all platforms in this list excel in crypto-friendliness, it’s crucial to stay informed about each platform’s features, user reviews, and potential drawbacks to make an informed choice.

This comes amidst improved crypto regulatory framework across many major jurisdictions, including Europe. It is Noteworthy that the Middle Eastern country was inspired by this positive global sentiment and refused to be left behind by its counterparts. By February 25, 2025, Turkey’s new regulatory framework will become effective. Turkey to Combat Laundering of Illicit Funds Following the introduction of the crypto regulatory framework, any transaction above 15,000 Turkish liras, which is approximately $425, is expected to be properly reported. Users executing such transactions must share their identifying information with Turkey’s crypto service providers. They are not under any obligation to report details of digital asset transfers below the $425 threshold. By implementing this new Anti Money Laundering (AML) rule, Turkey intends to reduce the occurrence of risky transactions involving cryptocurrencies. This includes the incident of crypto scams, laundering of illicit funds as well as terrorism financing, as reported in the document issued by the Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey, EU to Implement MiCA by December 30 There is a general rise in the global demand for cryptocurrencies and crypto-related solutions. Consequently, many jurisdictions are putting measures to ensure the sector does not go out of hand. In about five days, the European Union (EU) will welcome the much-anticipated world’s first comprehensive crypto regulatory framework dubbed the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill. Like the new Turkish digital asset regulation, MiCA is focused on combating illicit activities like money laundering. A few experts think the bill may kick Europe out of a potential incoming crypto boom , but the region remains undisturbed. Rather, it is preparing to implement the bill that requires all stablecoins to be issued by entities with an e-money license. US Crypto Regulation Landscape to Take a Different Turn On the other hand, the United States is taking a different approach to cryptocurrencies. With Republican politician Donald Trump coming into office by January, the crypto landscape in the region is expected to change. He even plans to dethrone Gary Gensler as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman. Trump has already nominated Paul Atkins as the replacement for Gensler. Trump has promised to establish a dedicated crypto advisory council, and many crypto leaders are pushing to get a seat.

However, emerging projects like Lightchain AI Presale are proving that small investments can lead to big rewards. For those who missed out on the early days of top-tier coins, these low-cost assets provide a second chance to turn modest investments into significant profits. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Leveraging AI for Exponential Growth What It Offers Lightchain AI (LCAI) stands out by merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, enabling developers to build AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps). At a presale price of just $0.003, LCAI provides unprecedented upside potential. Key Features Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) A dedicated layer crafted for AI-specific tasks like model training and inference, seamlessly integrated into the blockchain. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) A groundbreaking consensus mechanism that doesn’t just secure the network but also rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. Scalability That Delivers With advanced features like sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Lightchain AI ensures high-speed, high-throughput AI tasks without breaking a sweat. Unmatched Privacy & Security In a world where data is king, Lightchain AI takes privacy and security to the next level Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) Keep sensitive data fully protected during computations, building trust for both developers and users. Homomorphic Encryption Perform computations on encrypted data without ever exposing it—ensuring your data stays confidential every step of the way. Growth Prospects If LCAI’s technology and roadmap milestones are realized, early adopters who buy in at $0.003 could see dramatic returns—potentially turning a few hundred dollars into substantial wealth. Manta Network (MANTA) Privacy Solutions for DeFi With privacy becoming a big worry in DeFi, Manta Network gives safe deals and keeps users hidden on the chain, which helps small investors join DeFi too with its trade cost under a dollar. MANTA’s aim on privacy is really nice, using zero-know proofs to keep user info and trade plans secret. With DeFi use still getting bigger the need for privacy-based answers seems to grow, putting MANTA as a main part in this key market spot. By focusing on privacy, MANTA can pull in both shops and big money players, raising need and maybe giving great profits to first back͏ers. Casper (CSPR) Enterprise-Grade Blockchain for Future Growth Casper (CSPR) offers an enterprise-friendly blockchain that is upgradeable, scalable, and energy-efficient, making it an appealing choice for companies seeking secure, professional-grade blockchain solutions. Often priced well under $1, Casper’s foundational technology positions it as a strong contender in the blockchain market. As businesses increasingly explore blockchain integration, Casper’s reliable infrastructure could emerge as a go-to platform, boosting token utility and value. Its methodical approach and focus on sustainability may also provide more predictable growth, attracting investors with a moderate risk appetite. While Casper might not deliver overnight riches, its steady trajectory and enterprise focus could lead to impressive long-term returns for patient early investors. Memecoin Contenders Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) may not be known for cutting-edge technology, but they boast devoted communities and a strong social media presence. With low prices, they serve as accessible entry points into the crypto world. These memecoins remain relevant thanks to the power of their communities, driven by viral marketing, celebrity endorsements, and a sense of fun that fuels occasional price surges. Their affordability and widespread name recognition make them particularly appealing to new crypto investors, ensuring both liquidity and ongoing interest. While they offer less utility compared to projects like LCAI or MANTA, memecoins can still deliver significant short-term gains during market hype cycles, though they come with higher volatility and unpredictability.

Reuters reports that the Russian government has recently taken legislative measures to legalize the mining of the crypto king and other crypto assets, helping firms find ways around sanctions placed on them by the West. As stated by Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov to Reuters earlier this week, “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the US government was undermining the use of the US dollar as a reserve currency, forcing nations to turn to other assets. At the time, Putin cited Bitcoin as the top replacement for the US dollar as a reserve asset, noting that no nation could regulate it. However, earlier this week, the Russian government reportedly said it’s planning on shutting down Bitcoin mining in 10 different regions throughout the nation starting on January 1, 2025 due to energy shortages. The prohibition period affects both miners of mining pools and is expected to remain in effect until March 5th, 2031. BTC is trading for $98,505 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

The court unanimously rejected Kwon's appeal, citing unresolved legal issues, according to Montenegro's Vijesti newspaper. The rejection clears the way for Montenegro's justice minister to decide whether Kwon should be extradited to South Korea or the United States. While both South Korea and the US are seeking Kwon's extradition, the justice department's current stance suggests he is more likely to face trial in the US.

Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 while trying to travel with a fake passport. He has since faced increasing legal challenges as authorities from both his home country of South Korea and the United States fight his extradition.

By introducing groundbreaking technologies, Lightchain AI has become the leading provider of AI-powered solutions for blockchain networks and decentralized applications. Designed for adaptability and real-world utility, Lightchain AI sets a new benchmark, empowering developers and users with transformative, AI-driven solutions for a decentralized future. Priced at $0.003 during its presale , Lightchain AI offers affordable and accessible solutions for businesses. Understand the Traditional Blockchain Challenges Old blockchain ways have big problems that hold back their ability for real-time, large use cases. One big problem is growth since usual blockchains have a hard time handling lots of transactions and tough jobs at the same time. This causes slowdowns, more delays, and greater costs. Privacy and data power make a big problem. Central systems often need private info, which makes people worry about safety ͏breaks and wrong use. Likewise, unfairness and trust are worries in AI-led systems, where central control cuts down fairness and inclusion. At last, old block chains miss clear sight and trust in choices, which gets worse due to the slow way of asking for agreement like Proof of Work. Fixing these problems is key to opening up block chain's real strength in many fields. How Lightchain AI Transforming Blockchain With AI Lightchain AI is revolutionizing blockchain technology by integrating advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into its decentralized framework. At its core, Lightchain introduces two groundbreaking innovations—Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM)—to address challenges like scalability, transparency, and inclusivity in both AI and blockchain ecosystems. PoI is a novel consensus mechanism that incentivizes nodes to perform meaningful AI tasks, such as model training and optimization, ensuring network security while advancing decentralized AI capabilities. Unlike traditional Proof of Work or Proof of Stake systems, PoI aligns blockchain operations with real-world AI applications, promoting sustainability and equitable participation. The AIVM is a specialized computational layer that seamlessly executes AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, supporting real-time applications and interoperability with popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Its design ensures privacy, scalability, and efficient resource utilization, making decentralized AI development accessible and secure. By leveraging decentralized governance, Lightchain ensures community-driven decision-making, reducing biases and fostering accountability. The platform’s innovative approach bridges the gap between AI’s computational power and blockchain’s transparency, paving the way for scalable, privacy-preserving, and equitable decentralized solutions that redefine the future of technology. Redefining Tokenomics and Scalability with Advanced AI Solutions Lightchain AI is revolutionizing tokenomics and scalability through its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. The platform’s Lightchain Token (LCAI) serves as the foundation of a robust ecosystem, enabling seamless AI services while promoting long-term sustainability. The Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism drives equitable token distribution by rewarding nodes for meaningful AI computations like model training and optimization. This ensures fair participation across a diverse network of contributors, enhancing scalability without compromising inclusivity. Additionally, dynamic tokenomics, such as adaptive rewards, token-burning mechanisms, and sustainable inflation control, ensure ecosystem growth and value retention. To address the computational demands of AI workloads, Lightchain employs advanced scalability techniques, including sharding, Layer 2 rollups, and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). These innovations support high throughput and low latency, enabling the network to handle large-scale transactions and intensive AI tasks efficiently. By combining advanced tokenomics and scalable AI-driven solutions, Lightchain AI creates a future-ready ecosystem for decentralized intelligence and innovation. How to Get Involve If you’re eager to join Lightchain AI’s innovative platform, there are multiple ways to get involved. For investors, the ongoing presale offers a chance to buy tokens at a discounted rate before their potential future growth. Keeping track of Lightchain AI’s roadmap and key milestones can also help you decide when to invest or expand your investment. Developers have the opportunity to contribute by either joining the Lightchain AI team or creating decentralized applications on the platform once it goes live. With its commitment to practical solutions and community-driven progress, Lightchain AI is an exciting project for developers looking to lead in the blockchain space. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 19:23:00

Conflux price forecast 2026 The team has prepared 2.4 billion CFX tokens as grant awards to encourage developers to broaden its network.

By the end of 2024, the CFX price might record a minimum of $0.2780. The price may peak at $0.3427, with the average trading price anticipated around $0.2893. However, the future market potential for Conflux entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation in China, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect the CFX price to reach as high as $0.65 by the end of 2027. Conflux historic price sentiment CFX price history Conflux launched at approximately $0.08 in late 2020, reaching an all-time high of $1.70 on March 27, 2021, during a crypto bull run.

The protocol also noted that this asset bridging can be done securely. The Sonic Chain Bridge Features This new bridge comes following the mainnet launch of the protocol on December 18. As part of the update, Sonic Labs said the new gateway has passed audits from three major security firms. These include Open Zeppelin, Quantstamp and Certora Inc. Despite the safety of the bridge, it has confirmed ongoing working plans with ImmuneFi for a bug bounty program. Notably, it has designated a total of $2 million for the bounties, an offering it will split between the Gateway and Sonic Chain. Now, holders of FTM on the Ethereum network can now upgrade to S through the Gateway. For users’ safety, the protocol released the contract addresses of USDC, EURC, and WETH on Sonic. We’re working with the global developer community to fortify the Gateway’s security through bug bounties on @ImmuneFi . $2 million in bounties is on offer, split across the Gateway and the Sonic chain — more details to come. pic.twitter.com/gvBxtDqpYo — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) December 25, 2024 Launched earlier in January, the Sonic Chain crossed the 1 million block milestone as reported by Coingape. This proves the fast rate of adoption of the new chain amid confirmation over 1,600 Transactions Per Second (TPS).

Despite the new all-time highs for Bitcoin (BTC), the shares of most mining entities are on track to end the year in the red. Not all publicly traded mining companies are sharing in the success of MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, or Hut8. The stocks of most mining entities are on track to end the year in the red. The stock market performance of mining companies shows deep losses for the year to date, based on data collection by Hashrate Index. A total of 17 companies out of 25 publicly traded miners were in the red as of December 25, though some still have a chance to turn the trend by the end of the year. MicroStrategy (MSTR) remains the exception, starting the year at $68 and rallying to a peak of $473.83 in November. As of December 25, MSTR traded at $358.18, though its price performance depended on its ongoing buying of more BTC. Mining companies try to diversify into new data-based tasks Argo Blockchain Plc had the deepest losses, erasing 82.92% of its share price, down to $0.0615. The miner has not taken track of building up a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury and only has three coins in its reserves. Argo is a hosted mining company, a new model that relies on renting out electricity, rack, and cooling access, as well as delivering and installing ASIC on behalf of users. One of the biggest winners for 2024 is also a hosted mining company – Bitdeer Technologies Group. BTDR shares are up by 165.32%, trading at $23.56. BTDR holds 443 BTC, a small treasury from mining and not from acquisitions. As a contrast, Hut8 shares expanded by 92.7% in the year to date, trading at $24.28, slightly down from their peak of over $29. Hut8 also expanded its BTC acquisitions with debt financing. The other winner was Iris Energy Ltd, which shifted to investments in data centers. TeraWulf is another winner with 170.87% growth, based on its previous commitment to expand to AI data centers. WULF shares traded at $6.23, near their highest level for the past six months. WULF also got a boost from its attempt at carbon-neutral mining. For most miners, production prices vary and some are weighed down by costs. For others, the current BTC prices are favorable for realizing profits and financing future projects. Miners retain 1.9M BTC, down from over 2.02M in August 2024. Mining as a whole is not always a good proxy for the performance of BTC, and mining companies are facing different pressures. While individual shares were volatile, the overall HI Crypto Mining Stock Index retained relatively high levels in 2024. The index ended the year at 5,330.37 points, up from 4,234.18 points in January. The HI Crypto Mining Index posted net growth in 2024, though slowing down at the end of the year. | Source: Solactive The index includes chip producers and mining-related companies and has been rising for both 2023 and 2024, recovering after its 2021 and 2022 crashes. The index also includes the most prominent mining companies, though the selection may differ from the selection of Hashrate Index. BTC mining activity remains at peak levels BTC mining activity is showing no signs of slowing down or capitulation. Mining companies are using some of their proceeds to acquire new ASIC while retaining their previous contracts for energy access. The BTC hashrate is at over 770 EH/s, near all-time highs. Miners also produce blocks at the absolute highest difficulty, with constant growth over the past year. Individual miners, farms, companies, and even governments are also trying to mine with the most competitive pools. At the end of 2024, Foundry USA is the biggest pool, controlling over 31% of the total hashrate. Foundry is the choice for most mining companies that produce coins for their own reserves. The closest competitors Antpool and ViaBTC make up another 30% of mining. Binance Pool remains competitive but shuts down capacity during unfavorable conditions.

According to current data, BGB is trading for $5.64 at time of writing, a 15% increase during the last 24 hours. BGB launched in 2021 and was designed to boost community engagement and streamline trading activities within the Bitget ecosystem. According to a recent report by Bitget, the exchange surged in popularity, partially due to a rise in Gen Z crypto buyers, who began gobbling up digital assets after former President Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. The data shows that Bitget saw a staggering 683% increase in Gen Z users in November, pushing the demographics’ share of new users on the platform from 26.2% in October to 53.8% by the end of November. “Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric during his campaign, including pledges to establish a national Bitcoin reserve and encourage domestic Bitcoin mining, resonated with younger voters. This demographic, known for its tech-savviness and interest in financial autonomy, responded by flocking to platforms like Bitget. In total, 844,000 new users under 25 joined Bitget in November, a dramatic rise from the 110,000 recorded in October. The shift highlights the influence of political narratives on financial behavior, with market enthusiasm fueled by the fear of missing out (FOMO) and expectations of favorable crypto policies under the new administration.” Bitget’s research reports that Gen Z users now make up about 21% of all crypto investors.

In a social media post, Adam, an analyst at Greeks.live, noted a notable change in the options market, noting that the spread between various maturities has increased. Adam explained that during the bull market at the end of the year, option spreads across maturities remained fairly close, with fluctuations around 5% and spreads typically no more than 1%. This stability reflected consistent optimism among market participants. Related News: How Much Did Famous Names' Predictions for Bitcoin Price in 2024 Do? Here is a Compilation of Predictions However, recent regulations have reversed this trend: The gap between distortions for different maturities has started to widen significantly. The short-term skew has fallen significantly, indicating that enthusiasm among market participants has clearly diminished. According to the analyst firm, the data shows that enthusiasm in the broader market has waned significantly, especially among options traders. Optimism for January, a critical period for market activity, has waned, suggesting a shift in sentiment after the euphoria of the last bull market. *This is not investment advice.

According to a recent report, over 30% of its population is now engaged in crypto investments. As of November 2024, the number of crypto investors soared to 15.59 million. Analysts revealed that South Korea’s crypto market has hit an incredible value of 102.6 trillion won, equivalent to $78 billion. This is driven by economic optimism and booming global blockchain trends. South Korea Explosive Crypto Growth Multiple factors drive the surge in South Korea’s crypto investments. This includes a combination of market sentiment and global political changes. One key event that significantly influenced this shift was Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Following his win, investor optimism soared, particularly in sectors like digital assets. This surge in confidence led South Korean investors to diversify their portfolios increasingly. Many turned to digital currencies to safeguard or grow their wealth. Between July and November 2024, South Korea’s crypto market experienced a dramatic increase in value. The total market capitalization nearly doubled, rising from 58 trillion won, about $44 billion, to a whopping 102.6 trillion won, equivalent to almost $78 billion. South Korean investors now hold an average of 6.58 million won in digital assets. This reflects growing trust in crypto as a mainstream, long-term investment. South Korea’s Exchange Trading Volumes Rival Stock Markets Amid Scrutiny South Korea’s top five crypto exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and GoPax, saw a remarkable daily volume. Together, these exchanges raked in a daily trading volume of nearly 15 trillion won in November 2024. This achievement rivals the daily trading volume of the country’s traditional stock markets . This growth highlights the crypto sector’s maturity and appeal to retail and institutional investors. However, market stability and consumer protection concerns have led lawmakers to push for stricter regulations. In July 2024, the government enacted the Virtual Asset User Protection Act (VAUPA) to set clear exchange standards. This is to improve transparency in trading and protect users from fraud and hacking. The government also plans to regulate cross-border crypto transactions . This includes mandatory registration and reporting to combat money laundering and illicit activities. South Korea; A Nation at the Forefront of Blockchain Innovation South Korea is a leader in blockchain and cryptocurrency, not just in market participation.The country has also adopted blockchain across industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics. The government’s support for innovation has encouraged both startups and established companies to explore blockchain. Looking ahead, analysts predict the South Korean crypto market will grow at 15.7% annually. By 2030, it could reach $635.4 million in revenue. This growth will depend on the government’s ability to balance innovation with market stability.

Cardano Price Prediction & Dogecoin Whale Activity Rises As the altcoin market gears up for a projected $2.5 trillion boom, key players like Cardano, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are showing impressive momentum. The Cardano price prediction highlights renewed whale interest, as large holders accumulate 160 million ADA tokens following its recent dip to $0.91. Similarly, Dogecoin whales are strategically navigating key support levels, aiming for $0.684. On the flip side, BlockDAG (BDAG), with its newly released Whitepaper V3, continues attracting crypto whales looking for the next big crypto. The whitepaper revealed key updates and insights into BlockDAG’s technology and plans for 2025. Moreover, this utility-driven project has made waves in the presale market by raising over $172 million across 26 batches, as it swiftly progresses toward its ambitious $600 million presale target. Cardano Price Prediction: Will it Break $1 and Reach $2.27? The Cardano price prediction is gaining attention as large holders accumulate 160 million ADA tokens following its drop to $0.91. With a 6% recovery, ADA is trading at $0.95, and analysts project it could reach $1.2 within a month if it breaks the crucial $1 resistance. Long-term predictions suggest a target of $2.27, making the $1 milestone pivotal for its upward momentum. While the Cardano price prediction shows potential recovery, challenges remain. Daily active users have dropped by 58%, raising questions about sustained engagement. Additionally, concerns over its ability to maintain key support at $0.90 amidst market fluctuations leave investors uncertain. Can Dogecoin Whale Activity Propel to $0.415? A recent post by @CryptoMichNL on X mentioned that the “Altcoin market capitalization has had a beautiful retest and is expected to continue to $2.5T.” This highlights the increasing momentum across altcoins, including Dogecoin, which continues to draw attention due to whale activity. Currently trading at $0.348, Dogecoin Whale movements have kept its key support level at $0.264 intact, with targets at $0.415 and $0.684. While whales often drive price surges, this reliance raises concerns about market stability. Analysts point out that Dogecoin’s limited use makes it less competitive. Additionally, its unpredictable price swings make some investors hesitant, emphasizing the need for stronger fundamentals to support long-term growth. BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3: Solving Scalability & Privacy Challenges in Crypto The upcoming altcoin boom is projected to push the market to an incredible $2.5 trillion, and all eyes are on the projects poised to lead this explosive growth. At the forefront of this movement is BlockDAG, a next-gen blockchain platform that’s redefining the crypto market. With its presale already raising over $172 million by selling more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG has exceeded all expectations. Those who jumped early into the project have enjoyed a remarkable 2,240% growth in their holdings, as the BDAG coin price surged from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. Adding to its appeal, BlockDAG’s newly released Whitepaper V3 has captivated developers and whales alike, detailing innovative advancements that address scalability, privacy, and compatibility challenges. By integrating the UTXO model for private payments and the account-based model for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, BlockDAG offers the perfect hybrid environment for DeFi, dApps, and NFTs. The whitepaper also highlighted the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, which introduces a partially ordered transaction system that reduces fees while maintaining transaction integrity, setting a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency. This innovation is fueling a surge of interest among crypto enthusiasts, propelling a rapid increase in presale funding. Market analysts are now optimistic that BlockDAG could reach its $600 million presale target before than anticipated. With the demand for BDAG coins surging, the current presale batch is on the verge of closing soon, which will trigger a significant price increase in the next one. For those eyeing this rapidly expanding crypto giant, now could be the perfect time to act before prices soar and BlockDAG becomes as hard to access as other major crypto market leaders. What is the Next Big Crypto? The altcoin market is heating up with Cardano price prediction suggesting a renewed whale accumulation, while Dogecoin whale activity drives key support levels. However, the spotlight is shifting to BlockDAG, which is setting a new standard with its latest Whitepaper V3 and presale success. With its presale smashing the $172 million mark, BlockDAG is rapidly approaching its $600 million target. For those still questioning what is the next big crypto, BlockDAG is emerging as a clear contender, offering unmatched growth potential.

According to Business Insider’s report , Citi analysts led by Alex Saunders stated in a Friday note, “This year was a strong one for crypto, registering a 90%+ increase in the total market cap”. The cryptocurrency market surged in January 2024, with a dozen Bitcoin spot ETFs launching. Thanks to these funds, investors could trade Bitcoin more easily, fueling a positive outlook in the industry. Moreover, the central bank’s rate cuts, along with other policies, encouraged economic growth in September. On Election Day, Donald Trump’s victory was the most significant moment for digital assets. Trump himself was very supportive of cryptocurrencies, and winning his campaign generated a wave of optimism. He appointed many crypto advocates to key positions, and he named Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin reached $100,000 for the first time, thanks in part to Trump’s crypto-friendly stance. Altcoins also benefitted. The surge propelled the total cryptocurrency market to $3.4 trillion, almost double its value last year, even after some turbulence ensuing from the Federal Reserve’s hawkish comments. A favorable economic environment, but how long? Citi analysts believe high-risk trades will stay up through early 2025 against the current backdrop. However, they warn that the outlook could change later in the year as uncertainty persists over what Trump will do about the economy and stock market volatility. The Citi analysts said that “macro may turn less favorable over the rest of the year given heightened US policy uncertainty and forecasted equity volatility.” Continued growth of spot ETFs as a game changer for crypto It’s been a game-changer for the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. After years of scrutiny from the SEC, these crypto funds have made buying and selling cryptocurrency as easy as tracking prices without having to own the coins. Since July, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $36.4 billion in inflows, while Ethereum ETFs have seen $2.4 billion. “These flows have been the most significant driver of crypto returns, and we expect this to continue in 2025,” the analysts stated. Crypto as a part of a multi-asset portfolio Another focus point is the role of crypto in diverse portfolios. During this year’s rally, analysts also noted that adding Bitcoin to multi-asset portfolios did add value. Still, it’s too volatile an option. With allocations larger in percentage, crypto needs to yield much higher rates of returns than equities in the first place to justify that risk. “For a 5% allocation, performance needs to be higher – double-digits using the S&P’s longer-term risk-reward trade-off, or 21% using recent returns where the high reward/risk implies investors need to be compensated well for taking additional risks,” the Citi analysts’ note explained. The Rise of Stablecoins The momentum for stablecoins , i.e., cryptocurrencies pegged to the stability of assets like the U.S. dollar, is increasing. Trump’s victory generated optimism in the robust market for stablecoins, stimulating new issuances and partnership plans. One example is a partnership between Circle and Binance, which can threaten Tether’s lead in the space. Citi analysts see diversification as a positive step, as “it will lessen the potential for systemic risks from a specific issuer. ” They also consider how more stablecoins could be used in wider use cases to spur more adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi). Sustained growth is only possible through adoption According to the analysts, digital asset adoption has to grow if the crypto rally is to continue. Though trading volumes are high and stablecoin values have grown, widespread use of cryptocurrencies is essential. Citi analysts are monitoring Turkey, Argentina, and Venezuela, all of which are facing economic instability that has driven more people to the cash. Citi analysts expect regulation to take a pivotal turn in 2025 Trump’s administration will change the regulatory landscape . The industry is hoping for lighter regulations, and his administration has several pro-crypto appointees. But analysts forecast this will be about clarity rather than full deregulation. “The result is likely to be a shift from regulation by enforcement to a more legislative-based approach.” Analysts added it’s “less a de-regulation story; more so a removal of headwinds.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",News|BTC|Citi,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-25 20:00:58

The proposal has received support from the Binance Thailand CEO, who sees it as a positive step for the country’s competitiveness and ability to attract tech-savvy visitors. However, despite efforts from industry advocates and some political proponents to turn the Kingdom into a digital hub, crypto payments remain outlawed in Thailand by the central bank. Thailand Warming to Crypto? The proposal “reflects not only the momentum of global crypto adoption but also demonstrates that leaders at the highest level are embracing these transformative technologies,” Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance, told the Bangkok Post before adding: “As more countries adopt digital assets and cryptocurrencies, Thailand must not be left behind,” He continued to state that given the country’s reliance on tourism and foreign inflows, “integrating cryptocurrencies into Phuket’s economy could align well with Thailand’s strategic strengths, potentially attracting tech-savvy visitors and investors.” However, there is currently a division of regulatory oversight in Thailand as payment systems come under the central bank’s jurisdiction, while digital assets are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thailand also operates under a restricted currency system, unlike countries like the United States and Japan, which have already implemented Bitcoin payments. Before implementation, several key challenges need to be addressed, and the Bank of Thailand, which has been vehemently anti-crypto in the past, will have ultimate oversight. The central bank needs to thoroughly study the risks, particularly regarding monetary flow and economic stability, and regulatory frameworks need updating through collaboration between the BoT and SEC, which could take time. Consumer protection and anti-money laundering measures also need to be established, according to the report. Foreign Access Restricted The proposal suggests starting with a controlled sandbox environment in Phuket to monitor and assess implications before considering any nationwide adoption. However, the wheels of bureaucracy rotate slowly in Thailand. Additionally, many local payment systems and platforms, such as PayPal and Binance Thailand, are not available to foreigners visiting or residing in the kingdom. Moreover, Thailand’s digital assets market is undergoing a transition from retail to a more institutional focus, Fuwattananukul said in October. At the time, the Thai securities regulator proposed rules that would allow institutional-grade mutual and private funds to invest in crypto products such as US spot crypto ETFs.

As crypto enthusiasts flock to meme coins for their wild returns, three projects are stealing the spotlight: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Popcat (POPCAT). While the market is rife with speculation, BTFD Coin is turning heads with its mind-blowing presale performance—$4.5 million raised and counting—and a festive bonus that’s pure gold for smart investors. Meanwhile, Floki Inu is making waves with its metaverse rollout, and Popcat, inspired by a viral meme, continues to attract a loyal following on the Solana blockchain. Let’s break down why these are the best new meme coins to join this week and which one holds the most promise for your portfolio. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Ride the Bull and Claim the Festive Dip Imagine investing in a project that blends the resilience of Warren Buffett’s market strategy with the meme coin hype of the crypto world. That’s what BTFD Coin is delivering, and it’s nothing short of spectacular. The BTFD presale is now in its 12th stage, and early adopters are already celebrating a monumental $4.5 million raised. With over 59 billion coins sold and more than 6,600 holders on board, the BTFD community is proving that buying the dip is more than a meme—it’s a winning strategy. Features That Set BTFD Apart The BTFD project isn’t just about hype. Built on Ethereum, it offers the security, scalability, and liquidity that every serious investor craves. Its P2E game, currently in beta, is another game-changer. While rewards aren’t live in the beta, the immersive gameplay is already drawing players who see this as the next big thing in crypto gaming. Add staking rewards with a 90% APY, and you’ve got a project that combines fun with financial gains. Tokenomics is another strong suit. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, 48% allocated for presale, and staking rewards vested to maintain stability, BTFD is structured for long-term success. And let’s not forget the referral program—earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if your referral code cracks the top 20. Why the Festive Dip Is a Golden Opportunity Inspired by the 1973 financial crash, where legends like Buffett turned chaos into wealth, BTFD is rolling back prices to $0.000064 for a limited time.

The Bulls Squad, BTFD’s vibrant community, is ready to welcome you to this movement. Floki Inu (FLOKI): From Meme Coin to Metaverse Giant Floki Inu started as a simple meme coin but has quickly evolved into a multi-faceted ecosystem. In 2024, it launched the Valhalla Metaverse game on the mainnet, a play-to-earn platform that merges gaming with NFTs. Players can earn tokens, level up, and even cash out in real-world currencies, making Floki more than just a speculative asset. Highlights of the Floki Ecosystem Beyond gaming, Floki Inu has rolled out a robust roadmap for 2024. This includes regulated digital banking accounts, Floki debit cards, and integration with DeFi protocols like Venus. These advancements show a clear intent to shift from meme coin status to a utility-driven cryptocurrency. While the token’s price has been relatively stable at $0.00017734, its community-driven initiatives continue to build momentum. However, Floki isn’t without its challenges. Critics argue that its reliance on community sentiment makes it vulnerable to market volatility. But with a strong development pipeline, it’s hard to ignore Floki Inu as a long-term contender. Popcat (POPCAT): The Meme That Keeps Popping Popcat, built on the Solana blockchain, is a crypto project that thrives on its meme origins. With a current price of $0.825076 and a history of hitting an all-time high of $2.06 in November 2024, Popcat has carved a niche for itself in the meme coin universe. Its vibrant community and viral appeal are its strongest assets, making it a favourite among younger investors. What’s Next for Popcat? While Popcat’s charm lies in its simplicity, it’s not without risks. The token’s price predictions vary widely, with analysts forecasting a potential decline to $0.80 by year-end but a surge to $10.09 by 2030. Its reliance on meme culture makes it a double-edged sword—great for viral growth but susceptible to fading interest. Despite these risks, Popcat’s loyal following and steady market performance make it a viable option for those looking to diversify their meme coin investments. Conclusion If you’re seeking to invest in the best new meme coins to join this week , BTFD Coin is the undeniable frontrunner. Its robust presale performance, innovative features like staking and P2E gaming, and a community-driven approach make it a must-watch. Floki Inu’s metaverse ambitions and Popcat’s viral appeal also deserve a place in your portfolio, but BTFD’s festive discount offers a rare chance to buy big and potentially earn huge returns. Don’t wait too long. The market waits for no one, and opportunities like these are fleeting.

But if BTC breaks through 100k, volatility could hold firm and spark fresh momentum. Meanwhile, altcoins could steal the spotlight.

It’s not just a dream—it’s the potential reality in the thrilling world of meme coins! Mog Coin (MOG) is making waves with its Coinbase roadmap listing, and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) continues to intrigue with its Truth Terminal AI-backed momentum. But amidst these exciting narratives, one name is attracting bulls: BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Since its presale launch, BTFD Coin has surged past a jaw-dropping $4.5 million in funds raised, selling over 59 billion tokens to more than 6,600 holders. As if that wasn’t enough, the BTFD team has just announced a Limited 50% Festive Bonus, allowing savvy investors to grab tokens at $0.000064 using the code “ BIG50 .” This isn’t just a sale—it’s an exclusive chance to “buy the dip” and ride the wave of a next-generation meme coin designed to redefine the market. Let’s dive deeper into why BTFD Coin leads the pack in the race for Top New Meme Coins with 100x Potential. BTFD Coin: Pioneering Meme Coins with a Game-Changing P2E Beta Picture this: a vibrant community rallies behind the cry to “Buy The Dip” as the BTFD Coin presale crosses a jaw-dropping $4.5 million milestone. That’s right—this presale has already sold over 59 billion tokens, captivating more than 6,600 bulls. And now, its P2E game’s beta version has gone live, setting a precedent for meme coins with true utility. Sure, rewards aren’t active yet, but it’s just the beginning of something big! The BTFD presale is currently in its 12th stage, offering tokens at $0.000064—a hefty 50.77% discount from the launch price of $0.0006. Let’s crunch numbers: an $8,500 investment at this stage could translate into $79,687.50 post-launch. Use the bonus code BIG50 before January 5, 2025, to unlock even greater value.

Buy tokens and secure your stake before the bull market roars back. BTFD isn’t just another coin; it’s a movement bolstered by Ethereum’s scalability, staking rewards, and its flagship P2E game amid top new meme coins with 100x potential hype. Join now and earn big—not just in returns but in bragging rights. Mog Coin: Meme Meets Momentum Ethereum-based Mog Coin has had a wild ride, trading at $2.56 with a market cap nearing $1 billion after its Coinbase listing roadmap announcement. This move ignited a 20% price surge, underlining the power of accessibility and credibility. However, MOG’s volatility raises questions. Bearish signals, including an RSI drop to neutral territory and EMA crossovers hinting at potential declines, leave analysts wary. With 390 trillion tokens in circulation, liquidity isn’t an issue, but sustaining upward momentum might be. Despite these challenges, Mog Coin’s community-driven energy is its trump card. A listing on Kraken, Bybit, and Bitstamp ensures broad access, catering to traders ready to weather short-term fluctuations for potential long-term gains. If meme coins thrive on hype and accessibility, MOG is making the right noise. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): The Meme Coin with AI on Its Side From the creators of the infamous Truth Terminal, Goatseus Maximus trades at $0.49 with a $491 million market cap. At its peak, GOAT hit $1.35, cementing its position as a serious contender in the meme coin world. This wasn’t just hype; Truth Terminal’s AI drove a massive wave of interest, creating a unique narrative around tech-backed tokens. While GOAT’s price has corrected, the project’s long-term potential remains intriguing. With a focus on AI adoption and a decentralised ethos, it’s carving a niche within a crowded market. Investors are drawn not just to its meme coin appeal but to the broader vision it represents—a fusion of technology and community-driven innovation. Conclusion Looking at the latest market trends and the stories unfolding in the crypto space, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is shaping up to be more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement. With its impressive presale momentum, unique ecosystem, and the 50% festive discount on offer right now, the opportunity to invest in a potential 100x winner has never been better. While Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) continues to innovate with its AI-driven push and Mog Coin (MOG) navigates its growing market presence, it’s BTFD Coin that stands out as a prime opportunity among the top new meme coins with 100x potential. Don’t wait until the presale ends and prices skyrocket. With only a limited time to secure tokens at $0.000064, it’s time to act.

This is the first time Israeli investors will have access to Bitcoin-focused mutual funds. The funds, offered by Migdal Capital Markets, More, Ayalon, Phoenix Investment, Meitav, and IBI, will all go live at once, per a condition from regulators. Management fees are set between 0.25% and 1.5%, with one fund standing out by actively managing its portfolio to beat Bitcoin’s market performance. For now, transactions will be limited to once a day, although future funds may allow continuous trading. Regulators finally loosen the reins Investment firms have been begging for this moment for over a year. “The investment houses have been pleading for more than a year for ETFs to be approved and started sending prospectuses for Bitcoin funds in the middle of the year. But the regulator marches to its own tune. It has to check the details,” an anonymous investment executive told Calcalist . This follows in the footsteps of the U.S., where the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs last January. Those funds have attracted $35.6 billion in capital while Bitcoin’s value has doubled, making over five new all-time highs this year. Israel’s crypto industry has been bubbling under the surface for years. The so-called “Start-Up Nation” is home to around 174 crypto-focused companies employing 3,800 people, covering areas like blockchain development and algorithmic trading. Despite the innovation, regulatory bottlenecks have held the market back. Israeli banks are still highly skeptical of crypto transactions, citing fears of money laundering and compliance issues. Many banks won’t even process funds derived from crypto, making it a nightmare for investors to comply with tax regulations. The Israel Tax Authority (ITA) introduced a temporary measure in January to allow taxpayers to report crypto profits through special accounts. That measure has been extended until December 31, but it’s a band-aid for a much bigger problem. Alongside Bitcoin mutual funds, Israel has also gotten into Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The Bank of Israel has been working on a digital shekel, releasing an architecture paper earlier this year and launching a test environment in May. Economically, Israel is on solid ground. The country posted a $4.96 billion current account surplus in Q2 2024, thanks to strong exports and investment inflows. Analysts predict the surplus could grow to $7.8 billion by the end of the year.

To read full editions, subscribe . Starting next year, the SEC will operate with a smaller team of commissioners while we wait for the Senate to approve President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees. SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, both Republicans, are the only sitting commissioners who will remain with the agency after Inauguration Day. After SEC Chair Gary Gensler departs , how the agency approaches the crypto industry should see a big shift , according to Peirce. “We have a big toolkit,” Peirce said earlier this month during an appearance at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit. “We’ve always gravitated toward enforcement in this area as our tool of choice,” she added. “I think when you see new commission changes and the composition changes, then the mix of cases can change as well.” The nature of federal agencies means that some — or most, in the SEC’s case — policy discussions happen behind closed doors, Uyeda added. “That’s why we have the Administrative Procedure Act, to allow the public to comment on regulation,” he said. “That’s our accountability for the American public to provide that transparency.” In cases where agency staff issue guidance that differs from SEC rules (for example SAB 121 ), there is no public comment period. In the case of SAB 121, both chambers of Congress elected to overturn the policy, which states that digital asset custodians should report a liability and “ corresponding assets ” on their balance sheets. President Biden ultimately vetoed the resolution, however. Uyeda looks forward to the agency providing more opportunities for public input. “Writing the shift is hard because we are pretty far down this road,” Peirce said. Addressing the crypto industry directly, she added, “this is going to require a lot of hard work from us and from you to get back on the right foot, but I think we can do it.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 20:30:00

This correction, which played out across the entire crypto industry, saw Cardano break below the $1 mark again on December 18%. Although the broader trend suggests a possible move on the weekly timeframe towards a new all-time high (ATH), recent technical analysis on TradingView has opened up the possibility for a continued correction towards $0.43 before another strong upward move. Current Price Movements Highlight Resistance And Cooling Period According to technical analysis of the Cardano (ADA) price action on the weekly candlestick timeframe, the cryptocurrency has encountered notable resistance around the $1.2046 mark. This resistance has emerged after Cardano’s remarkable 205% surge from $0.4322 in late October to $1.32 in late November. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Wave 2 And 5 Targets Put XRP At $7 And $13 Interestingly, this remarkable price surge saw Cardano form significant lows that serve as support levels for the price. Furthermore, the rally ended up with Cardano entering the overbought zone on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The rally culminated in the Cardano price peaking at 82.87 on the RSI, but it has since retraced into a cooling/corrective period where buying pressure is consolidating at the time of writing. Cardano’s consolidation has opened up outlooks as to its next direction, with substantial buying volumes observed in recent trading sessions. Deep Correction Could Test Critical Support At $0.43 While the long-term outlook remains bullish, the analysis highlights the scenario of a deep correction that could send the Cardano price falling further in the short term. With this in mind, the analyst points to support levels that ADA may revisit in the event of a deeper correction. The first key level at $0.7683 has already proven its significance, acting as a reactionary zone in recent price movements. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Below this, $0.4322 stands as the ultimate support for the current bullish leg. What this means is that ADA has to hold above the $0.43 support level in order for a bullish trajectory to remain valid. Failure to hold above $0.43 is likely to cascade into more price declines at this point and a change into bearish outlook. The analyst also identifies $0.3166 and $0.2427 as primary supports. These levels are Cardano’s lowest support during the previous bear market and are considered less likely to be breached in case of a longer-term decline. Despite the potential for a deep correction, Cardano’s recent market behavior and buying trends suggest a promising long-term outlook. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.912 and has increased by 2% in the past 24 hours. Once the current resistance at $1.2046 is cleared, ADA is well-positioned to challenge its $3.09 all-time high and possibly establish new highs in the current cycle.

Recent data shows the country’s crypto industry growing rapidly, approaching parity with traditional stock market activity. As of the end of November, there were 15.59 million cryptocurrency investors in South Korea, up 610,000 from the previous month, accounting for nearly a third of the country’s total population of 51.23 million. The average daily trading volume on South Korean digital asset exchanges reached 14.9 trillion won (about $10.5 billion) in November, close to the daily trading volumes of the KOSPI Index (9.92 trillion won) and the Korea Enterprise Index (6.97 trillion won). Related News: New Development in the Fate of Terra (LUNA) Founder Do Kwon The total value of cryptocurrency assets held by South Korean investors rose to 102.6 trillion won ($70.3 billion) in November, a significant increase from 58 trillion won ($39.7 billion) in October. This growth reflects broader trends in the global cryptocurrency market. Data from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) showed that South Korea’s virtual asset market capitalization increased by 27% in the first half of the year, reaching 55.3 trillion won ($40.1 billion) at the end of June, from 43.6 trillion won six months earlier. From January to June, the average daily transaction value increased by 67% to 6 trillion won, while market operators reported a 106% increase in operating profit to 590 billion won. The number of market users increased by 21% to 7.78 million, and trader deposits in Korean won increased by 3% to 5 trillion won. *This is not investment advice.

Both are exciting projects, but one stands out for its potential to deliver massive gains. While Filecoin offers stability, Altura is a hidden gem with the chance to grow 10x, 15x, or even 20x. Let’s break it down. Filecoin ($FIL): A Solid but Limited Option Filecoin is a big name in the decentralized storage world, with a market cap of $3.3 billion. It’s already listed on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, making it accessible to millions of investors. But this also means Filecoin’s growth potential is limited. - To 10x, Filecoin would need to grow its market cap to $33 billion, which is very difficult in today’s market.- Realistically, Filecoin has room for a 2-3x growth, bringing it to $6.6–$10 billion. While that’s respectable, it doesn’t match the explosive potential of smaller, undervaluedprojects like Altura. Altura ($ALU): The Undervalued Gem Altura is a much smaller project with a market cap of just $100 million, making it extremely undervalued compared to Filecoin. This gives it a huge opportunity to grow. - If Altura grows 10x, its market cap would reach $1 billion, which is very achievable.- With the right momentum, it could grow 15x or even 20x, reaching $1.5–$2 billion, placing it in the ranks of mid-cap crypto projects. 1. Not Yet on Major Exchanges Altura isn’t listed on Binance or Coinbase yet, which have over 300 million users combined. A listing on these platforms could skyrocket Altura’s price and visibility. 2.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 523,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is looking near-term bearish as it struggles to reclaim key support levels on the weekly chart while it chops around the $90,000 range. “[Monday], Bitcoin showed some signs of a relief rally after which price was rejected to almost new lows. [Tuesday], Bitcoin [was] rebounding yet again and once again into the old support. Overall, as long as the previously lost supports turn into new resistance additional downside should be expected. Conversely, a reclaim of these previously lost supports would obviously be bullish.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also says that a Bitcoin correction during these weeks of the current bull market cycle is not unusual based on historical precedence, and it could set the flagship crypto asset up for rallies. “BTC is offering more confirmation for additional downside than reasons to be bullish for the moment. Once Bitcoin clears its historically corrective weeks seven, eight and nine in price discovery the opposite will be true. It’s Christmas and this retrace is a gift.” Lastly, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin has about 38% left to complete in the bull market cycle based on previous cycles and that the final stage is traditionally the most explosive phase. “Bitcoin bull market progress: 62%. (Progress will speed up in the parabolic phase).” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $98,151 at time of writing, up more than 125% in the last year.

To read full editions, subscribe . Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah to those who celebrate. Kwanzaa kicks off tomorrow too. While Santa’s elves worked hard in the holiday lead-up, bitcoin miners were busy raising money for different purposes. We touched on this phenomenon earlier this month. Bitdeer noted proceeds from its convertible senior notes offering would go toward datacenter expansion and mining rig development. Marathon and Riot Platforms have signaled the route of using raised capital to buy more BTC. More recent announcements from two other segment players continue to highlight that not all BTC miners agree on the best way to spend the capital they secure. Less than a week ago, Hut 8 touted its purchase of 990 BTC for $100 million (avg. price of ~$101,710). Two days earlier, CleanSpark CFO Gary Vecchiarelli noted his company was choosing not to pay such a price for BTC. Very pleased to incorporate this instrument into our capital stack and strategy. Instead of buying bitcoin at prices over $100k, we are investing in our ability to mine bitcoin at a cost under $40k. $CLSK #Bitcoin https://t.co/TZsn0jqayD — Gary A. Vecchiarelli (@GaryVec) December 17, 2024 I followed up with Vecchiarelli. He told me the company is “laser focused on producing bitcoin from our mining operations at a significant discount to the spot price.” The marginal cost to produce each coin last quarter was roughly $36,250, he explained. The company’s main 2025 growth priority is reaching a hash rate of 50 EH/s as soon as possible, while also growing its digital asset management group to manage its bitcoin treasury (9,297 BTC, as of Nov. 30). As Hut 8 buys more BTC, Marathon Digital has used capital from convertible notes to boost its BTC holdings to 44,394 BTC, as of Dec. 18. “We are happy to be different [from] those companies,” Vecchiarelli said, adding that CleanSpark’s healthy margins allow the company to build its balance sheet holdings “in a durable fashion.” Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot made clear to me the company’s strategic bitcoin reserve is “a complement, not a substitute, to our core operating strategy, which prioritizes disciplined, fundamentals-driven growth.” The miner doesn’t have explicit price levels at which it would totally rule out buying BTC, Genoot added — but is “extremely sensitive to valuation extremes and [optimizes] for risk-adjusted returns.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

According to a report by the Yonhap News Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the government of South Korea signed an agreement to jointly develop technologies aimed at curbing attacks on crypto platforms and infrastructure as well as tracking stolen crypto assets. US and South Korean researchers will also focus on how stolen financial assets are laundered or converted into crypto assets using illegal ransomware or other techniques. Per the Yonhap News Agency, the US picked South Korea for the collaborative effort on crypto assets as the country’s neighbor and geopolitical rival North Korea is viewed as a major perpetrator of crypto heists. In August of 2022, for instance, blockchain analysis platform Chainalysis said that North Korea was responsible for most of the crypto heists happening on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. “Much of the value stolen from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can be attributed to bad actors affiliated with North Korea, especially elite hacking units like Lazarus Group. We estimate that so far in 2022, North Korea-affiliated groups have stolen approximately $1 billion of cryptocurrency from DeFi protocols.” Earlier this year, a member of a United Nations expert panel tasked with the monitoring of sanctions on North Korea reportedly disclosed that the hermit state uses the crypto mixer Tornado Cash to launder stolen crypto assets. The hermit state is said to use the proceeds of its crypto heists to fund its nuclear and missile programs.

The head of Kraken Institutional, Tim Ogilvie, said that while prices are up, the volume is far higher. He confirmed that Kraken’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading volumes have increased by 220% in the past year, and other cryptocurrency trading companies have experienced a comparable rise. According to Brett Reeves of BitGo, two-thirds of the exchange’s recent volumes have come in the last three months as a result of the election’s outcome. In mid-2024, the OTC market had low trading volumes, but that changed as the election approached and traders wanted to capitalize on the results. OTC traders explore other liquid cryptocurrencies Desks have noticed that traders are becoming more open to exploring assets beyond well-known ones like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This is because the rise in demand for Bitcoin (BTC) has caused OTC desk inventory levels to drop by the highest monthly volume in 2024. This year, the monthly inventory of Bitcoin OTC desks has been reduced by 26,000 BTC , and since November 20, it has also been reduced by another 40,000 BTC. Alternative coins like Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), and Aave (AAVE) have become well-known assets because of their high liquidity. Institutional players seek liquid markets, which allows them to execute larger trades efficiently, according to Ogilvie. Analysts expect over-the-counter desks will continue to have high demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) while traders investigate the potential expansion in the derivatives markets. They emphasized how big institutions are increasingly using options as a hedging tool. Options linked to Bitcoin ETFs have opened the door for cross-collateralized, affordable products, bringing cryptocurrency closer to conventional financial models. Analysts anticipate that more ETFs, possibly with Solana (SOL) or XRP included, will provide market stability and encourage adoption. The growth of these financial products is anticipated to draw in new funding sources, changing the over-the-counter and overall cryptocurrency environment.

In contrast, Bitcoin’s performance during this year-end trading window has been much less consistent, rising only half the time in 14 holiday seasons since its inception in 2010. While stocks stick to traditional trading calendars, Bitcoin's 24/7 market creates a slightly different year-end dynamic. According to Tyler Richey, technical analyst and associate editor at Sevens Report Research, Bitcoin’s trading volumes have been steadily decreasing since the BTC price surpassed $100,000 earlier this month. Related News: The Central Bank of South Korea issued a statement on Cryptocurrencies: A Positive Development “The decline in trading volume is a sign that bullish sentiment is waning,” Richey said in his comments. Despite this, Richey sees potential for a recovery. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin could rally toward $100,000 after recent weakness triggered by the Fed’s latest moves. “If we see a break above the congestion resistance at $100,000-$101,500 on the daily chart, a retest of the current close and intraday highs of $106,000-$108,000 would become extremely likely,” Richey said. *This is not investment advice.

With $TICS tokens priced at $0.037, the project offers significant ROI potential, with a projected post-presale value of $0.25 and long-term growth targets ranging from $10 to $15. VeChain: Sustaining an Incredible Rally VeChain (VET) has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, experiencing a 215% price surge over the past month, climbing from $0.02 to $0.069. This remarkable growth has added nearly $1 billion to its market capitalisation, now exceeding $5 billion. The upward trend has been fueled by a consistent increase in trading volumes and open interest in VET futures, reflecting growing speculative interest from traders worldwide. December has been particularly strong for VeChain, with no significant price declines, signalling sustained momentum. Technical indicators suggest that VeChain’s rally is far from over, making it an attractive option for those seeking exposure to a high-performing cryptocurrency with strong market dynamics. Hedera: Pioneering Institutional Blockchain Adoption Hedera (HBAR) is making headlines with Canary Capital’s filing for the first HBAR-focused ETF in the U.S., marking a significant milestone for institutional adoption. The announcement sparked a 270% increase in trading volume, demonstrating rising investor interest in Hedera’s blockchain network and native token. Hedera’s enhanced Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility has further solidified its position in decentralised finance, enabling more efficient smart contract deployments and attracting developers seeking scalable solutions. This development and the potential influx of institutional investment positions Hedera as a leading blockchain platform as the global adoption of decentralised technologies accelerates. Conclusion As January 2025 approaches, Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera stand out as the top cryptos to join now for those looking to invest in transformative projects. Qubetics’ AI-driven platform and presale success make it a trailblazer in decentralised application development.

Korea JoongAng Daily published a report detailing the reason behind the court’s decision. First, the court is concerned about the legal inconsistencies in Kwon’s appeal. Ordinarily, these inconsistencies effectively uphold an earlier ruling favoring his extradition. The European country’s minister of justice will have to decide whether Kwon will face trial at home or in the United States. The likelihood of getting extradited to the US seems higher. Montenegro Appellate Court Extradite Do Kwon to South Korea In August, the Montenegro Appellate Court confirmed its decision to extradite the Terraform Labs co-founder to South Korea . It was believed that this ended the prolonged legal battle marked by multiple appeals and judicial reversals. It turned out that the requirements for extradition requests from South Korea and the United States were met. However, the High Court in Podgorica decided that South Korea’s request should take precedence over the U.S. This decision came amidst several complexities in Kwon’s dual extradition requests. Do Kwon in Trouble With Authorities Montenegro’s court decision will likely set a precedent for cross-border accountability in crypto. The authorities are investigating Do Kwon over allegations of fraud, market manipulation, and securities law violations. In the second quarter of 2024, one US court found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for fraud. This was a case initiated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which charged him with misleading investors and recklessly mishandling customer funds. Consequently, the Commission requested approximately $4.7 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. This was alongside a combined $520 million in civil penalties, $420 million from Terraform, and $100 million from Kwon. Terra LUNA Pulls $2 Trillion From Global Crypto Market Cap For context, Terraform Labs faced a major downtrend in 2022 after Terra LUNA/UST rushed and left the broader cryptocurrency market, with losses running to $2 trillion. Since then, Kwon has been at the center of global scrutiny. His investigation cuts across the United States and South Korea, as regulators in both regions accuse him of commuting fraud. He was initially in South Korea but was later arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, so both countries are pushing for his extradition.

To read full editions, subscribe . What better way to celebrate the season than by diving into the holly-jolly madness of holiday memecoins? Pump.fun has been brimming with festive chaos as degens deck the chain with memes and mayhem, so we thought we’d take a moment to unwrap a few of the highlights. First up, the Santas. Purple is the color of the moment, and Santa is apparently taking it in stride. Santa Paws (yes, a cat) appears to be attempting to claw its way to a comeback, while Santa Is Real and Santa Isn’t Real duke it out for festive dominance. Santa wif Hat, meanwhile, is rocking an alarming variety of headgear, from classic red to…let’s just call it “experimental.” And what’s this? Could it be a brigade of naked Santa variants storming the chain, ranging from cheeky to full-on yuletide nightmare fuel ? Aw thanks, frens…you really shouldn’t have. New holidays are making their debuts too. Ever heard of Rizzmas ? Hawktuahnukkah ? Chrismahanukwanzaka ? Me neither, and yet here we are. Degens have made their wish lists loud and clear with aspirational coins like “All I Want for Xmas is (1000X)” and “AllIWANTforXmasIsAMillionBucks.” Ho ho hodl. Oh, and the snowmen…my goodness, the snowmen. They’ve outdone themselves. Frosty the Dough Man — because nothing says “the season of giving” like hoarding bags of cash — is joined by the very swol Abdominal Snowman (you read that right), an alarmingly handsome-Squidward-esque Mewing Snowman, and the ever popular extra thicc Gyatt Snowman, among many , many others . It only gets weirder. There are memecoins featuring homicidal Christmas trees, an unfortunate P. Diddy made of gingerbread, Biden and Trump (both dressed as Santa) kissing under the mistletoe, and a truly inexplicable Jesus made of shrimp (called Shresus, obviously). And then there’s the Grinch. Solana devs can’t get enough of Dr. Seuss’ iconic green grouch. Grinch Mona Lisa? Check . Super Saiyan Grinch? Why not ? Grinch Hawktuah? Sure . If it’s a meme, it’s minting. Finally, if the cold weather is keeping you from touching grass, don’t worry — you can always Touch Snow . From all of us at Lightspeed: Happy holidays, Solana fam!

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 21:34:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing five potentially game-changing altcoins for December and January. Table of Contents XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential Ethereum PEPE Shiba Inu Ethena Conclusion As Bitcoin surges beyond the $100,000 milestone, a wave of opportunity sweeps across the crypto landscape. Altcoins are breaking new ground with record highs, and the resurgence of meme tokens could be imminent. Unveiling five altcoins that might be the key to staying ahead in December and January. XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential XYZverse is the world’s first meme coin tailored for sports enthusiasts. Whether a football fanatic, basketball devotee, MMA fan, or gaming enthusiast, XYZverse creates a dynamic ecosystem where profits meet passion. Its ambitious roadmap aims to dominate the meme coin arena, outpacing competitors like Pepe and Shiba Inu. Starting at $0.0001, XYZ has already reached Stage 9 of its presale at $0.001333, and it’s targeting a listing price of $0.1 — a potential 100x gain at current prices. With the presale still open, investors have an opportunity to join the race before the token hits major exchanges. Why XYZverse is December/January powerhouse: Massive profit potential: With a roadmap targeting a 10,000x return, XYZ combines meme coin hype with the massive appeal of sports. Early mover advantage: Investors in the current presale stage are positioning themselves for exponential gains as the project gains momentum. Broad market appeal: By uniting sports and memes, XYZverse will attract a diverse audience, from crypto degens to dedicated sports fans. As the crypto market accelerates and altcoins break new records, XYZverse emerges as a potential game-changer. Its unique value proposition and growth potential make it one of the most exciting altcoins to watch this season. Interested investors can get XYZ via presale and be part of the next crypto championship . You might also like: Altcoins under $1 that could bring big gains this holiday period Ethereum Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has transformed the digital landscape with smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum’s advancements make it a prominent player in the blockchain industry. The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its diverse applications underpin its strong position. While market trends fluctuate, Ethereum’s technology and potential keep it at the heart of discussions about crypto’s next steps. PEPE PEPE is a meme coin on Ethereum, serving as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, an internet meme by Matt Furie. PEPE aims to ride the popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin. With no taxes and a simple, straightforward approach, it’s attracting attention for keeping things pure and fun as a meme coin. PEPE’s value skyrocketed in 2023, pushing its market cap to $1.6 billion at one point. Whether it will reach new heights in the current market cycle remains to be seen, but its momentum and community support make it an interesting player to watch. You might also like: Polygon meme coin to overtake PEPE and SHIB in the bull run Shiba Inu Shiba Inu began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has grown into something more. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s place on Ethereum means it can do more. It has launched ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. Shiba Inu also plans to introduce an NFT platform and a DAO where holders will help make decisions. This shows SHIB’s potential to be more than just a meme coin. In today’s market, investors look for coins that offer real value, and SHIB’s development could make it appealing. While many meme coins come and go, Shiba Inu is building tools and a community that could last. Ethena Ethena aims to be a stable, crypto-native dollar that doesn’t rely on traditional banks. This means ENA can be used without worrying about the banking system. Ethena also brings the Internet Bond, a global savings tool in dollars, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This bond offers a way to save money and earn interest without needing a bank. In today’s market, where many seek stable and accessible financial options, ENA stands out. The idea of a stablecoin that’s not tied to traditional banks is gaining attention, especially after recent banking uncertainties. By providing both a crypto-native dollar and a global savings instrument, Ethena is positioning ENA to meet the needs of users looking for security and growth in the crypto space. Conclusion While ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ENA are promising, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin for fans aiming for massive growth in a community-driven ecosystem.

33767162,[object Object],1735164033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Whales Go On 270 Million DOGE Buying Spree As Crash Provides Low Entry,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-270-million/,"While widespread liquidations would be expected from the recent DOGE price crash , Dogecoin whales have embraced the downturn as a prime opportunity. Viewing the dip as a chance for a low market entry, these whales now purchase Dogecoin in large volumes , with the latest transactions recording a 270 million buy. Dogecoin Whales Scoop Up 270 Million DOGE The recent decline in the Dogecoin price has prompted large-scale investors, typically called “whales,” to accumulate more tokens. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez disclosed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday that Dogecoin whales have bought a whopping 270 million DOGE tokens in the last five days. This massive 270 million DOGE buy is part of a broader accumulation trend noticed across the meme coin’s network. Since November, Martinez has recorded whales buying hundreds of millions of DOGE during the downtrend. On December 21, the analyst revealed that Dogecoin whales had purchased 250 million DOGE during the recent market dip . This bold move was made as investors saw DOGE’s decline as a favorable entry point, a behavior often associated with more prominent players who buy tokens at a lower price in hopes of long-term gains. The recent DOGE buying spree by whales could indicate strong confidence in the Coin’s future. Martinez has also expressed optimism in the meme coin’s price prospects, highlighting in a previous X post that DOGE could experience another parabolic rally to a $20 ATH. While bullish sentiment for DOGE’s price remains strong , Dogecoin whales are taking advantage of the current market conditions and declining prices to increase their holdings and prepare for a potential rally. With the Dogecoin price currently trading at $0.33, the recent 270 million DOGE buy is approximately valued at $89 million. Pattern Repetition Could See DOGE Price Reaching $5 Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has presented a chart illustrating a recurring historical trend pattern in the Dogecoin price movement. The analyst suggests that a repetition of this historical trend could trigger a parabolic rally for Dogecoin . The red curved lines in the chart highlight DOGE’s rounded consolidation phases in different cycles, while the green ascending lines underscore a steady bullish trend. Each consolidation period in the chart has led to a significant rally, where Dogecoin’s price explodes at the end of the trend. Based on the recurrent historical pattern, DOGE is seemingly exiting its recent consolidation phase , indicating that a potential breakout may be on the horizon. Trader Tardigrade has predicted that the breakout could trigger a price increase as high as $5, marking new all-time highs for DOGE . At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.33, reflecting a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. A surge to $5 would require the meme coin to record a staggering 1,415% surge from its current price.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-25 22:00:33

Predictions for this token suggest gains as high as 16,900%, stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency market. XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XYZ — the first-ever all-sports meme coin — is emerging as a must-watch contender. Combining the energy of meme culture with the passion of sports fans, XYZ is blazing its trail in the crypto space with a forecasted 16,900% surge, potentially rivaling the hype around XRP and Cardano. Why XYZ is capturing investor interest: A new era in meme coins XYZ aims to bring a unique blend of sports, entertainment, and decentralized finance to the table. Its XYZVerse ecosystem will merge prediction markets, sports betting, and interactive dApps, creating a playground for millions of gamblers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Undervalued yet poised for massive growth Currently in its presale phase, XYZ is a hidden gem for early investors. By its Token Generation Event (TGE), XYZ is projected to outperform past meme coin sensations like BOME and WIF. Its roadmap also includes CEX/DEX listings, entertainment platforms, and token burns, ensuring a robust ecosystem and sustained price growth. Community-driven success Unlike many presale tokens, XYZ empowers its community. Active participants can earn airdropped tokens, contributing to the ecosystem’s direction while benefiting from strong tokenomics that prioritize steady revenue streams and liquidity. XYZ offers an alternative pathway to impressive gains in the crypto space. Crypto watchers are taking note of its unique position in the meme coin market, massive potential for growth, and appeal to both sports fans and crypto degens. Intrigued investors can join the XYZ presale for the potential 16,900% opportunity. XRP XRP is a digital currency aiming to make money transfer faster. It’s built on the XRP Ledger — a decentralized system that allows for swift, low-cost, and secure transactions. XRP doesn’t require a bank account for settlements, making it accessible to people everywhere. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be slower and more expensive to use. XRP’s ability to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies aligns well with the growing demand for quick and borderless transactions. As financial systems evolve, XRP’s technology positions it as a potential key player. Its focus on real-world application and partnerships in the banking sector also make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Cardano Cardano is a layer-1 blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized finance apps, create new crypto tokens, and develop games. Similar to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA can be used to store value, make payments, and earn rewards through staking on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake system, which is much more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work model used by Bitcoin. Additionally, Cardano’s blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions quickly — potentially up to a million per second. In the current market, where sustainability and scalability are highly valued, ADA presents an attractive option. As Ethereum faces challenges with high fees and scaling, Cardano’s approach might give it an edge. Conclusion XRP and ADA remain strong options, but XYZ could dominate the 2024 bull run.
