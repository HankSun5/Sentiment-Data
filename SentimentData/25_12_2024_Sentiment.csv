Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Plunged To -0.221% In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst talked about the latest development in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index. The “Coinbase Premium Index” refers to a metric that keeps track of the percentage difference between the BTC price on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means the cryptocurrency is trading at a higher rate on Coinbase than on Binance. Such a trend implies there is a higher buying pressure or a lower selling pressure present on the former as compared to the latter. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests that Binance users are participating in a higher amount of buying than Coinbase ones as they have pushed BTC to a higher value there. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the last few months: From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index has seen a sharp decline into the negative region recently, meaning that sellers have appeared on Coinbase. Alongside this selling, the BTC price has also witnessed a decline, which would suggest the negative premium could be the source of it. The cryptocurrency has actually been following the indicator in this manner throughout the year, with its price going up and down alongside buying and selling shifts on Coinbase. The reason behind this relationship potentially lies in the fact that Coinbase is home to US-based institutional investors, who have had a significant presence in the market this year. The Coinbase Premium Index being red right now would naturally imply these giant investors are selling. Considering that BTC’s price has been following the metric, this would be a bearish signal for the asset. There exists another pattern, however, that could imply a different outcome for Bitcoin. As the quant has highlighted in the chart, the metric has seen a rebound whenever its value has gone to the -0.2% mark during the past year. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Top Above $168,500 Based On This Indicator, Analyst Reveals The explanation behind the pattern may be that it’s usually around this level of selling that new buyers show up and decide to accumulate on the dip, pushing the metric as well as the price up in the process. The current value of the indicator is sitting at -0.221%, so it’s possible that Bitcoin could be close to reaching a bottom, if it hasn’t already formed one. This would only be, of course, if the institutional investors think that the bull run is still on. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly went under the $93,000 level yesterday, but it seems the coin has found a rebound as its price is now trading around $94,100.

The exchange started when Hoskinson said, “Welcome to the new economy,” in a post about a YouTuber, Zara Dar, who left academia for OnlyFans. The AI bot then continued comparing Dar’s changing career path to the problem that the Cardano team is facing with the smart contract. The bot criticized Cardano’s progress, stating, “Bruh, you running Cardano like she running that PhD.” It also stated that Cardano has not fully developed working smart contracts. Hoskinson asked the bot questions and demanded it back up its claims. In response to the question, the bot changed the focus and said, “Your TPS is so low my response might take till 2025 to process.” Viral debate highlights AI bot’s nature The interaction attracted much attention online, and this was because Hoskinson may not have known that he was conversing with a bot. When a user in the community exposed RoastMaster9000 to be a bot, Hoskinson playfully likened his style to Captain Kirk of Star Trek. In different situations, Kirk, the main character of the series, usually beat AI using their own logic. The HOSKY meme coin account linked to the further replied, “Bot 2 Charles 0,” continuing the lighthearted banter. Hoskinson later admitted that he started wondering what the bot was capable of doing as soon as he realized it was an AI. “I have not seen a bot like this one,” he said. “I was naturally curious of how advanced it could be before it loops and deflects.” After the debate, Hoskinson revealed a project called Me-Box at Input Output Global (IOG), which is still in progress. This initiative is aimed at designing avatars of people for social communication. Hoskinson said he was curious about RoastMaster9000, which is the same as his interest in this project. Cardano (ADA) faces correction The price of Cardano’s ADA fluctuated considerably after a strong rally in November and early December. The cryptocurrency peaked at $1.30 in the first week of December before experiencing a pullback. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.9281 and has had a weekly loss of 13.71% and a 24-hour loss of 0.96%. ADA has a market capitalization of $ 32.64 billion and 35.12 billion tokens in circulation. Nevertheless, ADA retains the leading position in the market, and bearish pressure persists in the asset’s pricing. Crypto analyst Zen has noted ADA has a chance of a further bounce back in early 2025. Zen argues that the recent correction could boost the bull run. Similarly, analyst Ali Martinez has compared the current ADA market chart to the 2020 cycle and found similarities that suggest future price increases. In addition to the price dynamics, Cardano’s ecosystem is still being developed. Charles Hoskinson recently complimented Ripple Labs’ Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, calling him “smart and passionate.” This has led to the speculation of a possible collaboration between the two blockchains.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-24 22:12:00

He expected to see “substantial growth” in the crypto ETF volume and inflows in 2025. OSL is allegedly Hong Kong’s largest custodian of local spot crypto ETFs with over 70% market share. Positive Sentiment to Influence Spot Crypto ETF Outlook Miller perceives that the sentiment surrounding the offering has improved significantly locally and globally. On this premise, he sees the future of spot crypto ETFs as brighter. Also, the OSL executive highlighted the incoming administration in the United States, citing that it will present a more favorable stance for the crypto industry. “The new U.S. administration’s favorable stance toward the crypto industry, coupled with interest rate cuts, has positively impacted global sentiment and cryptocurrency prices,” Miller stated. Hong Kong Launch Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs In April 2024, Hong Kong welcomed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs . Hong Kong became the first jurisdiction in Asia to issue a spot Ethereum ETF. Top firms like China Asset Management, Bosera Capital, and HashKey Capital Limited were endorsed by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This was about four months after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted BTC ETFs in America. On the debut trading day, Hong Kong crypto ETFs recorded a combined trading volume of approximately HK$87.5 million , equivalent to $11.2 million. US Spot Crypto ETFs Outperform its Hong Kong Counterparts The Bitcoin ETFs have up to 4,560 BTC, valued at approximately 444.6 million, as of Dec. 11, and the Ethereum funds hold up to 16,280 ETH ($59.6 million). Still, some entities evaluated the crypto ETFs as underwhelming. Compared to their US counterparts, they are grossly underperforming. The US spot crypto ETFs have a stellar record in terms of volume and inflows. These measures increased when pro-crypto Donald Trump won the election and was reelected as US President. As of early December, US spot Bitcoin ETFs already had a cumulative net inflow of over $34.06 billion, while its Ethereum counterparts saw over $1.78 billion.

The last two days of the week saw total outflows of $1 billion. The recent price declines led to a $17.7 billion drop in the total assets under management (AuM) for Digital Asset ETPs, which is likely influenced by the hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve’s dot plot published on Wednesday. Bitcoin Posts Strong Inflows While these outflows are significant, it is also important to note that the figures represent only 0.37% of total AuM and rank as the 13th largest single-day outflow in history, according to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report . In comparison, the largest single-day outflow occurred in mid-2022 when a $540 million outflow (2.3% of AuM) followed the Fed’s interest rate hike. Although Bitcoin saw some outflows during the week, it ended with net inflows of $375 million, indicating strong market sentiment. On the other hand, short-bitcoin products recorded only $0.4 million in inflows, reflecting a lack of significant interest from short-sellers. The “most dramatic” outflows came from multi-asset investment products, which saw a sharp decline of $121 million last week. On the altcoin front, XRP led the inflows with $8.8 million, followed by Horizen at $4.8 million and Polkadot at $1.9 million over the past week, showing a trend of investors favoring more selective opportunities. Chainlink, Cardano, and Litecoin also received modest inflows of $1.7 million, $0.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum continued its positive streak and attracted $51 million, while Solana experienced outflows of $8.7 million during the same period. Switzerland Faces Largest Digital Asset Outflows The US continued to lead in digital asset inflows, drawing $567 million over the past week. Brazil and Australia followed with $16.6 million and $10.2 million in inflows, respectively, while other regions saw outflows. Topping the chart with the most outflows during the same period was Switzerland recording $95.1 million, followed by Germany and Canada with $74.7 million and $60.1 million. Outflows were also recorded in Sweden and Hong Kong, with $42.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively.

Whether you’re seasoned in the crypto space or just starting out, understanding which coin to pick is key. This guide looks into the top five cryptocurrencies poised to excel in 2025—BlockDAG (BDAG), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL). Each offers outstanding features and impressive ROI potential, making them essential considerations for your investment portfolio. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) Presale Surpasses $172 Million BlockDAG (BDAG) is a promising layer-1 blockchain noted for its unique DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) architecture, enhancing scalability and transaction speed while ensuring security. Its innovative hybrid consensus mechanism addresses many challenges faced by decentralized networks, distinguishing it from the conventional Proof-of-Work models. Currently in its presale stage, BlockDAG has successfully raised over $172 million, selling more than 17 billion BDAG coins. With a current price of $0.0234 in batch 26, early adopters have realized a staggering 2240% ROI. What sets BlockDAG apart? It offers smart contract capabilities, secure mining options, and optimized performance. From the user-friendly X1 mobile mining app to the robust X10, X30, and X100 miners, BlockDAG provides an environmentally friendly and efficient mining solution that is unmatched. Analysts believe BlockDAG will experience exponential growth by 2025, potentially surpassing many established cryptocurrencies. Its seamless integration with DeFi and NFT platforms bolsters its status as a top crypto pick for 2025. If innovation and growth potential are what you seek, BlockDAG deserves your attention. 2. Ripple (XRP): Enhancing Speed & Reducing Costs Previously known as Ripple, XRP facilitates transactions across various real-world currencies. Priced at approximately $2.18, XRP has seen notable value growth this year. XRP employs a consensus algorithm that accelerates transactions and reduces costs. The decentralized XRP Ledger supports cross-border payments with minimal fees through a trust-less mechanism. Ripple has also launched a stablecoin, RLUSD, boosting its trading volumes. With a design focused on energy efficiency, XRP stands out as a prime investment opportunity. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Leading in dApps & DeFi Ethereum is a well-established decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi). The recent shift to Ethereum 2.0, adopting Proof of Stake (PoS), has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency. Powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), and augmented by Layer 2 solutions, Ethereum streamlines transactions and reduces costs. With the current trading price around $3,336, forecasts indicate ETH could reach new peaks by 2025, affirming its position as a top investment choice. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Fueling the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB), valued at $676.60, reflects a significant increase over the past year. BNB is integral to the Binance ecosystem, offering trading fee discounts, and powers the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that supports dApps and smart contracts. BNB’s utility spans DeFi applications, staking, and merchant payments. Currently nearing the $265.90 support level, analysts predict a rebound if this level holds, suggesting a strong future performance, making BNB a solid investment. 5. Solana (SOL): Fast Transactions with Low Fees Solana, priced at about $182.65 after a recent 23% drop, could see a turnaround if bullish momentum builds. Known for rapid transactions and low fees, Solana employs a unique Proof of History (PoH) system to enhance efficiency and scalability. With a vibrant ecosystem that includes dApps, NFTs, and DeFi projects, Solana’s ease of integration, eco-friendliness, and developer-friendly tools continue to attract users, making it an attractive crypto investment. Top Crypto to Buy Now As we approach 2025, the cryptocurrency market is ripe with opportunities. While Ethereum, Ripple, Binance Coin, and Solana are all strong contenders with proven track records and ongoing advancements, BlockDAG, with its groundbreaking technology and impressive ROI, captures the spotlight. By highlighting its growing ecosystem and technical advancements, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a dominant force in the competitive crypto market, making it a top crypto to buy for future gains.

Top coins poised for massive growth,https://crypto.news/which-crypto-will-explode-in-2025/,"With Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections, the cryptocurrency market has entered a strong growth phase, reigniting excitement across the space. A long-awaited milestone has been achieved with Bitcoin — its price has soared past the $106,000 mark. The crypto bull market is in full swing, leaving everyone wondering: what’s next? Which coin will explode in 2025? And which crypto has 1000x potential? Here’s a guide to the crypto coins to watch as we head into next year. Table of Contents The criteria for a crypto explosion Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Expert predictions for 2025 Risks and considerations The criteria for a crypto explosion With more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies out there today, only a small portion ever achieve real success. Why? The key lies in their utility, scalability, and adoption. Cryptos that succeed often focus on offering something useful, whether that’s speeding up transactions, cutting down on fees, or boosting privacy. For instance, projects that support decentralized finance or enable smart contracts often gain traction due to their innovative applications. You might also like: What is DeFi? Understanding Decentralized Finance and its uses A crypto’s success depends heavily on scalability — blockchains that can process lots of transactions without slowing down or hiking up costs stand out. This reliability makes them more attractive as demand for seamless digital transactions grows. Strong community support, solid partnerships, and strategic market positioning drive adoption, bolstered by a transparent and experienced development team. Cryptos that are decentralized attract users looking for security, privacy, and control, as no single entity has all the power. This openness builds trust and transparency. Centralized cryptos, on the other hand, often spark concerns about control and transparency since one entity holds the reins. Many users prefer decentralization for its autonomy and lower risk of manipulation. Without these foundational elements, many cryptocurrencies simply fail to stand out in the increasingly crowded market. Top cryptocurrencies likely to explode in 2025 Which cryptocurrency will explode in 2025? As the market evolves, certain coins show immense potential for rapid growth. Here are some crypto coins to watch. Ethereum Ethereum 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Ethereum’s dominance in the blockchain space is clear, with its key role in powering decentralized applications and smart contracts. With the rise of DeFi and NFTs , Ethereum ( ETH ) is well-positioned to retain its dominant position. After transitioning to Ethereum 2.0 in 2022, the network’s scalability and energy efficiency have improved, allowing it to handle more transactions without compromising security. Looking ahead, the Pectra upgrade planned for 2025 will enhance Ethereum’s scalability even further, enabling it to process more transactions and introducing innovative features like social recovery for wallet access. This is expected to make Ethereum even more robust, positioning it for future growth in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. Solana Solana 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Solana ( SOL ) continues to make waves in the blockchain space, standing out for its impressive transaction speed and low fees, which are attracting developers across various industries. The network’s growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force. While it has faced some network issues in the past, Solana’s ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem. With its unique ability to process transactions quickly and an expanding user base, Solana is well-positioned for continued success in 2025​. Chainlink Chainlink 1-day chart, December 2024 | Source: crypto.news Chainlink ( LINK ) is a decentralized oracle network that plays a crucial role in connecting blockchains with real-world data. Its ability to securely transmit external information to smart contracts makes it invaluable to the blockchain ecosystem. With expanding partnerships and increasing use in DeFi and smart contracts, Chainlink is on a strong growth trajectory. As the demand for blockchain-based data services continues to rise, Chainlink is well-positioned to see significant upside potential. Chainlink’s growing adoption, including partnerships with major companies like Google Cloud, SWIFT, and the World Economic Forum, showcases its increasing importance. As demand for decentralized data services grows, Chainlink’s unique position in blockchain infrastructure positions it for significant growth, especially as blockchain technology expands into more industries. Expert predictions for 2025 As 2025 approaches, experts present a range of predictions for Ethereum, highlighting its critical role in the evolving cryptocurrency space. Some foresee ETH breaking new records, possibly surpassing $5,000, fueled by growing demand and its limited supply dynamics. Other projections are more optimistic, envisioning ETH prices potentially crossing $10,000, fueled by institutional interest and strong market fundamentals. Predictions for Chainlink’s performance in 2025 vary, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Analysts suggest that LINK could climb to a range of $30.69 to $38.26 by year-end, driven by growing adoption and ongoing technological advancements. Others, like Nick Petisce, suggest a more optimistic outlook, proposing that LINK could soar to $2,000-$6,000 within the next 3-5 years, driven by the adoption of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and partnerships with major financial institutions. Similarly, Solana has garnered attention for its high transaction speeds and low fees, attracting developers across various industries. While specific 2025 price predictions for SOL are less prevalent, the network’s growing presence in decentralized finance and gaming underscores its potential to emerge as a leading force in the blockchain space. Ongoing upgrades in scalability and developer tools are enhancing its ecosystem, positioning Solana for continued success in the coming years.

Even strong projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are not exempt from market turbulence or external disruptions like regulatory crackdowns. Price volatility can lead to significant losses if you’re not prepared. Predictions from experts offer guidance but don’t guarantee outcomes. Additionally, the crypto space often attracts fraudulent schemes, making due diligence crucial. Take time to analyze each coin’s fundamentals, consider its long-term potential, and never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

38074272,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322348,1735080979,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38074272.jpeg,Argentina Freezes $3.5M USDT Linked to Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme: Report,https://cryptonews.com/news/argentina-freezes-3-5m-usdt-linked-to-rainbowex-ponzi-scheme-report/,"Argentine authorities have taken decisive action against Rainbowex, an alleged Ponzi scheme that defrauded thousands of investors, primarily in Buenos Aires’ San Pedro region. A judicial order compelled Tether, the issuer of USDT, to freeze approximately $3.5 million in cryptocurrency linked to the platform on December 24. The investigation into Rainbowex has led to multiple raids, arrests, and international warrants. Source: iProup Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme Busted: How $3.5M USDT Was Frozen Following Multiple Arrests and Raids According to the source close to the case , the legal action to freeze Rainbowex’s digital assets follows months of intensive investigation and enforcement operations. Argentine law enforcement agencies conducted over 15 raids nationwide, targeting locations associated with Rainbowex and its operators. As a result, four individuals, including Luis Pardo, Maximiliano Braga, Facundo Villalba, Mariano Diez, and Andrés Desanzo, were apprehended. An additional arrest warrant was issued for Alexis Pan, who remains at large. The authorities’ efforts also extended beyond Argentina, as the Buenos Aires Justice Department coordinated with Interpol to issue red notices for two Malaysian nationals believed to be key figures behind the scheme. The raids yielded important evidence of the scheme’s operations, including the seizure of 30 million pesos (worth approximately $1.48M) in cash, distributed across various currencies such as dollars, yuan, and euros. This crypto seizure is yet one of the biggest this year. Investigations revealed that Rainbowex posed as a legitimate crypto investment platform, promising substantial returns. However, investors began reporting issues when they attempted to withdraw their funds, which ultimately exposed the platform as a fraudulent closed-loop system disconnected from public blockchains. The Role of Tether and the Controversy of USDT Blacklisting It was noted that Tether’s ability to blacklist wallets implicated in illicit activities helped largely in the asset freeze process. Following a court order, Tether disabled transactions for the wallet holding Rainbowex’s USDT, which effectively froze all the funds. Rodrigo Mansilla, a blockchain expert, explained that the blacklisting process renders any transaction—whether sending or receiving USDT—impossible once a wallet is flagged. This functionality, embedded in the USDT smart contract, checks the wallet’s status before permitting transactions. If the address is blacklisted, the contract sets a boolean value to “false,” blocking any movement of assets. While this mechanism is lauded as a critical tool for law enforcement, it has sparked debate over the decentralization of stablecoins. “This centralized blocking capability calls into question the supposed decentralization of USDT, even when stored on a decentralized blockchain,” Mansilla expressed. Mansilla pointed out that although USDT operates on decentralized blockchains, Tether’s ability to control it centrally contradicts the core principles of decentralization. Maximiliano Firtman, a computer specialist, shared a similar sentiment on the blacklisting process, noting that Tether’s ability to freeze assets indefinitely raises concerns about the potential for permanent loss of funds. However, Firtman also indicated that Tether could mint new tokens to replace the frozen USDT and transfer them to a wallet designated by the judiciary, potentially mitigating the impact on victims. The collaboration between public authorities and the private sector was instrumental in advancing the investigation. Lemon exchange, alongside blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Qlue, provided technical expertise and access to critical data. Judicial sources also confirmed that these companies shared extensive database information, which enabled authorities to track Rainbowex’s financial movements and build a robust case. An earlier report in October revealed that up to 20,000 people had reportedly invested in a fraudulent USDT-themed crypto scheme from RainbowEx . The scheme was promoted by actors and an enigmatic figure called “La China.” The post Argentina Freezes $3.5M USDT Linked to Rainbowex Ponzi Scheme: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Argentina|Ponzi Scheme|USDT stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-24 22:56:19

On-chain metrics indicate a notable shift in exchange activity, with Tether (USDT) seeing significant outflows while Bitcoin (BTC) inflows into exchanges remain elevated. This trend suggests a potential “imbalance” in market dynamics, where selling pressure could lead to further price corrections in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Fueling Potential Dip – $90K Support Crucial Level To Hold Spot Market Trends and Selling Pressure Signal Possible Downturn According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Onatt, more than 15,000 BTC have been observed moving into exchanges, a metric typically associated with an increased likelihood of sell-offs. Simultaneously, Tether outflows imply a reduction in liquidity within these exchanges. Tether Outflows and Bitcoin Inflows Signal Short-Term Weakness “Significant amounts of Tether (USDT) are exiting exchanges, and a large inflow of Bitcoin (BTC) (>15K) has been observed entering exchanges.” – By @tutunculeronat Link 👇https://t.co/NFCLi7EpiI pic.twitter.com/6lUyTiEdNi — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 24, 2024 Historically, such movements have been linked to short-term price declines, as traders and institutional investors reposition their portfolios amid market volatility. However, Onatt noted that while these indicators suggest short-term downside risk, there appears to be no significant macroeconomic catalyst to drive a prolonged bearish trend. The analyst particularly wrote: This combination of factors may indicate a potential for further short-term downside in Bitcoin’s price. However, from a macroeconomic perspective, there doesn’t appear to be a catalyst that would necessitate a prolonged bearish trend after this short-term correction. Key Indicators Suggest Mixed Signals in the Bitcoin Market TraderOasis, another analyst, highlighted additional metrics influencing Bitcoin’s price behavior. One key observation focused on the Coinbase Premium Index, which failed to follow Bitcoin’s upward movement during its last price surge. Oasis noted: As a result, the price retreated. We are now in negative territory. I expect a break in the market for the continuation of the rise. Notably, this disconnect indicates a lack of strong buying activity from US-based investors, often considered a significant driver of Bitcoin’s upward momentum. The analyst also noted that the funding rates have started to decline while open interest levels have been rising. Falling funding rates coupled with rising open interest typically indicate that traders are opening more short positions. This pattern suggests bearish sentiment in the derivatives market, with traders expecting a continuation of the downward trend or, at best, a period of sideways movement.

According to a new report from the state-controlled TASS, the complete ban will affect regions including Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, Chechnya, and the recently annexed territories of Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The prohibition is reported to remain in effect until March 15, 2031. In addition, three Siberian regions — Irkutsk, Buryatia and Zabaikalsky — will face seasonal mining restrictions during peak energy consumption periods. These limitations will run from January to mid-March 2025, expanding to November through March in subsequent years. The measures follow cryptocurrency mining legislation signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2024, aimed at preventing power shortages and blackouts. The energy-intensive nature of proof-of-work crypto mining has reportedly strained Russia’s power grid, particularly in regions with limited infrastructure, according to TASS. Both individual miners and mining pools must cease operations during restricted periods, marking Russia’s most aggressive step yet to address its energy challenges while maintaining economic stability. Earlier this year, Bitcoin ( BTC ) miners based in Russia mined billions of dollars worth of the top crypto asset by market cap last year.

Additionally, a number of myths are often associated with the technology, which may hamper adoption in the future. Forrester Report Highlights Enterprise Blockchain Myths Forrester Research released a new report detailing the most common blockchain myths from 2014 until present day. Martha Bennett, VP and Principal Analyst at Forrester, told Cryptonews that she compiled the list. She explained that the findings were based on insights and observations gained from research and work with clients on the topic of enterprise blockchain over the years. Bennett shared that she started her research in mid-2014 and hasn’t stopped since. “Over the years key themes associated with blockchain technology have emerged that were frequently taken at surface value by IT and business teams in enterprises,” she said. “I spent lots of time explaining to clients (and non-clients, for that matter) what was myth and what was reality.” Although blockchain has matured greatly over the years, Bennett believes that the myths listed below continue to persist – here’s why: The Blockchain Exists The Forrester report notes that phrases such as “the blockchain will address that” or “putting something on the blockchain” create confusion. This is why it’s worth stressing that the blockchain doesn’t actually “exist.” The report states that “blockchain is an architectural principle that features certain characteristics.” It also states that the underlying concept of blockchain can be realized differently. For instance, there are dozens of public, permissionless blockchain networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A wide variety of open-source and proprietary protocols are also available to build permissioned networks. In addition, there are semi-public and hybrid networks whose governance models offer a blend of permissioned and permissionless functions. “Many software offerings aren’t blockchains by any stretch of the imagination because they don’t use blocks,” the report notes. “However, these offerings label themselves as such.” Blockchains Disintermediate And Trusted Third Parties Are No Longer Needed The second myth is that blockchain networks won’t ever fully disintermediate. While blockchain networks support the direct transfer of value between two parties, third parties are still needed for enterprise blockchain use cases. “The only way to cut out third parties altogether is for consumers or businesses to self-custody their wallets and interact with a blockchain directly, which is not a realistic proposition for mainstream business relationships,” the report states. “Even in scenarios where ecosystem partners deal directly with each other at the expense of existing third parties, it doesn’t mean third parties are no longer part of the mix.” The document adds that cryptocurrency use cases rely on third parties, such as wallet providers, exchanges, and custody services. Blockchains Are Decentralized Third on the list of myths is that blockchains are decentralized. However, decentralization is more complex than it may seem. decentralization is THE single most important tenet in crypto. without it, we’re really no different to traditional financial systems. — TINA (@thetinaverse) December 23, 2024 “Even the public Bitcoin and Ethereum networks aren’t completely decentralized,” the report states. “On the contrary, miners and core developers in effect exercise a form of central control, and those small groups aren’t accountable to anybody.” Findings also state that elements of centralization are present in cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (Dapps) . As a result, it’s noted that the term “decentralization theater” has become popular for describing networks or applications that claim to be decentralized but aren’t. Blockchains Are Trustless While a blockchain network can facilitate the exchange of information between people or entities that do not know or trust each other, that doesn’t mean the technology is entirely trustless. According to the report, participants still trust the functioning of these networks. For example, participants need to trust the mathematics and cryptography, along with the network’s code. Users also need to trust those who effectively control the respective networks, such as those with the resources to add blocks to the chain and the developers who can modify the core code. Blockchains Are Immutable A key characteristic of a blockchain network is immutability, yet the report explains that this isn’t always the case and notes that for enterprises, immutability isn’t always desirable. According to the report, changes can be made to the blockchain. “One is to recompute the chain, either in its entirety or to the point before an undesirable event occurred; this erases and recreates history,” the report states. “The other is to fork the chain, which preserves historical code and transactions but means the software now works differently, and ownership may have been reassigned.” Blockchains Are Inherently More Secure The report also points out that blockchains may not be more secure unless these features are designed into the network . For instance, in some cases, participants will have access to credentials to access a network. This creates a security vulnerability. Even networks with multiple nodes are susceptible to attacks. Nodes are the backbone of blockchain. Verifying transactions, ensuring security, and powering decentralization—every node is a piece of freedom in Web3. Want to truly support the crypto revolution? Run a node and join the movement. #Blockchain #Crypto #Decentralization pic.twitter.com/A4GFTbbGGS — Oleksandr Bagnyuk (@AlexBagnyuk) December 15, 2024 “The more nodes there are in the network, the more choices there are for somebody with evil intent to find one that’s less well protected,” the report states. Blockchains Are “Truth Machines” While blockchains may be viewed as single sources of truth, malicious actors can still take over. The report points out that if somebody registers property ownership, the system can’t tell whether this is really the rightful owner. “Similarly, it can’t tell whether the consent for data usage has been obtained legitimately,” the report states. “Sensor data can be manipulated, either by tampering with the sensor itself or by intercepting the data stream.” Blockchains Automatically Improve Data Quality Although blockchain networks work well for ensuring data integrity, the report highlights that data quality issues must be addressed before information is written on the blockchain. The same applies to data that triggers a smart contract. “If nobody establishes and ensures the required data quality standards before the network launches or data is written to a blockchain-supported back end in a centrally controlled service, the shortcoming will be obvious very soon,” the report notes. Transparency Can Only Be Good All transactions on the blockchain are transparent, but this isn’t always beneficial for enterprises. Given this, the report notes that confidentiality is the biggest technical challenge developers need to resolve. Although progress has been made around confidentiality-preserving mechanisms, these remain complex. “Algorithmic zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) — aren’t ready for enterprise prime time,” the report states. S mart Contracts Will Make Lawyers Redundant The myth that smart contracts will replace lawyers is addressed as myth number 10. While smart contracts are able to automate certain processes , the report notes that “code is not law.” “Even if participants in a network wish to abide by the results of smart contract execution, they still need a separate legal agreement that states as much and captures other standard contractual principles,” the report states. Build It, And They Will Come As blockchain technology matures, enterprises are thought to be more likely to adopt solutions. This may not be the case, though. The report notes that between June 2022 and January 2024, many enterprise blockchain initiatives ended in failure. Fortunately, decision-makers who want to avoid a similar fate are now realizing key lessons. According to the report, enterprises must consider ecosystem partners’ and customers’ needs and wants. Businesses using blockchain solutions should not expect a commercial model to develop organically. Finally, enterprises should conduct in-depth research on blockchain software before implementing a solution. The report warns that large businesses must proceed carefully when using blockchain technology. “A key contributor to the failure of TradeLens was Maersk’s dominant position in the market. Even if everything else had been just so (which it wasn’t), Maersk’s sheer size concerned smaller ecosystem participants, which feared Maersk would learn too much about them, while Maersk’s major competitors weren’t that interested in becoming part of a Maersk-led network, despite IBM’s participation,” the report states.

Table of Contents XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently Cardano’s rise amid market shifts Lightchain AI to transform blockchain technology Why Lightchain AI could steal the spotlight Tokenomics and roadmap A seasoned trader has declared XRP’s price is now firmly anchored above $1, signaling strong momentum for the token. While XRP celebrates this milestone, the spotlight is shifting toward Cardano (ADA) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , two projects poised for explosive growth. Cardano’s consistent development and robust ecosystem continue to attract attention, but it’s Lightchain AI, priced at just $0.003 during its presale, that’s stealing headlines. With unique technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), LCAI is redefining blockchain and AI, offering unmatched growth potential. XRP breaks $1 barrier permanently XRP, the cryptocurrency issued by Ripple, recently surged above the $1 mark. This significant increase has been attributed to several factors: Regulatory developments – The New York Department of Financial Services approved Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, pegged to the U.S. dollar. This approval is expected to enhance XRP’s value and utility within Ripple’s digital payments platform. Political climate – The election of President Donald Trump has led to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Trump’s appointment of Paul Atkins, known for his supportive stance on cryptocurrencies, as SEC head may ease previous legal challenges faced by Ripple. Analysts are optimistic about XRP’s future, with some predicting that it could reach a price range of $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025. However, investors should remain cautious, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Cardano’s rise amid market shifts In the middle of new market changes, Cardano (ADA) has shown great rise. Over the last four days ADA’s price jumped by 32%, making its market value $14.932 billion and firming it as ninth-largest coin by market value. This big rise shows more interest and trust in Cardano from investors. Additionally, money rates for Cardano have gotten a clear lift. This shows more hope among traders. People are happy to pay extra for long bets, which m͏eans they think prices will go up some more. These changes show Cardano’s ability to take advantage of market speed and make itself a strong player in the changing crypto world.

At the heart of its technology lies the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which is set to redefine blockchain validation. Unlike traditional methods like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI will incentivize nodes to perform meaningful AI computations, such as model training and inference. This will not only enhance scalability and security but also reduce energy consumption, making Lightchain AI a sustainable alternative for modern blockchain applications. Also central to its technological breakthrough is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a state-of-the-art computational layer optimized for AI workloads. The AIVM will enable developers to deploy advanced, data-driven dApps with high efficiency. Supporting interoperability with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, the AIVM will ensure smooth integration of existing models into Lightchain AI’s ecosystem. Through these innovations, Lightchain AI will set a new benchmark for decentralized intelligence, fostering a transparent, inclusive, and high-performance blockchain environment. Lightchain AI’s approach to decentralization will also tackle systemic issues like AI bias and centralized control. By incorporating federated learning and decentralized governance, the platform will empower community-driven decision-making and ensure fairness in AI applications. With its presale already in Stage 8, raising over $4.16 million, Lightchain AI is not just a technological platform — it’s a revolution poised to reshape the blockchain landscape.

Chosun Ilbo reported that progress has stalled on a deal that would s ee Megazone, a cloud service provider, take control of GOPAX. The latter is one of South Korea’s five fiat-trading crypto exchanges. The deal is complicated by the fact that GOPAX is currently majority-owned by the global crypto exchange giant Binance .

And industry sources have come to the conclusion that Megazone has effectively given up on the acquisition deal.” A further wrinkle comes in the form of GOPAX’s debt to creditors as a result of the failure of its GOPAY crypto staking services.

GOPAX has told creditors that it wants to repay unpaid balances “in cash based on the price at the time of the collapse.” But disgruntled creditors say they want their Bitcoin back “as-is.” Chosun wrote that if Megazone “pulls out of the deal, the exchange will not meet financial authorities’ demands. And it explained: “Not only is it extremely unlikely that a new buyer will emerge, but it is also obvious that Gopax’s debt will be a hindrance during takeover negotiations.” Did you know Korea has over 100,000 coffee shops for a population of just 51 million?

The firm received the all-clear, but the newspaper wrote: “If the authorities do not accept the renwal application, citing the change in major shareholders as a problem, GOPAX will have to go through the process of closing down. And then repaying its debts will become even more difficult.” Chosun quoted an unnamed industry insider as saying: “GOPAX has fulfilled all the legal requirements it could.

38074275,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322547,1735083470,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38074275.jpeg,Sui (SUI) Price Analysis – Break Above $5.0 Imminent as On-chain Activity Booms,https://cryptonews.com/news/sui-sui-price-analysis-break-above-5-0-imminent-as-on-chain-activity-booms/,"The Sui (SUI) bulls remain very much in control on the eve of Christmas Day 2024, with the price last around $4.60, only just below the record highs it hit near $5.0 earlier in the month. SUI continues to find strong support upon retests of its major moving averages, including an impressive bounce last week from the 50DMA. That suggests appetite to buy the dip remains elevated, and pressure could be building for an explosive pop above the $5.0 level in the coming weeks. The bullish Sui price action shouldn’t come as a surprise against the backdrop of booming on-chain activity, souring trading volumes, and a fundamental backdrop that remain a strong tailwind for crypto markets going into 2025. Per DeFi Llama , the USD value of crypto locked in smart contracts on the Sui blockchain is at record highs near $1.8 billion, on-chain volumes are routinely clocking in in the $400 million to $600 million range, and perp volumes are trending back towards their highest levels of the year. Sui’s official X page recently tweeted a summary of the blockchain’s bumper year of growth. 2024 was so awesome for the Sui community, words just aren't enough… …so we decided to use numbers! And trust us, the numbers in this recap are truly impressive pic.twitter.com/W8DwuRYHeh — Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 23, 2024 Meanwhile, though Fed caused a stir in risk assets when it signaled fewer rate cuts in 2025 than the market had been anticipating last week, hopes remain high that the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration and Congress is going to usher in a new golden era for the crypto industry and markets in the US, accelerating global adoption. Bitcoin will steal most of the headlines in 2025 given the potential establishment of a US Bitcoin strategic reserve . However, high performing chains like Sui are also primed to explode. Schwab says #Bitcoin could hit $500K–$1M when Trump establishes a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/3cArfgRYTU — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 6, 2024 Where Next for the Sui (SUI) Price? All that being said, a near-term breakout to the north of $5.0 seems highly likely for the Sui price. But with Sui already in a phase of price discovery, there aren’t too many easily identifiable price targets for the crypto. A 2x rally to $10 is certainly a possibility. But considering Sui’s current market cap of around $46 billion fully diluted ($13.5 billion circulating), much greater than 2x gains could be in store for the crypto. Sui is currently proving itself as one of the best performing layer-1 protocols in the game, and there is scope for significant catch up to its larger rivals like Solana and Ethereum. Solana’s fully diluted market cap was last around $116 billion, while Ethereum’s was last $420 billion, with both also likely to expand significantly in 2025. Could Sui also reach a fully diluted valuation in the hundreds of billions this cycle? It’s certainly a possibility, assuming its chain continues to lead in terms of web3 adoption, as is currently the case. A Sui price in the $20 range becomes a realistic target with if assumptions hold. That means its a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now . Of course, crypto investors would be best served by spreading their portfolio across a few high-potential coins. Bitcoin could still post 2x gains next year, or even more if strategic reserves gain ground. Other leading tokens like Ethereum and Solana are also likely to perform very well. But Sui is certainly a great addition to any investor’s crypto portfolio.

Ripple (XRP) has reclaimed its bullish momentum, surging past key resistance levels and positioning itself for a strong breakout. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT), despite showing technical promise, struggles to break free from its bearish grip, leaving traders and analysts divided on its immediate future. Amid this dynamic landscape, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves as a groundbreaking presale project. Backed by a high-profile partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is redefining the blockchain wallet ecosystem and expanding into untapped territories like Real World Asset Tokenisation. With over 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly becoming a hot topic in crypto circles. Let’s dive deeper into these three standout projects—Qubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot—to understand why they’re among the best crypto to join this week and how each is carving its niche in the blockchain ecosystem. Qubetics: A Revolution in Blockchain Utility The buzz around Qubetics is palpable, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it aims to bridge real-world applications with blockchain innovation. The recent partnership with SWFT Blockchain has turbocharged its wallet features, offering lightning-fast cross-chain swaps and unmatched security. But the star of the show is its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Game-Changer Imagine a system where property, art, or even corporate bonds can be tokenised and traded on a decentralised platform. That’s precisely what Qubetics is bringing to the table. With this feature, businesses and individuals can turn tangible assets into digital tokens, unlocking liquidity and facilitating seamless global transactions. Picture a small business in Argentina seeking to expand operations. By tokenising a valuable piece of equipment or real estate, the business can attract international investors without the hurdles of traditional finance . Similarly, a professional in Brazil could use Qubetics to diversify their portfolio, owning fractional shares in assets previously out of reach. For individuals, the possibilities are equally exciting. A young entrepreneur in Chile could tokenise intellectual property, securing funding for a startup. This marketplace isn’t just a tool—it’s a paradigm shift, breaking barriers and democratising access to investment opportunities. Why Qubetics Shines Bright What makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to join this week is its ambitious vision paired with tangible solutions. It’s not just about hype; it’s about delivering real-world impact . With 374 million tokens already sold and over $7.7 million raised, the presale’s momentum is hard to ignore. Ripple: Riding the Bullish Wave Ripple, known for its focus on cross-border payments, has always been a strong player in the crypto world. Recently, XRP’s price action has reignited excitement, with the token stabilizing above $2.10 and setting sights on breaking the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP’s resurgence can be attributed to several factors. First, its stronghold in the financial sector, with partnerships spanning major banks and payment processors, reinforces its utility. Recent technical analysis reveals a bullish breakout above $2.20, with XRP trading at $2.25 and targeting the $2.30 resistance. This movement aligns with broader market trends, showcasing XRP’s resilience amid Bitcoin and Ethereum’s fluctuations. Analysts are optimistic that clearing the $2.30 hurdle could push XRP toward $2.50 or higher, reaffirming its relevance in the crypto landscape. Why Ripple Stands Out XRP’s focus on real-world applications, particularly in cross-border remittances, makes it an enduring favourite. Its ability to weather market volatility and emerge stronger underscores its potential as one of the best crypto to join this week. With technical and institutional support, Ripple is well-positioned for sustained growth. Polkadot: A Sleeping Giant? Polkadot has long been hailed for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability. However, its recent price movements have left traders scratching their heads. Despite breaking out of a falling wedge pattern, DOT remains in bearish territory, currently trading at $6.83. Mixed Signals in the Market Polkadot’s technical indicators present a mixed bag. On the one hand, the falling wedge breakout suggests potential for a bullish reversal. On the other hand, resistance at $10.88 looms large, making traders wary. Social sentiment around Polkadot is growing, but it hasn’t translated into sustained upward momentum yet. One bright spot is the increased activity in Polkadot’s derivatives market, with long positions slightly outpacing shorts. This indicates some confidence among traders, but the road to a significant rally remains uncertain. Why Polkadot is Worth Watching While Polkadot may not be on an immediate upward trajectory, its robust ecosystem and focus on scalability make it a project with long-term potential. For those looking for diversification in their crypto portfolios, Polkadot remains a project to monitor closely. Understanding Real World Asset Tokenisation with Qubetics Asset tokenisation is not just a buzzword—it’s the future of finance. By converting physical assets into digital tokens, Qubetics enables seamless trading, increased liquidity, and broader access to investment opportunities. How It Works Qubetics’ platform uses blockchain to create digital representations of assets, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. These tokens can be traded globally, bypassing traditional financial systems and their associated costs. Why It Matters This technology opens up new avenues for Latin American countries, where financial systems can be restrictive or volatile. Whether it’s securing loans, attracting foreign investment, or participating in global markets, tokenisation empowers individuals and businesses . The Final Thoughts Based on our research, Qubetics, Ripple, and Polkadot each bring unique value to the table. Qubetics stands out with its ambitious vision and real-world solutions, particularly its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Ripple’s resurgence highlights its resilience and utility, making it a strong contender in the cross-border payments space. Meanwhile, Polkadot’s innovative approach to interoperability positions it as a long-term bet despite its current challenges. If you’re looking for the best crypto to join this week, Qubetics’ ongoing presale is an opportunity worth exploring. With its focus on groundbreaking technology and real-world applications, it’s poised to redefine the blockchain landscape. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey.

Currently trading around $0.30, the Dogecoin price has seen a sharp drop of 25% over the past week, worrying traders and investors as it struggles to hold onto important support levels. This drop raises concerns about a possible further decline. Crypto trader Kevin predicted on November 13 that the Dogecoin price would fall to between $0.26 and $0.28, and this prediction has now come true. Despite facing criticism, he believes that tjw Dogecoin price will eventually recover and aim for new highs, but it may have to go through a significant drop first. Kevin noted that the Dogecoin price is experiencing a typical pullback in a bull market after a “golden cross,” which usually signals future price increases. He highlighted that previous drops have been about 50%, and a 45% pullback could establish key support, keeping the uptrend intact. However, the Dogecoin price closing below $0.26 could signal serious market issues, while the current decline is viewed as normal. RCOF Presale: Invest Now, Reap Huge Rewards While the Dogecoin price is losing steam, RCO Finance is emerging as a frontrunner with its token presale. Projections suggest an astounding 20,000% surge in token value by the first quarter of 2025, attracting a growing number of investors eager to acquire RCOF presale tokens.

However, the token price is expected to increase to $0.2142 when it enters the Bonus Round, and it could rise even more as it approaches its anticipated listing price of between $0.4 and $0.6.

He still holds a lot of ETH and believes in its future. Experts are hopeful that Ethereum’s price will rise again. Justin Sun sold ETH, The rumor Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX), rumors about him claiming that he sold a large amount of his Ethereum (ETH). These rumors have started after data showed huge transfers from wallets linked to him. The timing of these transfers also combined with Ethereum’s recent drop in price which made people think Sun was selling his ETH. The issue started when Justin Sun was said to have moved about $143 million worth of Ethereum which is 39,999 ETH to HTX. These transfers happened soon after Ethereum’s drop below $4,000 and that dropped to $3,127. However, Sun explained on X post that he did not sell his Ethereum. He said that the transfers were just internal wallet movements and also confirmed that he still believes in Ethereum’s long-term potential, despite the price drop. Despite the transfers he still holds about 42,904 ETH which is worth around $139 million. Reports show that Sun has moved over 108,919 ETH to HTX since November 10 at an average price of $3,674, time of these transactions usually when prices are high.

Its trading volume, now at $28.64 billion, has also dropped slightly. Analysts think Ethereum could recover well, with some spotting patterns that hint at a possible price rise. Analyst Javon Marks identified “Adam & Eve Double Bottom Pattern,” which could push Ethereum above $4,000 and possibly up to $4,800 in the near future. Despite recent price changes, Ethereum is still a major player in the blockchain world. Its strong role as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and ongoing technological improvements make it an important part of the crypto ecosystem. Sun’s renewed support for Ethereum reflects the overall optimism about its future growth and success.

Popcat (POPCAT) is one such example. Those who jumped on the train early witnessed exponential growth, while others watched from the sidelines, regretting their hesitation.

Why BTFD Coin Stands Out BTFD isn’t just banking on hype; it’s building an ecosystem that rewards its holders. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards offering an eye-popping 90% APY, and a referral programme incentivising community growth, the project is designed for long-term success. The beta version of the P2E game is already live, showcasing the team’s commitment to delivering value even before the presale ends. While no rewards are earned in the beta version, the final game promises to integrate BTFD tokens, allowing players to earn while they play. Additionally, BTFD’s Bulls Squad—a vibrant community of investors—adds a layer of resilience and collective power to the project. As part of this squad, you’re not just investing in a coin; you’re joining a movement dedicated to seizing opportunities during market dips and riding the wave to financial success. Presale Success and Investment Example The BTFD presale has already raised over $4.44 million, selling more than 58 billion tokens to over 6,500 holders. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, scarcity is engineered into tokenomics. Let’s put the potential gains into perspective. If you invest $3,000 at the current Stage 7 price of $0.000064, you’ll secure approximately 46,875,000 BTFD tokens. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $28,125—an astounding return on investment. Join the BTFD Presale Before the BIG50 Deal Ends Getting in on the action is straightforward: Go to the Presale site and connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code “ BIG50 ” in the designated field to claim the discounted Stage 7 price. Input the amount of BTFD tokens you wish to purchase. Review the discounted price and confirm your purchase. This limited-time offer ends on January 5, 2025, so don’t wait too long. The next bull market could be your gateway to financial independence, and BTFD Coin is your ticket. Popcat: The Missed Opportunity Popcat ($POPCAT) burst onto the scene with a quirky yet captivating backstory tied to the viral Popcat meme. It was a community-driven project that leveraged the power of Internet culture to gain massive traction. Early investors who recognised the potential of this unique meme coin reaped the rewards as the token’s value skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high of $1.67 in October 2024. Popcat’s Meteoric Rise and Fall POPCAT’s initial success was fuelled by a robust marketing strategy, high-profile exchange listings, and a dedicated community. Its listing on Binance and KuCoin added legitimacy and liquidity, attracting a wave of new investors. The token’s market cap surged as it climbed the crypto rankings, making headlines and creating overnight millionaires. However, like many meme coins, POPCAT’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. After hitting its peak, the token experienced a significant correction, losing over 65% of its value in the following months. This downturn highlighted the volatile nature of meme coins and the importance of timing in the crypto market. Those who missed out during the early stages of POPCAT’s rise often look back with regret, wondering what could have been. Why BTFD is the Best Bet Right Now The story of POPCAT serves as a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration. It underscores the potential of meme coins to deliver astronomical gains but also the necessity of getting in early. With BTFD Coin currently in its presale stage, history is offering a second chance. Don’t be the person who looks back and says, “I should have invested.” Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Next Big Thing The world of cryptocurrency moves fast, and opportunities don’t wait. Popcat’s meteoric rise and subsequent correction are reminders of the potential rewards and risks in this space. While many missed the chance to turn POPCAT into a financial windfall, BTFD Coin presents a fresh opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a promising project. With its limited-time rollback to Stage 7 pricing and an ecosystem designed for long-term growth, BTFD Coin is undoubtedly the top crypto presale of the moment. Act now, claim your discount with the code “ BIG50 ,” and secure your stake in BTFD Coin before the presale ends. Don’t let this chance slip through your fingers—join the Bulls Squad today and make 2025 the year you seize the dip and soar to new heights.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 00:26:40

However, the same cannot be said for centralized finance protocols, whose losses have more than doubled in the past year. Hacken’s report shows that DeFi losses represented 20.4% of the total crypto hacks losses, while CeFi accounted for 30% in 2024. However, compared to last year, DeFi losses lessened by 40%, dropping from $787 million in losses to only $474 million in losses this year. CeFi losses skyrocket to $694M in 2024 CeFi losses grew dramatically, rising to $694 million from $339 million in 2023. The DMM Bitcoin hack in May 2024 stood out as the largest CeFi breach, with losses reaching approximately $305 million. About 4502.9 BTC was transferred to an unknown wallet, before being redistributed to other addresses. Another major CeFi hack, the WazirX hack, accounted for 42.8% of Q3 crypto losses, with nearly $240 million siphoned. An attacker breached their system, acquiring signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, enabling them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and drain the funds. Despite the DeFi sector achievements, some protocols were still heavily affected by hackers’ exploits including Radiant Capital. The DeFi firm lost over $55 million after a hacker gained access to their system using some malware, manipulating legitimate transaction approvals, and bypassing the protections of hardware wallets. Over $1.7 billion was lost to access control exploits in 2024 Over $2.3 billion has been drained by hackers from the crypto space in 2024. Both the DeFi and CeFi sectors were heavily hit by access control vulnerabilities. Access control exploits accounted for 75% of all crypto hack losses and nearly half of all DeFi losses, draining more than $1.7 billion. In addition, phishing scams drained over $600 million in 2024. Most of them were a combination of inclusive celebrity-endorsed rug pulls and presale scams. Hacken’s report even highlights that hacks and breaches across crypto and metaverse platforms persisted into 2024, due to weaknesses in private key management systems, poor security measures, single-signature vulnerabilities, and insecure private key backups.

Besides, several experts have further fueled optimism with anticipation over a surge in crypto ETFs this year. So, here we explore some of the top altcoins to watch like XRP, SOL, HBAR, and others, amid the ETF buzz. Top Altcoins To Watch Amid Crypto ETF Buzz XRP, SOL, HBAR, and others, are among the top altcoins to watch now, with soaring ETF anticipation after Donald Trump’s election win. For context, these leading altcoins have gained immense traction with recent insights from Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart. The analysts predicted that Litecoin and Hedera ETFs are likely to debut first, given their regulatory clarity compared to Solana and XRP. The first wave of crypto ETFs is expected to include Bitcoin and Ethereum dual offerings, which have already gained traction among institutional investors. Firms like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Hashdex have filed for these ETFs, signaling their confidence in regulatory approvals. These products could set the stage for top altcoins ETF, especially for assets like Litecoin, which is recognized as a commodity. Hedera stands out due to its classification outside the “ security ” label by the SEC, making it a prime candidate for early ETF adoption. On the other hand, XRP and Solana face regulatory hurdles that may delay their ETF launches, though their market popularity keeps them in the spotlight. This evolving landscape could redefine crypto investments, introducing new opportunities for both retail and institutional players. Market Optimism Soars Amid ETF Anticipation The crypto market has witnessed significant gains after Trump’s win in November. For context, the market is anticipating a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US under the Republican government. It also creates buzz on ETF, with investors keeping a close watch on the top altcoins. In other words, the ETF buzz has been one of the prime catalysts behind the price surge of these cryptocurrencies. XRP price soared 63% last month, trading at $2.238, with a 30-day range of $1.296 to $2.869. Its quarterly growth reached an impressive 278%, with a $127 billion market cap ranking it the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. HBAR price surged 116% over the past month to $0.31, marking a 424% quarterly gain. It ranks within the top 20 by market cap at $11.87 billion. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) price dropped 21% last month to $192 but recorded a 28% quarterly gain. It holds a $92 billion market cap, ranking as the 6th largest cryptocurrency.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is attempting to break from its downtrend, with some market watchers suggesting it is poised for a massive run in 2025. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 Ethereum Key Levels To Reclaim With only a week left in 2024, several market watchers have started forecasting the crypto market’s potential performance for next year. Despite the recent pullbacks, several analysts have predicted a remarkable performance for Ethereum in 2025. The King of Altcoins has struggled to turn the $4,000 level into support. After breaking past this level earlier this month, ETH has been rejected from this price range three times. Its latest attempt occurred a week ago when Ethereum soared to $4,100 before retracing 7.3%. As Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $92,000, the second-largest crypto continued its freefall to the $3,100 support zone, reaching its lowest price in a month. Since then, Ethereum has hovered between $3,200 and $3,550 but failed to break past the price range’s higher zone for the past four days. However, the cryptocurrency has broken out of its downtrend line and is attempting to reclaim the $3,500 support. A crypto analyst noted that ETH appears to have broken and retested its one-week downtrend after reclaiming the $3,400 support. According to the post, a “clean breakout” of this downtrend could lead the cryptocurrency to a retest of higher levels. Ali Martinez highlighted that ETH’s next big support zone was between the $3,032 and $3,132 price range, with 4.85 million ETH bought by 3.69 million addresses. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s next big resistance wall is between $3,640 and $3,740, where over 2 million addresses bought around 4.3 million ETH. To Martinez, “a sustained close outside this no-trade zone will determine the direction of ETH’s trend.” Will ETH Follow 2021’s Performance? Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that “the first four months after U.S. elections are often highly bullish for ETH.” Per the chart, Ethereum registered massive gains in the first third of the year after the 2016 and 2020 US elections. In 2017, Ethereum started the year with a 31.92% increase in the first month, while it recorded a 78.51% surge in January 2021. In both years, ETH hit its peak monthly performances between March and April, seeing 214% and 44% returns in 2017 and 2021, respectively. If Ethereum repeats this historical performance, its price could surge above its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 in January and continue to climb during the rest of Q1. Crypto trader Immortal noted that Ethereum’s recent performance resembles its 2020-2021 price action. According to the chart, ETH saw a significant rise in early 2021 before consolidating in its new range. This was followed by a breakout and a massive drop to retest consolidation zone. Related Reading: Solana Recovery Momentum Set The Stage For $194 Resistance Breakout However, when ETH reclaimed its breakout levels in 2021, the cryptocurrency continued rallying toward its previous ATH of $4,300, eventually hitting its current ATH at the end of the year. The trader notes that ETH is retesting the consolidation range after last week’s dip, which signals that the cryptocurrency could soar in the coming weeks if it follows a similar path. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,501, a 6.3% increase in the last 24 hours.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 849,000 YouTube subscribers that if the Federal Reserve doesn’t bring back quantitative easing (QE), then ADA could continue to slip. “There’s also a chance [ADA] could go lower, especially if it follows what it did last cycle… If it were to drop 56%, that would actually put you below $0.60, which is right where it went last time… There’s always a chance that it comes back down to [the $0.357 price level], because [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell just says ‘no QE, continue on playing in the sandbox and the cryptoverse and we’ll give you QE sometime later.’ There’s a chance that happens.” Quantitative easing is when a government’s central bank purchases financial assets to increase the money supply and stimulate economic activity. Cowen goes on to say that ADA’s technical indicators, such as its 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and 21-week exponential moving average (EMA), are lining up with the theory that the crypto asset could see another sizeable dip. “The other thing to look at is the bull market support band. The bull market support band for ADA to Bitcoin – you can see that first of all, it wicked below it [in mid 2023] but it had a weekly close right around the 20-week SMA. [Earlier this year] it was just above the 21-week EMA, so I would also keep an eye on that. The 20-week SMA for ADA is around $0.56 [and] the 21-week EMA is around $0.67, so that would also correspond to [a price tag of around $0.53].” ADA is trading for $0.89 at time of writing, a 3% increase during the last day. On December 2nd, it was valued at $1.21.

This deal will help the company provide over 70 MW of power at its Lake Mariner facility. This shift from Bitcoin mining to AI will bring in more money and meet the growing need for energy-efficient infrastructure . TeraWulf Expands into AI Infrastructure TeraWulf Inc., mining company recently announced an expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. On December 23, the company revealed that it had signed agreements to lease data center space to Core42 which is an AI and cloud services provider. According to the deal, TeraWulf will provide over 70 megawatts (MW) of data center power at its Lake Mariner facility in Upstate New York. The infrastructure will also be rolled out in phases between the first and third quarters of 2025. These data centers will be set up to support Core42’s GPU clusters, using advanced Dell Integrated Rack Scalable Solutions. This partnership marks an important shift for TeraWulf, placing the company at the crossroads of two fast-growing industries: AI computing and Bitcoin mining. By leasing its data center space to Core42, TeraWulf is diversifying its sources of income and increasing its long-term earnings potential. The company has mainly focused on Bitcoin mining with sustainable operations and is now expanding into AI as a new business model. The increasing demand for efficient, scalable computing infrastructure in both AI and cryptocurrency sectors gives TeraWulf a great opportunity to benefit from these growing markets. TeraWulf’s CEO, Paul Prager , stressed how important this partnership is. He said it helps the company expand beyond Bitcoin mining and positions it as a leader in AI-driven computing. He pointed out that moving into AI will be a key factor for future growth, especially as the company continues to use mostly zero-carbon-powered infrastructure. This fits with TeraWulf’s larger goal of offering energy-efficient and scalable solutions to meet the growing demand for digital infrastructure. The data center lease agreement will provide TeraWulf with a steady and profitable income over time. The leases have two five-year renewal options and the chance to add 135 MW of power, which shows there is a lot of potential for growth. TeraWulf’s ability to quickly set up customized data centers also puts it in a good position to meet growing demand in both the AI and cryptocurrency sectors. TeraWulf’s move into AI comes at a time when Bitcoin mining is facing challenges. The cost of Bitcoin mining increases depending on several factors, such as electricity prices, hardware efficiency, and the mining space. Increase in Bitcoin Mining rates A recent report by CoinShares showed that the cost to mine a Bitcoin increased by 13%, reaching $55,950 in Q3 2024. This rise in costs has caused Bitcoin miners, including TeraWulf, to lose market share. Many are cutting back on mining to focus on AI projects, with some even buying Bitcoin directly instead of expanding their mining operations. TeraWulf’s move into AI-driven computing is part of a wider trend in the cryptocurrency mining industry, where companies are seeking new revenue sources due to rising costs. The company’s stock was affected by these challenges, with its price dropping 12.1% on December 23, reflecting broader market trends. However, TeraWulf has had a strong performance in 2024, with its stock price up by 152.6%, partly due to Bitcoin’s rise in value. As businesses and governments continue to seek AI solutions currently, the demand for this type of computing is expected to rise. TeraWulf’s focus on providing AI infrastructure powered mostly by zero-carbon energy gives it an edge in this market. TeraWulf’s partnership with Core42 is a smart move that sets the company up for long-term success in both AI and cryptocurrency. While it faces challenges in Bitcoin mining, its shift to AI-driven computing could help the company grow. With its focus on energy-efficient infrastructure, TeraWulf is well-placed to take advantage of the increasing demand for both AI and cryptocurrency services.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 01:34:00

This Revolutionary Layer 1 Presale is Redefining Blockchain Potential,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-xrp-this-revolutionary-layer-1-presale-is-redefining-blockchain-potential/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunities, and for those of us who’ve been watching for the next big thing, it’s clear: the blockchain space is evolving faster than ever. If you’ve skipped out on Ripple’s XRP, one of the industry’s well-known players, don’t worry – there’s a new project that’s capturing attention with its revolutionary technology and groundbreaking potential: Qubetics ($TICS) . In a landscape dominated by projects like XRP, which have brought significant changes to the world of cross-border payments, Qubetics is a fresh contender that’s setting out to redefine what a Layer 1 blockchain can do. With its presale already raising over $7.7 million and more than 374 million tokens sold, Qubetics ($TICS) is on track to offer some of the most promising returns in the space. But what makes Qubetics stand out against established players like Ripple? Let’s dive into the features, recent developments, and price predictions to find out why Qubetics might just be one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today . 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Scalability and Interoperability Qubetics is an emerging Layer 1 blockchain that is already capturing attention for its innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. Currently in its 14th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $7.7 million and sold more than 374 million tokens, with prices set to surge by 10% as it enters the 15th stage. At just $0.0377 per token, Qubetics represents a potential goldmine for early investors. Qubetics is unique in that it focuses not only on blockchain scalability but also on cross-chain interoperability, allowing seamless communication and transactions between various blockchain ecosystems. This is an area where Ripple and other established projects have had limitations. While Ripple focuses on payments, Qubetics is looking to create an all-encompassing Layer 1 blockchain solution that connects multiple blockchains , making it easier for developers and users to access various ecosystems without friction. Recently, Qubetics has been integrating with top blockchain players, laying the groundwork for a robust and interconnected ecosystem. This opens up possibilities for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise solutions that benefit from its speed, low fees, and high scalability. The ongoing presale has generated immense interest, and analysts are predicting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, providing investors with a 564% ROI. Decentralised VPN: Real-World Use Cases One of Qubetics’ standout applications is its Decentralised VPN . This feature offers a unique solution to individuals and businesses in Southeast Asia, where internet privacy and access restrictions are common concerns. Imagine a business in Indonesia wanting to protect its online operations from surveillance or a professional in Vietnam needing to access global websites without restrictions. With Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN, they can do so securely, bypassing local network restrictions and ensuring that their online presence remains anonymous. For businesses looking to securely engage with clients across borders, a Decentralised VPN built on Qubetics could offer peace of mind, knowing that their communications are encrypted and decentralised, free from the reach of central authorities or government interference. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Qubetics’ innovative approach to scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability sets it apart from other Layer 1 blockchains like Ripple. Its real-world applications, such as the Decentralised VPN, and its ongoing presale success make $TICS a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to secure long-term returns in the blockchain space. 2. Ripple (XRP): The Giant of Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP has been a dominant player in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space for years, particularly in the realm of cross-border payments. Its focus on providing a fast, secure, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking systems has earned it a strong reputation. Priced at around $0.438, XRP remains one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for anyone seeking exposure to the payments industry. Ripple has seen significant adoption in the financial services industry, with a growing list of banks and financial institutions integrating its technology to streamline cross-border transactions. XRP’s real-time settlement system, known as RippleNet, continues to expand, providing a faster alternative to traditional SWIFT transfers. However, despite its success in the financial sector, Ripple has faced regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States. The ongoing lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cast a shadow over XRP’s future. The outcome of this legal battle could have long-term implications on XRP’s price and regulatory status, potentially affecting its ability to continue growing as a global payments solution. Despite these challenges, XRP remains a Top Altcoin to Buy Today for those looking for a solid investment in the payments sector. Its strong partnerships, established use cases, and solid network make it a reliable choice, though investors must be mindful of the regulatory uncertainties. Why did Ripple (XRP) make it to this list? XRP’s continued dominance in the cross-border payments space and its solid market performance make it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today, especially for those seeking a trusted and well-established asset in the crypto market. However, potential regulatory risks mean that investors should keep a watchful eye on its future developments. Qubetics vs. Ripple for Short-Term and Long-Term Gains Let’s take a closer look at how an investment of $8,000 would perform in both Qubetics and Ripple. With Qubetics, the current price per $TICS token is $0.0377. If you were to invest $8,000 in Qubetics at the current presale price, you would receive approximately 212,870 tokens. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, giving you a 564% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $51,435. If $TICS continues to rise after the presale and reaches $1, your $8,000 investment would grow to $212,870, representing a 2,555% ROI. Even more optimistic projections suggest that $TICS could hit $5 after the mainnet launch, making your $8,000 investment worth $1.06 million—a 13,176% ROI. The explosive potential of Qubetics is hard to ignore. On the other hand, if you were to invest $8,000 in Ripple at the current price of $0.438 per token, you would be able to purchase approximately 18,270 XRP tokens. While XRP has shown steady growth, analysts predict more moderate returns, with a potential rise to $0.50 over the short term. This would offer a 14% ROI, making your $8,000 investment worth around $9,120. Ripple’s price growth tends to be more stable, but its future is tied to regulatory outcomes, which could impact its short-term and long-term growth prospects . Why did Qubetics make it to this list? The potential for exponential returns from Qubetics in the presale phase makes it one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors looking for high-growth opportunities. While Ripple remains a solid and reliable asset, Qubetics’ innovative features and rapid growth make it the more compelling option for short-term and long-term gains. What Are The Top Altcoins to Buy Today Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out as a revolutionary blockchain project that offers greater potential for growth compared to Ripple (XRP). While XRP continues to dominate the cross-border payments space, Qubetics provides a broader vision with its focus on scalability, decentralisation, and interoperability. The Qubetics presale has already raised over $7.7 million, and with a unique application like the Decentralised VPN, it has positioned itself as one of the Top Altcoins to Buy Today for investors seeking high returns . If you missed the boat on XRP, now is the time to consider Qubetics. With explosive potential, an innovative approach, and a presale that’s already showing incredible growth, $TICS is the Top Altcoin to Buy Today for anyone looking to capitalise on the future of blockchain technology. Don’t wait—secure your $TICS tokens today and watch your investment grow as this revolutionary project continues to unfold!

Celestia, for instance, is turning heads with its innovative Web3Bay project, promising to be the next big thing in decentralized e-commerce. Meanwhile, EOS is mounting a comeback, thanks to updates that enhance scalability and functionality, reigniting investor interest. Both projects are gaining traction, making them standout options in the hunt for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , quietly but confidently taking the crypto world by storm. Its presale has already sold over 374 million tokens, raising $7.7 million from more than 11,700 holders. But what sets Qubetics apart isn’t just the numbers—it’s the utility. With its game-changing wallet developed in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, Qubetics is tackling real-world crypto problems head-on. Let’s dive into how these projects are shaping up. Qubetics: The Wallet That Changes Everything Qubetics isn’t just about selling tokens; it’s about delivering real value. Its non-custodial multi chain wallet , created in partnership with SWFT Blockchain, is all about simplicity and security. Whether you’re paying for groceries or managing a diverse crypto portfolio, this wallet turns complex blockchain transactions into everyday ease. Let’s break it down: Say you’re a business owner. A customer pays you in Ethereum, but you need cash. No problem—Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism automatically swaps crypto into fiat at the point of sale. This means you’re shielded from crypto’s notorious volatility while still enjoying the benefits of digital payments. The presale numbers tell a story of trust. With over 374 million tokens sold and $7.7 million raised, Qubetics is clearly striking a chord with investors. At $0.0377 per token, the window to join is closing fast before the 10% price hike in the 15th stage this weekend. If you’re scouting the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, Qubetics deserves a spot on your shortlist. Celestia: Building the Future of Web3 Celestia is on a mission to revolutionize the blockchain world with its modular approach. By separating consensus and data availability, Celestia allows developers to create highly customizable blockchains, which could pave the way for the next wave of Web3 applications. But here’s where it gets exciting: Web3Bay. Dubbed the “eBay of Web3,” this platform aims to transform decentralized e-commerce. Imagine buying and selling goods online with total transparency and no intermediaries skimming off the top. Celestia’s role in this project positions it as a leader in the Web3 revolution. Of course, no project is without risks. Celestia’s success hinges on developer adoption and the broader market’s appetite for Web3 solutions. But with its innovative tech and growing ecosystem, it’s a strong contender for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. EOS: A Comeback in the Making EOS has been through its fair share of ups and downs, but 2024 might just be its redemption arc. Known for its high-speed transactions and low fees, EOS is making a comeback with updates aimed at improving scalability and interoperability. These enhancements are designed to attract both developers and investors, positioning EOS as a viable alternative to Ethereum. Recent developments have included partnerships with several dApps and initiatives to improve community governance. The EOS Network Foundation has also ramped up efforts to increase adoption, focusing on sectors like gaming and DeFi. But can EOS reclaim its former glory? While the project shows promise, its path forward isn’t without challenges. That said, for those willing to bet on a comeback story, EOS remains one of the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024. Conclusion In a market as dynamic as crypto, diversification is key. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking wallet and strong presale performance, offers practical solutions that set it apart. Celestia is redefining what’s possible with Web3 applications, and EOS is showing that comebacks are very much a thing. If you’re looking for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, these three projects are worth a closer look. Qubetics stands out for its innovation and investor confidence, while Celestia and EOS bring unique strengths to the table. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Celestia (TIA), and EOS (EOS) as the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 .

Although the critical support above $2.10 has remained intact, indicating a strong buyer interest at below levels, the lack of any positive news that had the market in a state of euphoria in the first weeks after Trump’s election appears to be cooling down inflated expectations. The on-chain data, however, paints a different picture for XRP. According to Santiment data shared by Twitter/X crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales have accumulated 40 million XRP over the last 24 hours, suggesting that seasoned market participants are closely watching for the new breakout. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has added 3.08%, which may be a sign that the market is starting to react to renewed whale activity. Should the momentum continue, XRP may reclaim the recent highs at the $2.7 level. Currently, the main potential catalysts for the XRP price to watch for are RLUSD stablecoin listings, XRP spot ETF approval, and progress in the Ripple vs SEC case. RLUSD stablecoin went live on December 17 on XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, with initial listings on several exchanges and crypto platforms, including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA. Although it’s reasonable to assume that any attempt to corner the saturated stablecoin market will be met with fierce competition from established issuers Tether ($140 billion worth of USDT) and Circe ($43 billion worth of USDC), the use cases and utility brought by RLUSD are expected to drive demand for XRP as well. Considering that Ripple’s stablecoin is yet to be listed on Binance or Coinbase, any upcoming listings are likely to be treated by the investors as “buy the rumor, sell the news” events. After the successful debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, the crypto industry is anticipating approval for other Layer 1 cryptocurrencies, including XRP and SOL. Major players like WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have already filed for XRP ETFs and the leadership change at the SEC brought by Trump’s win makes the approval a much more likely thing than one would expect under Gary Gensler’s reign. Finally, the resolution of the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case also seems like a plausible outcome after Gensler’s resignation effective on Inauguration Day. With crypto-friendly Chair Paul Atkins at the helm, the new SEC is likely to drop non-fraud lawsuits, experts forecast. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.30, positioned at the level of the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) but holding above the 21-day EMA at $2.24. These indicators suggest a potential short-term bullish momentum, as the price is consolidating near its faster EMA and maintaining support above its medium-term trendline. Should the price successfully move away from its 9-day EMA, this would reliably signify the start of an upward trend. Conversely, a fall below the 21-day EMA would mean the inability to sustain momentum, leading XRP to potentially retest a $2.10 support. For context, the exponential moving average is a type of a moving average indicator that assigns more weight to the recent prices, making it more sensitive to the latest price changes when compared to a simple moving average. The 9 and 21-day EMAs are commonly used by traders to identify short-term trends. RLUSD gets listed on Bullish On Tuesday, Bullish, an institutional crypto exchange backed by tech mogul Peter Thiel, officially listed Ripple’s much-anticipated stablecoin. The exchange users will be able to trade it across seven pairs, namely RLUSD/USDC, BTC/RLUSD, XRP/RLUSD, ETH/RLUSD, USD/RLUSD, EUR/RLUSD and SOL/RLUSD. Before Bullish, RLUSD also went live on Bitso, Independent Reserve, and Mercado Bitcoin. The stablecoin became available to the general public shortly after Ripple managed to secure approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement. According to CoinMarketCap , RLUSD currently has a market cap of $53 million, which places the stablecoin at the 2,978th place ranked by market capitalization. Over the past 24 hours, it generated a trading volume of $8.6 million, a 719% increase from the day before. RLUSD will be initially available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK, and Middle East regions, CoinDesk reported, quoting Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoin at Ripple. The token won’t be available for EU customers due to the lack of a necessary license to comply with the bloc's MiCAR regulations, although the company is actively exploring ways to enter the European market.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-25 01:49:10

A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson highlights that TON has moved into a favorable risk zone for accumulation, as indicated by the Normalized Risk Metric (NMR). This metric evaluates an asset’s price risk relative to historical data, providing a clearer picture of whether the current price levels are suitable for investment or if caution is warranted. Related Reading: Toncoin Consolidates: Could A Breakout Push TON Higher? Toncoin Current Market Outlook The NMR uses moving averages such as the 50-day and 374-day simple moving averages (SMA) along with logarithmic differences in price data to determine risk exposure. A normalized score ranging between 0 and 1 indicates the level of risk, with values closer to zero suggesting a lower chance of price decline. According to Wedson, TON’s current placement in the green zone signals reduced risk, making it an appealing opportunity for investors seeking long-term exposure to the asset. The analysis further suggests that while the medium and long-term risk profiles appear favorable, there remains a possibility for TON’s price to revisit historically significant support zones, often referred to as the “blue zone” on price heatmaps. Historically, these levels have served as price floors and accumulation points for investors expecting future price appreciation. Open Interest Decline and Market Volatility Trends Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, has added further context to Toncoin’s current market stance. According to his observations, TON’s Open Interest (OI) in the futures market has decreased to $141 million, marking the lowest level observed in the past nine months. Open Interest refers to the total value of outstanding futures contracts and is a key indicator of market sentiment and participation. A decline in Open Interest generally signals reduced market activity and lower volatility. While this trend is specific to TON, it reflects a broader pattern across the cryptocurrency market as the year comes to a close. Historically, periods of low Open Interest are often followed by significant price movements, either upward or downward, once liquidity returns to the market.

PEPE recently witnessed a dramatic 30% price drop after soaring to record highs, stirring questions about its future prospects. Concurrently, the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 points to a potential $10 value, sparking debates over the viability of its environmentally friendly blockchain to achieve sustained growth. Amid these fluctuations, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as a top crypto of 2024. Attracting significant attention, this project has amassed over $172 million in presale contributions and achieved an impressive 2,240% ROI since its inception. With its advanced hybrid blockchain and directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology, industry insiders are bullish about BDAG’s prospects to hit the $1 mark, positioning it as the prime crypto to get your hands on. PEPE Suffers a Sharp 30% Decline Post-Peak PEPE’s journey took a downturn recently, with a sharp 30% fall from its peak price of $0.0000293 on December 9. This significant dip has triggered skepticism regarding the sustainability of its initial explosive growth, suggesting it might have hit its peak. Technical analysis shows bearish trends, hinting at a possible further drop to $0.0000105 if crucial support levels fail. While there’s hope among some circles for a bounce back, others are bracing for a possible extended decline, advising caution among followers. Near Protocol’s 2025 Forecast: Climbing to $10 The outlook for Near Protocol has garnered mixed reviews from experts, some are optimistic about its future, while others caution against potential obstacles. Current predictions place its price at around $10.01 by 2025, fueled by its scalable and energy-efficient technology. Despite notable advancements in decentralized apps and its green tech credentials, Near Protocol contends with uncertainties from market dynamics and regulatory environments. Currently priced at $5.74, the pathway to the anticipated $10 remains fraught with unpredictability. As the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 suggests potential growth, savvy crypto watchers are advised to stay informed and assess the evolving market domain to pinpoint the most promising long-term investments. BlockDAG’s Sprint to $1: Is a 4200% ROI on the Horizon? BlockDAG has quickly become a powerhouse in the crypto sphere, amassing an impressive $172 million through its presale in mere months. A staggering 17.5 billion BDAG coins have been purchased, with early participants already reaping a 2,240% ROI as the price catapulted from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0234 in the latest Batch 26. This explosive growth has catapulted BlockDAG into the spotlight as the most buzzworthy crypto project currently. Enthusiasts and major players alike are drawn to its potential, especially with anticipated exchange listings that could push its value to the coveted $1 mark. Should BDAG reach this milestone, those holding Batch 26 could see a staggering 4200% ROI. Crypto analysts point to BlockDAG’s cutting-edge hybrid technology—merging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) efficiency with blockchain’s robust security—as a key driver of its presale success. This tech innovation enables faster transactions, greater scalability, and increased security, captivating a global audience and spurring a surge in demand for BDAG coins. Moreover, BlockDAG’s mining operations are thriving, generating over $6 million from the sales of more than 15,000 mining units. These units, known for their efficiency, are quickly being snapped up by those eager to maximize their BDAG earnings. As demand continues to rise, the current crypto presale for Batch 26 is poised to sell out soon, potentially driving prices higher. This presents a golden opportunity to get involved with BDAG at a still accessible price of $0.0234 per coin. Today’s Top Crypto Investment Opportunities In contrast, the PEPE price has recently fallen by 30%, stirring doubts about its future performance, while the Near Protocol price prediction for 2025 anticipates a steady rise to $10, buoyed by its sustainable technology. Yet, it’s BlockDAG that’s leading the pack in the altcoin market with its remarkable achievements and substantial presale earnings. With breakthrough DAG technology and booming mining sales, BlockDAG is on a fast track to potentially hit the $1 threshold soon, which could unlock a 4200% ROI for current Batch 26 holders. For those scouting for the best crypto to buy, seizing BDAG coins now might be the smartest move in today’s volatile market.

This Breakthrough Presale Might Be What You’re Looking For,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-vechain-this-breakthrough-presale-might-be-what-youre-looking-for/,"Cryptocurrency markets have been buzzing with innovation lately. It seems like there’s always something new on the horizon, and the possibilities seem endless. If you’ve been keeping an eye on VeChain (VET), you’re likely aware of its success in integrating blockchain technology into supply chain management and logistics. With its impressive real-world use cases, VeChain has carved out a solid niche for itself. But what if you missed out on it? What if you could invest in something that’s offering even more potential for growth? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain that’s grabbing attention for its forward-thinking approach to scalability, decentralisation, and cross-chain interoperability. The presale for Qubetics is on fire right now—having raised over $7.7 million with more than 374 million tokens sold. The price per token is set to increase by 10% as it moves into the 15th stage. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio with one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week , Qubetics could be the perfect opportunity. But why should you consider Qubetics over a well-established project like VeChain? Let’s take a deeper dive and compare the two. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Interoperability Now, let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS). This emerging Layer 1 blockchain offers a fresh take on decentralisation, scalability, and cross-chain interoperability. Unlike VeChain, which is focused primarily on supply chain applications, Qubetics provides a blockchain solution that aims to connect different ecosystems, facilitating seamless interaction between them. The project is in its 14th presale stage, with over $7.7 million raised, and it’s set to grow even more as it enters the 15th stage, which will see a 10% price increase. Qubetics is a multi-functional blockchain, offering far more than just supply chain solutions. It’s designed to provide high scalability and low-cost transactions, all while supporting decentralisation and interoperability with other blockchain networks. This means that Qubetics isn’t limited to one industry or use case—its potential spans across multiple sectors, from DeFi to NFTs and beyond. The project’s innovative cross-chain interoperability allows developers to seamlessly integrate their dApps and other projects across different blockchain ecosystems. For example, a business in India could use Qubetics to transfer assets between Ethereum and Solana, opening up a world of possibilities for cross-chain projects, which VeChain doesn’t offer at the same scale. Additionally, Qubetics’ Web3 aggregator technology provides a unified platform for users to interact with different blockchain networks, making it much easier to manage assets and applications in a decentralised manner. Qubetics also stands out for its Cross-Border Transactions, which open new doors for businesses looking to operate securely across borders. Imagine a company in Sri Lanka that needs to securely send payments and data to partners in Europe and the US without worrying about intermediaries or high fees. Qubetics’ infrastructure allows businesses to securely interact on a global scale, without the same limitations that traditional financial systems have. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Qubetics is redefining blockchain potential with its scalable, decentralised, and cross-chain interoperable infrastructure. Its ability to offer Cross-Border Transactions securely and affordably makes it one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week , especially for investors seeking growth beyond a niche market like VeChain. 2. VeChain (VET): The Supply Chain Solution VeChain (VET) has long been considered a major player in the blockchain space due to its focus on improving supply chain management. Priced at around $0.4381, VeChain’s innovative technology uses blockchain to track products across the entire supply chain, improving transparency, reducing fraud, and increasing efficiency. This use case has made it one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week for those seeking exposure to supply chain and logistics industries. VeChain’s blockchain is primarily used to provide transparency for supply chain data, allowing businesses to track products from origin to consumer. Its blockchain solution has been implemented by companies in various industries, including automotive, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods. In recent years, VeChain has expanded its reach with high-profile partnerships, including collaborations with big companies like Walmart China and BMW, further establishing its position in the supply chain space. While VeChain continues to grow and gain adoption, its reliance on a centralised model means it faces limitations in terms of decentralisation and scalability. The focus on improving supply chains is powerful, but VeChain is somewhat limited to its niche, and it doesn’t have the same level of flexibility as some other projects when it comes to integrating with multiple blockchain ecosystems. Why did VeChain make it to this list? VeChain has established itself as a leader in supply chain solutions, and its blockchain technology is being adopted by several large enterprises. For those looking to invest in a solid blockchain project with proven use cases, VeChain remains one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week, though its scope is somewhat narrow when compared to more flexible Layer 1 solutions like Qubetics. Qubetics vs. VeChain Let’s compare how an investment of $5,000 would look in both Qubetics and VeChain. With Qubetics, the price of $TICS tokens is $0.0377 at the 14th presale stage. If you invest $5,000, you would get about 132,017 tokens. Analysts predict that at the end of the presale, $TICS could reach $0.25, offering a 564% ROI. That would mean your $5,000 investment could grow to around $32,084.25. If $TICS reaches $1 after the presale, your investment would be worth $132,017, yielding a 2,555% ROI. More optimistically, if $TICS hits $5 after the presale, your $5,000 investment could reach $660,085, giving you a 13,176% ROI. The potential for high returns with Qubetics is clear, especially with its unique approach to blockchain scalability and cross-chain transactions. On the other hand, if you were to invest $5,000 in VeChain at its current price of $0.4381, you would receive about 11,418 VET tokens. While VeChain has seen solid growth, analysts are projecting more modest price increases. If VET rises to $0.50 over the next year, your $5,000 investment would grow to about $5,719, offering a 14% ROI. While VeChain is a stable investment, its price growth is expected to be slower compared to the explosive potential of Qubetics. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? The explosive growth potential of Qubetics during its presale, combined with its innovative technology and real-world applications like Cross-Border Transactions , positions it as one of the Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week. The returns from $TICS could far outpace VeChain, making it the more attractive option for investors seeking high growth. What Are The Top Altcoins to Invest in This Week? Based on our analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) is a far more versatile and high-potential investment compared to VeChain (VET). While VeChain has proven itself in the supply chain sector, Qubetics offers a much broader range of applications, from cross-chain interoperability to secure cross-border transactions, positioning it for significant growth. The ongoing presale, which has already raised over $7.7 million, provides a unique opportunity to invest in the future of blockchain technology. If you’re looking for a Top Altcoin to Invest in This Week with the potential for massive returns, Qubetics is the clear winner. With its disruptive technology and promising presale success, now is the perfect time to secure your $TICS tokens before the price increases further. Don’t miss out—join the future of blockchain and watch your investment grow.

With the momentum behind Qubetics’ presale, there’s no better time to explore the top coins with 1000x potential. 1. Qubetics: Empowering Blockchain Development as a Top Coin with 1000x Potential Qubetics ($TICS) is reshaping blockchain innovation with its game-changing QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment crafted for simplicity and efficiency.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 02:55:00

With its presale priced at $0.003, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly gaining recognition as a potential game-changer. Offering a seamless fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI has positioned itself as a frontrunner in the race to revolutionize decentralized applications. But does it have what it takes to lead the market in 2025? Rise of Lightchain AI More Than Just a Cryptocurrency Unlike a lot of digital coins that depend only on buzz or limited uses, Lightchain AI mi͏xes new tech to give real value. Its Smart Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Smarts (PoI) make it different from others, giving place for growing, smart-led apps. The AIVM acts as a new level where makers can use AI-based answers for fields such as money, health care, and supply chain work. At the same time, the PoI way keeps that the network stays power-saving and useful rewarding users for fixing AI jobs instead of old mining or betting. Can Lightchain AI Outpace Market Giants? The cryptocurrency market is dominated by heavyweights like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). However, Lightchain AI’s unique combination of AI integration and blockchain scalability positions it to compete with and possibly surpass these established players. Ethereum (ETH) While Ethereum is the go-to platform for decentralized applications, its scalability issues and high transaction fees remain persistent challenges. Lightchain AI’s advanced infrastructure could address these pain points, making it a viable alternative. Solana (SOL) Known for its speed, Solana faces concerns about decentralization and network stability. Lightchain AI, with its robust technology and sustainable consensus model, offers a more balanced solution. Ripple (XRP) Ripple focuses on cross-border payments, but Lightchain AI’s broader applications give it an edge in market diversification. Key Factors That Could Propel Lightchain AI to Market Leadership Innovative Technology Driving Adoption The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers developers to create advanced dApps, enabling industries to leverage blockchain technology in ways never seen before. This focus on utility ensures widespread adoption across sectors. Deflationary Tokenomics With its deflationary model, where a portion of transaction fees is burned, Lightchain AI ensures long-term scarcity. This mechanism incentivizes holding and increases demand, creating upward pressure on the token’s value over time. Early Investor Opportunity Priced at just $0.003 during its presale, Lightchain AI provides a rare ground-floor investment opportunity. Analysts project the token could reach $20 by 2025, representing a staggering ROI of over 600,000% for early backers. Why 2025 Could Be the Year of Lightchain AI As the blockchain and AI industries continue to expand, Lightchain AI’s positioning at the intersection of these technologies gives it a significant advantage. With a strong roadmap that includes the mainnet launch and strategic partnerships, the project is well-equipped to capture market share. Moreover, the growing demand for decentralized, AI-powered solutions across industries could catapult Lightchain AI into the spotlight, making it a household name in the cryptocurrency space. Plus, with the global push towards sustainability and energy efficiency, Lightchain AI’s unique Proof of Intelligence consensus mechanism could attract environmentally-conscious investors and further drive adoption.

Yep, it’s BTFD Coin, an exciting newcomer that’s out to shake up the meme coin space! Alongside familiar faces like Baby Doge and SPX6900, BTFD Coin is gaining attention with its buzzworthy presale success and juicy 50% festive discount. If you’re looking to cash in on the best new meme coins for massive return potential, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s get this party started, shall we? Now, let’s talk numbers, because what we’re really after is serious gains—and the numbers behind BTFD Coin are looking pretty darn spectacular. We’re in Stage 12 of the presale, with over $4.44 million raised in record time (seriously, under 14 days to hit $2.5 million? That’s impressive). And if you’re looking for a deal, hold onto your hats: BIG50 is the code that unlocks a 50% discount on your BTFD purchase. Take a moment to absorb that: a 50% festive discount on an already hot presale. Did someone say “opportunity”? Yes, yes they did. Let’s dive into the features of BTFD Coin and how it’s designed to bring in massive returns. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Making Waves First things first—why is BTFD Coin so special? Well, if you’re in the crypto space, you’ve probably heard of the BTFD mindset, which stands for “Buy The Dip.” If you’re wondering what this has to do with anything, it’s the core philosophy of the BTFD Coin community. Inspired by the chaos of the 1973 market crash, BTFD Coin offers a unique proposition: seize opportunities during market downturns just like smart investors did back then, cashing in some huge gains. As a result, Stage 7 is the perfect moment to get more $BTFD at a reduced price, giving investors a big edge. Now, let’s talk about the big picture: BTFD Coin’s presale success isn’t just about hype—it’s a combination of powerful tokenomics, a high-APY staking program , and a P2E game that’s ready to blow up. With Stage 12 currently in play, the BTFD Coin presale is over halfway to its final goal, and over 58 billion $BTFD coins have already been sold. If that doesn’t scream massive return potential, I don’t know what does. So, what does that actually mean in terms of gains? Let’s say you dropped $57,000 into BTFD Coin at today’s price of $0.000064 per coin. Here’s the math: at that price, you’d be picking up 890,625,000 $BTFD coins. If the price increases to the presale target of $0.0006 per coin, that $57,000 investment could potentially balloon into $534,375—talk about serious gains! With the BIG50 festive discount, this scenario isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem! Baby Doge: A Meme Coin with Heart Now, let’s shift gears a bit and talk about Baby Doge. This little pupper is making waves on the BNB chain, and it’s hard to ignore the adorable face of the coin. Originally created as a joke (hey, aren’t all the best things born this way?), Baby Doge has evolved into a community powerhouse that spreads awareness for animal adoption. But beyond being a cute mascot, Baby Doge is a meme coin with some real utility—like its AI image generator and NFT capabilities, which let users create their own Baby Doge characters and images. In addition to its community-driven mission, Baby Doge is also helping real animals. The coin’s record-breaking donations have provided over 81,000 pounds of dog food to pups in need. If you’re into coins with a cause, Baby Doge definitely checks that box. As for the investment potential, Baby Doge has a large circulating supply of 161,680,749,827,200,480 BABYDOGE coins, with a market cap hovering around $583 million. SPX6900: The Blockchain Token That’s All About Innovation And then we have SPX6900—a meme coin bringing a fresh approach to the blockchain space. Unlike the others, SPX6900 isn’t just focused on memes—it’s leveraging advanced cryptography and promising limitless applications. As the name suggests, SPX6900 is all about going big or going home. With its powerful blockchain capabilities, SPX6900 is eyeing scientific and technological fields for its future growth. The token’s price has been rising steadily, currently sitting at $0.771778 with a 24-hour trading volume of $47 million. Ranked at #127 on CoinMarketCap, SPX6900’s market cap of $718 million suggests there’s room for growth, especially if the project’s innovative blockchain solutions gain traction. The circulating supply stands at 930,993,090 SPX tokens, with a total max supply of 1 billion tokens. How to Claim Your BTFD Coins and Unlock the BIG50 Code Start by going to the Presale Page , then follow these simple steps: Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code: Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50 , and click “Apply”. Enter Purchase Details: Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Still Has A High Greed Value The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing this mentality. Its value being greater than 53 means the investors as a whole are showing greed, while it being under 47 implies the presence of fear in the market. Values lying between these cutoffs correspond to a net neutral sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Giving Potential Buy Signal, Quant Says Now, here is how the current sentiment in the sector looks according to the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 73 at the moment, which suggests the average trader is holding a sentiment of greed. This greed sentiment is also a particularly strong one, so strong in fact that it’s sitting very close to a special region called the extreme greed. The extreme greed occurs when the index reaches a value of 75 or higher. A similar zone also exists for the fear side, known as the extreme fear, and is situated at 25 or under. Historically, the extreme sentiments have proven to be important for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as tops and bottoms have tended to occur while the market has been inside these zones. The relationship between price and sentiment has generally been an inverse one, meaning extreme greed leads to tops and extreme fear to bottoms. The BTC top earlier in the month occurred when the index was at a value of 87. With the price decline that has occurred since then, market sentiment has cooled off a bit. The question is: has it cooled enough? While other phases of the market usually require dips into fear or extreme fear for bottoms to take place, bull markets generally don’t see pullbacks that deep. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment Often times, a venture into the normal greed zone or the neutral territory is enough for the price to regain steam. That said, the recent sentiment has still been quite close to extreme greed, so it may need a bit more before a real turnaround is reached. The Fear & Greed Index calculates its value using multiple factors, one of which is social media sentiment. While the overall sentiment has still been positive, it seems social media users have started to show fear, as the analytics firm Santiment has pointed out in an X post.

ETH is now recovering some losses and might rise if it clears the $3,550 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,350 zone. The price is trading above $3,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,425 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent increase if it clears the $3,520 and $3,550 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum price remained stable above $3,220 and started a recovery wave like Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $3,350 and $3,400 resistance levels. The price even cleared the $3,500 resistance level. However, the bears remained active below the $3,550 level. A high was formed at $3,534 and the price is now consolidating gains. It corrected some points below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $3,226 swing low to the $3,534 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,425 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,520 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,540 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,550. A clear move above the $3,550 resistance might send the price toward the $3,650 resistance. An upside break above the $3,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,720 resistance zone or even $3,800. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,550 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,425 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,375 zone. A clear move below the $3,375 support might push the price toward the $3,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,110. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Currently, only 53% of SHIB holders are reporting profitable positions, reflecting broader concerns about the asset’s performance and market dynamics. Declining Investor Activity and Profitability Profitability metrics highlight SHIB’s struggles in maintaining investor confidence. A significant factor in its recent downturn is the reduced activity among large investors. Over the past week, the number of substantial transactions has dropped by 60.9%, signaling reduced participation from whales and institutions—key players that often drive significant price movements. The asset’s reliance on a concentrated group of holders exacerbates its vulnerability to market fluctuations. Notably, 73% of SHIB’s total supply remains under the control of major players, further amplifying its susceptibility to large price swings. Key Support and Resistance Levels The token’s price has declined significantly from its previous highs and is now trading near its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a critical support zone. A breach of this level could lead to further declines, potentially testing the 200-day EMA. On the upside, the $0.000023 resistance level remains a crucial benchmark for any potential recovery. However, given the current market sentiment, a breakout above this resistance appears unlikely in the short term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Network Growth and Community Engagement A concerning trend for SHIB is the slowdown in its network growth, with fewer new wallet activations observed. This decline suggests diminishing interest from new investors, a critical factor for sustaining momentum in a speculative market like SHIB. Additionally, metrics from the asset’s Telegram community indicate reduced engagement, pointing to waning enthusiasm among existing supporters. A shift in market sentiment is essential for the asset to regain its footing. This could come in the form of renewed whale activity, a substantial increase in network growth, or a successful breach of critical resistance levels. Until these conditions materialize, cautious optimism may be the best approach for current investors. Key price levels to monitor include the $0.000020 support and the $0.000023 resistance. These zones will likely play a significant role in determining the token’s near-term trajectory. Investors should remain vigilant and assess broader market conditions before making important decisions. The token’s ability to recover will depend on reversing the negative trends in investor activity, community engagement, and network expansion. Without these improvements, the asset’s challenges may persist, limiting its potential for a significant rebound.

The United States Department of Justice announced that the pair face charges including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and stalking. According to prosecutors, Hay and Mayo promoted various NFT and digital asset projects, providing misleading roadmaps and making “materially false and misleading statements” about their intentions to fulfill project promises. One such project, Vault of Gems, was marketed as the first NFT project “pegged to a hard asset.” However, prosecutors claim the duo abandoned the initiative after collecting millions from investors. Principal Deputy Attorney General Nicole Argentieri stated: “Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo allegedly defrauded investors in digital asset projects of tens of millions of dollars and threatened an individual who attempted to expose their roles in these fraudulent schemes.” When a project manager revealed their involvement in another NFT project, Faceless, Hay and Mayo allegedly resorted to harassment and intimidation, targeting the individual and their family. The Justice Department revealed that the duo used similar tactics across multiple projects, including Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Dirty Dogs, MoonPortal, and Squiggles. To obscure their involvement, they reportedly misrepresented others as the project owners. Argentieri emphasized the Justice Department’s commitment to combating digital asset fraud, saying: “Fraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors’ hard-earned money.” Officials vowed to work with law enforcement to uproot crypto fraud schemes and protect investors.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Metaverse|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 03:58:00
33767162,[object Object],1735099217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Litecoin’s Quiet Growth: Average Active Users Jumped 10% In 2024,https://bitcoinist.com/litecoins-growth-average-active-jumped-10-2024/,"On-chain data shows the Litecoin Daily Active Addresses indicator has seen a significant increase this year as compared to the last one. Litecoin Average Active Addresses Have Been Notably Higher This Year In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the year-on-year growth in the Daily Active Addresses for Litecoin. The “ Daily Active Addresses ” refers to a metric that measures the total number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the network every day. When the value of this indicator goes up, it means the unique number of addresses making transfers on the blockchain is rising. As the unique number of addresses can be equated with the unique number of users, this kind of trend implies traffic on the chain is increasing. On the other hand, the metric registering a decline suggests investor interest in the cryptocurrency may be waning as not many users are participating in on-chain activity. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Litecoin Daily Active Addresses over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Litecoin Daily Active Addresses started 2024 very strongly, but the metric cooled off soon after. There have been some bursts of activity since then, but on the whole, the indicator has shown a consistent sideways trajectory. On average, there have been around 401,000 addresses interacting on the blockchain every day this year. While this is significantly lower than the massive 1.37 million high from January where LTC surpassed both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), it’s still almost 10% higher than the 366,000 average from 2023. Historically, Litecoin has generally tended to do well in terms of activity-related metrics, due to the fact that the network offers cheap and fast transactions. The traffic growth that LTC has witnessed compared to the previous year would imply users are still being attracted to the chain for its use as a mode of payments. Recently, the miners have also been investing into the network, as the total LTC hashrate , a measure of the miners’ computing power, has been on the rise. Below is a chart from CoinWarz that displays this trend. Growth in the Daily Active Addresses is usually constructive for any cryptocurrency, as it means that there is rising interest in the network, which can potentially help fuel price moves. LTC hasn’t exactly been doing the best in terms of price action lately, but the strong traffic and miner confidence may help it reverse course. LTC Price Litecoin had plunged toward the $86 mark at the end of last week, but it appears the coin has seen a jump since then as its price is now trading around $110.",Litecoin News|litecoin|Litecoin Active Addresses|Litecoin Activity|Litecoin Growth|LTC|LTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-25 04:00:17

The crypto has caught the eyes of investors lately, especially after the crypto market witnessed volatile trading after the latest US FOMC. However, despite the volatile trading, SHIB on-chain metrics indicate a bullish momentum ahead for the crypto. Shiba Inu News: SHIB On-Chain Metrics Hints At Breakout Ahead The investors are keeping close track of Shiba Inu news, especially as the crypto has recorded a surge of over 6% today. Notably, the top meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and others have recorded massive volatility over the past few days, amid a broader crypto market crash. However, the recent performance indicates that the investors are regaining confidence in the risk-bet assets after a recent pause. Meanwhile, the SHIB on-chain metrics also indicate a hovering bullish momentum in the market. According to Santiment data, the Shiba Inu exchange supply declined significantly, indicating that funds are flowing out of the top crypto exchanges . Notably, the declining exchange supply indicates that investors are moving out funds from exchanges, which in turn could significantly boost the asset’s price. Source: Santiment On the other hand, the whale activity also noted a significant increase recently, indicating a bullish momentum ahead. Santiment data showed that whale transactions have noted a robust surge recently, after muted activity over the past few weeks. Source: Santiment Considering all these aspects, the future of the top dog-themed meme coin looks promising. So, let’s explore how the SHIB price is performing and how the meme coin might perform in the coming days. SHIB Breakout Ahead? The positive Shiba Inu news, especially the on-chain metrics, appeared to have boosted the market confidence. SHIB price today was up more than 6% and exchanged hands at $0.00002284, while its one-day trading volume dropped 9% to $610 million. Furthermore, Shiba Inu Futures Open Interest jumped nearly 10%, indicating a bullish market momentum. Amid this, the recent technical Shiba Inu price chart indicates a breakout ahead. For context, the inverse head and shoulder pattern indicates that the crypto could hit $0.000035 in the near term. Once this target is achieved, the crypto will rally to about $0.000045 ahead. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, a recent SHIB price analysis also indicates that the crypto could hit the $0.000035 mark in the near term. Considering all these positive trends of the coin, it appears that SHIB is gearing up for a breakout soon.

Musk the Manipulator (MUSKMANI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKMANI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk the Manipulator can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk the Manipulator could become the next viral memecoin. Musk the Manipulator launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk the Manipulator on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk the Manipulator by entering its contract address – DZpfk5LaLrnP6vSFJnLSMAopUuTJGiFk7543rQxh4ids – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKMANI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 04:23:00

Issued at the request of Finnish authorities, it follows allegations of tax fraud and assault in the country. Tax Fraud and Assault Charges The Red Notice is a formal request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal actions. However, it does not constitute an international arrest warrant. Earlier this year, Heart was also featured on the European Union’s Most Wanted List for the same charges. Finnish authorities allege that he committed tax fraud between 2020 and 2024, with a remand order first issued against him on September 13, 2024. “For the purpose of avoiding tax, Schueler failed to observe a statutory duty pertaining to taxation that is of significance in the assessment of tax,” read the tax fraud allegation. The authorities claim that the 45-year-old failed to file business tax returns for multiple years and omitted information about his income in pre-filled personal returns. They allege that he received income from business activities that should have been declared to the tax administration for assessment, with the total amount of dues avoided reaching hundreds of millions of euros. In a separate case, Schueler is also wanted in Finland for allegedly assaulting a minor. Schueler Defends Legacy Amid Interpol Notice While the accused has not directly addressed the Red Notice, in a December 22 post on X, he seemed to reference the situation indirectly, challenging his ‘haters’ and highlighting his philanthropic efforts. “Why settle for being wanted when you can be the most wanted?” read the post, referencing his claimed $27 million contributions to medical research, self-help books, and P2P publishing software. He emphasized his belief in his positive impact, expressing that he strives to ‘make the world a better place’ despite feeling that those who make a difference often face unkindness. Meanwhile, the Hex creator is also involved in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2023, the regulator sued him, accusing him of unregistered securities sales and fraudulent activities. The agency alleges that Heart conducted an unsanctioned sale of cryptocurrency securities that raised over $1 billion. He is accused of promoting Hex as a “blockchain certificate of deposit” between December 2019 and November 2020. Further, he is said to have promised high returns and attracted $678 million in investments, but the token’s value later dropped by 98.4% from its peak. The SEC also claims Heart raised $354 million for PulseChain, supposedly for development, but used the funds for personal luxuries. In January 2024, he filed a motion to dismiss the case, which the financial watchdog opposed, arguing it failed to address the allegations or meet legal standards.

How Remittix (RTX) Is Transforming Finance With PayFi,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cross-border-payments-using-crypto-how-remittix-rtx-is-transforming-finance-with-payfi/,"The demand for flawless and quick cross-border payment solutions has never been more evident in a time when financial institutions are becoming ever more digital. With its creative PayFi technology, Remittix (RTX) is leading the way in enhancing this industry and closing the gap between cryptocurrencies and conventional fiat systems. This innovative method lets individuals and companies transmit crypto-to-fiat payments all around the globe, therefore releasing the full potential of digital currencies in regular financial operations. Remittix has been identified as the best crypto investment of the year because of how it is revolutionizing cross-border payments with its safe, reasonably priced, transparent platform, providing a smarter substitute for conventional banking institutions. The Need for Practical Payment Solutions Cryptocurrencies have become more and more popular as the world’s economy fast turns toward digitization. Though the creative uses of cryptos are great, their capacity to interact with conventional monetary systems still lags greatly, therefore restricting the potential of cryptos for regular people and companies. Here Remittix finds value in providing innovative infrastructure meant to close the distance between digital currencies and the conventional banking system. As a result, investors seeking long-term returns are accumulating RTX, the utility token for the Remittix ecosystem and one of the best cryptos to buy now . Given the over $3.2 trillion worth of cryptocurrencies today, the need for sensible, safe, quick payment methods has never been stronger. Particularly in cross-border payments, cryptocurrencies are considered a quick substitute for conventional banking systems. Still, their interaction with fiat systems presents a difficulty, sometimes keeping users from fully appreciating the advantages of embracing cryptocurrencies. Remittix exists to correct that. The Crypto-to-Fiat On/Off-Ramp Market: A Crucial Bridge Bridging the distance between the cryptocurrency ecosystem and conventional financial institutions depends on the crypto-to-fiat on/off-ramp market. While off-ramps let users cash out their crypto holdings into fiat, on-ramps let them turn fiat money into cryptocurrencies. As acceptance of cryptocurrencies worldwide quickens, demand for these services is rising. The market for crypto payment gateways is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% from 2024 to 2032; it was valued at $1.2 billion in 2023 . Remittix is the best crypto investment now as it is set to take a sizable portion of this expanding market while cryptocurrencies get more included in regular corporate activities. Remittix is establishing itself as a pioneer in cross-border payments by providing a safe and quick way to turn more than forty cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies. Transforming the Cross-Border Payments Sector The global economy depends much on cross-border payments. They assist trade, investment, and the flow of capital and people by allowing money to be internationally exchanged. From about $150 trillion in 2017 to over $250 trillion by 2027 , cross-border payments’ value is predicted to rise, hence underlining the need for reliable and safe payment systems. But especially in underdeveloped areas, conventional cross-border payment systems may suffer from exorbitant costs, poor processing times, and limited access to financial services. Remittix provides a more affordable, quick, and safe substitute to meet these difficulties. Remittix lets users rapidly convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies using blockchain technology and local payment networks, therefore avoiding hidden fees or difficult processes. Remittix guarantees that users get a better deal by offering flat, clear rates unlike conventional banks, who charge hefty foreign exchange (FX) fees and wire transfer costs. What you send is exactly what the recipient receives. Remittix’s strategy is based on simplicity and openness, which makes it the perfect answer for companies and people wishing to transmit cross-border payments free from the complexity of conventional banking systems. Remittix: Empowering Businesses and Consumers Remittix is transforming cross-border personal payments as well as enabling companies that want to take crypto payments. Companies can now take crypto payments via the Remittix Pay API and settle them in fiat straight to a selected bank account. This creates fresh chances for businesses to use the expanding crypto market while avoiding the complexity and volatility sometimes linked with crypto transactions. Using Remittix, businesses may also create a merchant account, granting them complete control over how they pay their cryptocurrency. Remittix offers the flexibility and simplicity required to easily handle payments whether one wants to turn their assets into any of over 30 fiat currencies or more than 50 different cryptocurrencies. Remittix is a must-have tool for companies trying to keep ahead of the curve in a fast-changing financial scene since crypto payments fit well into the conventional financial ecosystem. The Remittix Presale: A Golden Opportunity for Investors Remittix is one of the best cryptos to buy now as it promises huge ROIs for investors while it keeps extending its products and offerings. Right now in presale is the RTX token, which runs the Remittix ecosystem. At approximately $0.0156 , each RTX token is an appealing investment choice for individuals wishing to profit from the expansion of the crypto-to-fiat transfers sector. RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in because of the rapidly increasing demand for fast and efficient cross-border payment solutions. Just a few weeks have seen more than 20 million RTX tokens sold, proving the great investor demand. Analysts estimate that before the presale concludes, RTX token value could rise by 500% given the limited presale token supply and fast escalating investor demand. Hence, RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in while the presale is still ongoing. Some analysts project a possible 50x surge in the value of the RTX token during the ongoing bull run following the debut next year. Meanwhile, over $375,000 has been raised already in a matter of days and analysts expect this value to hit $500,000 by the end of the week. Remittix has also passed a SOLIDProof audit without any problems, therefore confirming the platform’s dedication to client confidence, openness, and security.

Remarkably, Bitcoin was the best-performing investment of 2024, rising by 140% in just 12 months. Bitcoin skyrocketed to a record high of $108,000 in December. Notably, several events led to Bitcoin’s growth. The first BTC ETF was approved in January which turned out to be very successful attracting huge inflows. Further, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his very anticipated November win in the US Presidential elections further fueled Bitcoin’s price. Besides, Trump’s pick of Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair has further boosted the expectations of favorable regulations in the crypto community. The Impact Of Influential Figures The crypto world is largely shaped by influential figures with their actions and views largely impacting the market dynamics. Prominent personalities like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Brad Garlinghouse, among others, are contributing to a more favorable setting for innovation and growth in the crypto space. Let us dive deeper to know who were the 10 most influential figures in crypto this year. 1. Donald Trump – Former President of the United States, crypto advocate. The President-elect Donald Trump endorsed pro-crypto policies during his presidential campaign and enabled fundraising for his inauguration via cryptocurrency donations. He also promised to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve in his second term. The Trump campaign also accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he appeared at industry events, promising to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet”. He also promised to create a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council. He has boosted the market confidence by signaling a pro-crypto regulatory stance, which led to increased adoption and investments. 2. Elon Musk – CEO of SpaceX, Tesla Elon Musk has frequently backed cryptocurrencies through his X posts. In 2021, Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and also planned to accept the coin as payment for its product and services. According to Bloomberg reports , the tech billionaire was also the largest political donor in the country, as he spent at least $270 million to support Donald Trump’s bid for the US presidency. Trump has also selected Musk to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk occasionally speaks on other altcoins, but he generally speaks of Bitcoin and dogecoin in his public commentaries. Musk’s influence on crypto remains beyond comparison which also reflects how a person can ignite global discussions and shift market dynamics. 3. Brad Garlinghouse – Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple has been an influential voice in the cryptocurrency space. He has oftentimes stressed the importance of clear and fair regulation for cryptocurrencies and has been vocal about the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. SEC. He also expressed excitement when Trump chose Paul Atkins to be the next SEC Chair stating that he will bring common sense back to the agency. Besides, Garlinghouse has described the recent US election as a turning point for the crypto industry noting the impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s surprising shift toward a pro-crypto stance during the campaign. “I think it’s clear that Donald Trump embraced crypto and crypto embraced Donald Trump,” he stated. 4. Michael Saylor – Microstrategy’s Chairman Recently, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor has emerged as one of the biggest supporters of the crypto realm. Saylor is known for his vocal support of Bitcoin and his company’s substantial Bitcoin holdings. He has expressed strong backing for Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor recently presented a three-minute pitch to Microsoft’s board of directors, urging them to consider buying Bitcoin. He told Microsoft’s board of directors that Bitcoin could be a force multiplier for the company’s balance sheet, and its valuation.“Microsoft has a choice to make: Cling to the past or embrace the future,” he said. However, Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal for the company to possibly buy Bitcoin. 5. Cynthia Lummis – US Senator US Senator Cynthia Lummis had proposed the idea of creating a Bitcoin national reserve. She had also suggested that the US government could sell some Federal Reserve’s Gold to fund the Bitcoin purchase. She has called 2025 a critical year for Bitcoin and crypto, as major government positions and proposed policies are expected to line up and bring about significant changes in the sector. She has also remarked that with David Sacks as Crypto Czar, this will be the most pro-digital asset administration ever. 5. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO Back in 2017, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink had said that Bitcoin was “an index of money laundering,” arguing that the cryptocurrency primarily reflects how much money is being made from criminal activity, he now believes that Bitcoin is an asset class in itself and is an alternative to other commodities like gold. While Fink admitted to being a proud Bitcoin skeptic earlier, after exploring more about it, he concluded that his previous opinion held for five years, was wrong. Remarkably, Fink’s BlackRock has turned out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the post election surge in Bitcoin. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) has swelled by $13 billion since Trump’s win on Nov. 5, pushing iShares Bitcoin Trust past $40 billion in assets just 10 months following its launch. 7. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan is an entrepreneur and innovator in the blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Shayne is the CEO of Polymarket, which is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can trade on the outcomes of world events using blockchain. This year, Polymarket arosef the most fascinating and potentially valuable use cases in the growing crypto industry. As the 2024 U.S. presidential race developed, it attracted many new users who successfully predicted important events, like Biden’s withdrawal and Trump’s win. 8. Vivekramaswamy – American Biotech Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate, has been selected by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency alongside Elon Musk. Musk and Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, aimed to improve governance and cut down on wasteful expenditures. Ramaswamy, an active advisor in former President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, has consistently voiced strong support for Bitcoin. He views it as a robust alternative to the US dollar, highlighting its role in holding the Federal Reserve accountable and preventing currency manipulation. He spoke at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville earlier this year, where Trump promised to turn America into a “Bitcoin superpower.” Prior to that, he had noted that he would implement a “comprehensive crypto policy framework” if elected commander-in-chief. 9. John Deaton – Legal Advocate John Deaton, a renowned crypto lawyer and legal advocate, has been widely praised for his role in the Ripple (XRP) case. He has been skeptical about Gary Gensler as well who he belives to be stifling innovation in crypto and has endorsed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. In a recent YouTube interview with the Good Morning Crypto podcast Deaton had noted that the SEC’s handling of cryptocurrency regulation in the Ripple lawsuit led to nearly $15 billion in losses for small crypto investors. Founder of the law firm Deaton Law Firm, he has become a well-known figure within the crypto community for his efforts to protect the rights of retail investors and push back against regulatory actions he believes could harm the industry. 10. Paul Atkins – Former SEC Commissioner President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to run the SEC, Paul Atkins, is the leader the crypto industry wanted. Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a “proven leader for common sense regulations.” In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. Conclusion These prominent figures are creating a unique collaboration between politics, business, and technology which could entirely transform the crypto landscape. With the incoming pro-crypto administration, with Paul Atkins all set to be the next SEC Chair, and advocates like John Deaton raising their voices for clearer crypto regulations, the crypto industry is all set to witness a whole new era of growth and innovation.",Top 10s in Crypto Market,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 04:47:51

DeFi Platforms Show Better Security Mechanisms In its annual “Web3 Security Report,” Hacken outlined the general trends in the cryptocurrency industry with regard to scams and security infrastructure. The report notes that total losses arising from security failure in 2024 stood at $2.91 billion.

DeFi protocols accounted for $474 million in losses this year, a 40% decline from $787 million in 2023. This sharp drop reflects the growing adoption of advanced security techniques, such as zero-knowledge cryptography and multi-party computation, across the DeFi ecosystem. One key factor contributing to the reduction in DeFi exploits was the sharp decline in cross-chain bridge hacks. Losses from these attacks have consistently fallen – from $1.89 billion in 2022 to $338 million in 2023, and finally to $114 million in 2024. In contrast, CeFi platforms, including cryptocurrency exchanges, reported $694 million in losses in 2024, more than double the $339 million recorded in 2023. CeFi accounted for nearly one-third of all crypto-related incidents, highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in centralized systems. Gaming and metaverse projects were another major target in 2024, responsible for nearly 20% of all crypto-related hacks, with $389 million in losses. The largest gaming/metaverse breach of the year was the PlayDapp exploit in Q1 2024, which resulted in a $290 million loss. Phishing scams also remained a significant concern, causing more than $600 million in losses this year. These scams highlight increasingly sophisticated social engineering tactics in the Web3 space. In November, the sector faced a $129 million address poisoning attack. For context, address poisoning phishing involves attackers sending small transactions from an address that closely resembles one the victim has interacted with, tricking them into mistakenly sending funds to the fraudulent address in future transactions. Memecoins And Rugpulls Continue To Prey On Users While memecoins were all the rage for the majority of 2024 – particularly on the Solana (SOL) blockchain due to its low transaction costs – a significant proportion of them preyed on investors through presale scams and celebrity-endorsed rug pulls. Related Reading: Dogecoin & Other Memecoins No Longer Grabbing Social Media Attention: Santiment One notable example is the Hawk Tuah memecoin, launched by viral influencer Hailey Welch, popularly known as “Hawk Tuah Girl”. The coin’s value plummeted 95% shortly after launch, sparking severe backlash from the wider Web3 community. The rise in memecoin-related scams also underscores the need for greater investor education, particularly when engaging with such speculative assets.

Table of Contents Solana powerhouse in blockchain and DeFi Dogecoin still relevant in the meme coin arena New contender Lightchain AI The future of altcoins and why Lightchain AI may lead the pack As the cryptocurrency market approaches 2025, Solana (SOL) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and the rising altcoin Lightchain AI (LCAI) are drawing serious attention from investors. While Solana continues to dominate the blockchain space and Dogecoin holds its ground in the meme coin market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a potential game-changer. Investors are buzzing about its explosive growth potential, particularly with the Lightchain AI presale , which is creating a unique opportunity to get in early on this promising token. Analysts are even predicting a jaw-dropping 30,000% rally for LCAI, which could surpass both Solana and Dogecoin in the coming months. Let’s dive into what makes these three coins stand out and why Lightchain AI might just steal the spotlight. You might also like: Cardano and Toncoin take a backseat as Lightchain AI presale shines Solana powerhouse in blockchain and DeFi Solana has emerged as a leading blockchain platform, renowned for its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it a preferred choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its unique combination of proof-of-history and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms enables the network to process thousands of transactions per second, significantly outpacing many competitors. As of December 23, 2024, Solana’s price is approximately $180.80, reflecting a slight increase of 0.31% over the previous close. The platform has experienced substantial growth, with its market capitalization reaching over $86 billion. Recent developments include the introduction of Solana Pay, a payment processing system that allows merchants to accept payments in SOL, further expanding its ecosystem. Analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s future, with some predicting significant price increases by 2025, driven by its technological advancements and growing adoption in the DeFi and NFT sectors. Dogecoin still relevant in the meme coin arena Dogecoin, the original meme cryptocurrency, continues to maintain its relevance in the crypto market. As of December 23, 2024, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.31, reflecting a slight decrease of 1.91% from the previous close. The intraday high reached $0.32, with a low of $0.31. Recent developments have significantly impacted Dogecoin’s market performance. Notably, President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement of the “Department of Government Efficiency”, to be led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, resulted in a substantial surge in DOGE’s value. Following the announcement, Dogecoin’s price increased by nearly 20%, trading at $0.42 and achieving a market capitalization of nearly $60 billion. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, with some predicting a potential rise to $0.50 by 2025, driven by its growing acceptance and community support. New contender Lightchain AI Lightchain AI , a new token in the meme coin space, is gaining attention for its potential 30,000% rally. Combining elements of meme coin culture with blockchain technology, LCAI offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward assets. The coin’s unique tokenomics provide unique incentives for holders, including rewards tied to staking and community participation. Lightchain AI also benefits from viral marketing, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with growing community enthusiasm driving interest. Strategic partnerships and upcoming DeFi integrations further add to its appeal. If LCAI continues on its current trajectory, it could achieve 30,000% gains, potentially reaching a price of $3 by the end of 2025, outperforming both Solana and Dogecoin. The future of altcoins and why Lightchain AI may lead the pack As we approach 2025, cryptocurrencies like Solana, Dogecoin, and Dogen are poised to benefit from the increasing interest in altcoins. While Solana continues to dominate the blockchain space and Dogecoin remains a popular meme coin, Lightchain AI is emerging as a major contender with its immense growth potential and unique features. Lightchain AI combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, addressing critical challenges in scalability, privacy, and governance. With its low presale price of $0.003, LCAI offers a unique opportunity for early investors to gain exposure to its anticipated growth. As the 2025 altcoin season kicks off, Lightchain AI stands out as a potential leader, poised to deliver life-changing returns for those who get in early. Keep a close watch on LCAI as it prepares to change the crypto space. To learn more about Lightchain AI, visit the website , whitepaper, X , and Telegram.

RCO Finance set to disrupt DeFi landscape with AI-Powered tools Making institutional investment accessible for everyone Conclusion As the year draws to an end, the XRP price is making news, approaching its all-time high of $3.40, a mark it attained nearly seven years ago. Analysts are now hopeful about the token’s prospects, with an almost 300% rise year-to-date that positions the fourth-largest cryptocurrency for new records. XRP to reach $5 on Christmas Day? After a recent major decline of 9% in the last two weeks, the XRP price has increased by 3.4% to $2.25 within just 24 hours, ending the week above essential support levels. This recovery sets the XRP price to maintain its remarkable upward trend, having increased more than 100% since November 5, aligning with the political changes in the United States. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez emphasized the significance of the $2.20 support level, stating that as long as the XRP price holds above this mark, it could consolidate prior to aiming for the $2.70 resistance. The analyst thinks that if the XRP price falls below $2.20, it might lead to a drop to $1.96. Martinez also observed an increase in whale activity, with major acquisitions of 80 million tokens since December 17, indicating positive sentiment for XRP. Notably, in a recent poll conducted by market analyst CryptoinsightUK on social media site X (formerly Twitter), a majority of respondents anticipated the XRP price would reclaim the $3.30 level by Christmas day. However, the analyst projected a possible new all-time high of $5 for the XRP price by December 24, with bold expectations of hitting $10 and more from January to March 2025. In the midst of these optimistic predictions for the XRP price, a new contender is rising in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space: RCO Finance. Scheduled for launch in 2025, the platform’s native token RCOF will introduce a range of cutting-edge products and tools, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to present investors with distinct chances to grow their portfolios and improve capital returns. RCO Finance set to disrupt DeFi landscape with AI-Powered tools In contrast to XRP, which fulfills particular use cases like cross-border payments and gas fee transactions on the XRP Ledger, RCO Finance seeks to make advanced investment strategies accessible to everyone. The platform provides tailored investment strategies, extensive asset availability, a KYC-free financial environment, AI-driven market modifications, and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). RCO Finance’s no-code automated tool allows users, irrespective of their financial expertise, to improve their investments without depending on brokers or intermediaries. This convenient accessibility particularly appeals to new investors looking to capitalize on market trends, which amid the current bullish cycle, provides a crucial opportunity for further portfolio growth. Interestingly, the platform also provides access to an extensive selection of more than 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 categories, featuring conventional investments such as stocks and bonds, alongside digital assets and tokenized real-world items. Making institutional investment accessible for everyone A notable aspect of RCO Finance is its know-you-customer (KYC)-free environment, which emphasizes user privacy and removes lengthy identity verification procedures. This aspect is especially appealing to investors who prioritize anonymity and want to participate in decentralized finance without the usual onboarding challenges. The platform’s AI technology also offers immediate portfolio modifications in response to market changes and user activity, allowing traders to take advantage of new trends without needing to monitor constantly, a vital benefit during unstable market situations. Yet, one of the most appealing tools for investors is the platform’s capacity to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), enabling users to invest in products such as real estate and commodities via blockchain tokens. This fractional ownership model opens up markets that were previously inaccessible to regular traders and reserved for institutions, enabling investors to participate without needing a large amount of capital. Conclusion Overall, RCO Finance is poised to tap into several growth trends intersecting crypto and AI, offering a comprehensive suite of tools that present a unique opportunity for investors. While the XRP price is forecasted to surge, RCO Finance distinguishes itself with its innovative offerings. Currently, the RCOF token is valued at $0.077 in its fourth presale stage, with predictions suggesting it could rise to $0.214 in the next bonus round, representing a nearly 200% return for early investors to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity.

AI Crypto Investors Now Shifting Focus to Lunex’s Huge Potential,https://timestabloid.com/theta-and-tao-deliver-big-returns-ai-crypto-investors-now-shifting/,"While meme coins remain volatile in the crypto market, AI cryptos like TAO and Theta have delivered outstanding returns. Despite TAO and Theta’s token prices ‘ excellent performance, AI crypto investors are beginning to diversify to Lunex Network following its impressively loud presale.

Santiment’s data suggests that Theta positivity surged to 0.7, up from a low of -0.1.

Demand surge in Theta is also backed by raising trading activities to $682 million and Futures Open Interest spiking to an all-time high of $112 million. This suggests that Theta investors are holding their existing positions, and new ones are joining. TAO strengthens its position as one of the best AI cryptos While Bittensor ( TAO ) is not exploding at an enormous rate like Theta’s token price , it’s growing rapidly and is on course to equal its all-time high.

This is exactly what a newly launched crypto token did: it surged 5,500% despite the crypto market crash and made millions for a crypto trader. Crypto Trader Made $3.25M in Profits After Investing in UFD Crypto trading is an intricate investment process that requires multiple strategies, correct timing, identifying opportunities, and much more to earn significant profits. However, there are incidents where traders have heavy returns in a finger snap. And this is what this crypto trader did, as he invested $90 in a newly launched Solana meme coin and earned $3.25M in profits after the token skyrocketed 5,500%. Lookonchain, a famous crypto page, revealed this incident, in which the trader earned 36,067x returns over his UFD investment. More importantly, this happened within two days, leaving the netizens in shock. However, this is nothing new; investors have made such significant returns multiple times, including a crypto whale that earned 5M from the PENGU airdrop. What can $90 get you? This trader turned $90 into $3.25M in just 2 days by buying $UFD—an insane 36,067x return! #UFD https://t.co/wLEWwVnYAR pic.twitter.com/T1qs1Q7m1a — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 19, 2024 What is Unicorn Fart Dust, and Why Does It Blew Up? Over the years, many people have come to challenge the authenticity of crypto trading and become fans of its profit potential and use cases. The same happened with Basement Ron, a Gold enthusiast who wanted to prove that crypto is nothing and Gold is the real investment. To do so, he launched a Solana meme coin called Unicorn Fart Dust (UFD) and posted about this to let the people know how it failed. However, to his surprise, the token blew up within days, reaching a market cap of $500M. Moreover, the UFD price surged by 5,500%, making heavy returns for its holders, aka crypto traders. The token currently trades at $0.1666 with a market capitalization of $165M after a 42% surge in the last 24 hours. It also has a trading volume of $53,519,706 per Coingecko, representing its high demand. Interestingly, this is not the first time the crypto community has come together to prove someone wrong. Earlier, a GenZ kid launched a meme coin on pump.fun and attempted to use a rug pull scam. However, the crypto trading community pumped the token by 71,000%, leaving the kid with a minimal profit as he sold early. What’s The Lesson Here? Crypto trading is a vast industry, facilitating billions of trades. Some turn profitable, and others in loss. Here, the unpredictability and crypto market volatility make it even more challenging. However, a few with experience and crypto tradies strategies have made heavy returns, including this crypto trader who identified the opportunity in Unicorn Fart Dust (UFD) and turned his $90 into $3.25M. However, people must do proper technical analysis and research before investing.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

XRP: A fast and borderless cryptocurrency for seamless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and accessible worldwide. XRP enables secure and irreversible transactions without a central authority. Users do not need a bank account for settlements, making it inclusive. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion units. Ripple, initially called OpenCoin Inc., received 80 billion XRP to develop the ecosystem and improve network liquidity. They placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply release. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” reflecting its goal to facilitate smooth payment transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP’s features may make it an attractive option. Conclusion Although XRP and similar coins show less short-term potential, DOGEN distinguishes itself for those pursuing luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN is creating a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

While this price movement is positive, it does not appear impulsive. Nevertheless, XRP has been printing higher highs and higher lows since reacting to the support zone, signaling some bullish momentum. Fibonacci Targets and Ideal Price Move The current price action is part of an internal wave, and the ideal target for the C-wave of the D-wave is around $2.59. Although it’s uncertain whether the price will reach this level, this Fibonacci extension represents a reasonable milestone target. If this ABC structure plays out, we should see the price move towards this level before completing the larger wave pattern. Following this, an E-wave could set a higher low, paving the way for a potential breakout. Possible Triangle Pattern and Confirmation Needed The current price action could unfold into a triangle pattern, which is another potential scenario. If this is the case, the D-wave may eventually break out to the upside. However, to confirm this, the price must break above the previous A-wave high at $2.38-$2.39. If XRP fails to surpass this level, there is a possibility that the market is developing a different structure, such as the B-wave. Bullish and Alternative Wave Counts In the bullish triangle scenario, the pattern would involve waves A, B, C, D, and E, with no lower lows—just lower highs and higher lows before an upward move. Alternatively, in the blue wave count, we could be seeing a larger correction with a WX-Y structure, where the Y-wave could evolve into a triangle pattern. This scenario remains speculative at this stage, but it’s essential to consider as a potential market development. Key Levels to Watch: Support and Invalidation Points So far, support is holding strong. To invalidate the current bullish outlook, XRP would need to break below $2.24, followed by a drop below the swing low at $1.94, which occurred on December 20th. If these levels are breached, the blue wave count could become more likely, potentially leading to further downside and a move towards the Fibonacci target area between $1.80 and $1.39. Larger Time Frame: Long-Term Outlook On the larger time frame, if XRP continues its sideways movement or forms a wave four correction as outlined earlier, the overall pattern still suggests at least one more high, and potentially two, before completing the current wave structure. The next key targets could be around $3.25 to $3.30, which is near the all-time high.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-25 05:56:34
