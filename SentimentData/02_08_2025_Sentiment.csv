In just one hour, major exchanges saw an astounding $138 million worth of futures contracts wiped out. Expanding this view, the past 24 hours witnessed an even more substantial sum, with nearly $1 billion – specifically $987 million – in futures liquidations. These figures are not just numbers; they represent the sudden unwinding of leveraged positions, often leading to cascading effects across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space, from seasoned traders to curious observers. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? To grasp the gravity of recent events, it’s essential to understand the core concept of Crypto Futures Liquidation . In essence, futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Many traders use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their potential returns. While leverage can boost profits, it also magnifies losses. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the minimum required level to maintain their leveraged position. This typically happens due to adverse price movements in the underlying asset. The Role of Leverage: Traders use leverage to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For instance, 10x leverage means a $1,000 investment controls $10,000 worth of crypto. Margin Call and Forced Closure: If the market moves against a leveraged position, the exchange will issue a ‘margin call,’ requesting more funds. If the trader fails to add more collateral, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, leading to liquidation. Impact on Market Price: Large-scale liquidations can create a ‘liquidation cascade.’ As positions are forcibly closed, they often involve selling the underlying asset, which can push prices down further, triggering more liquidations in a chain reaction. Why Do Such Massive Liquidations Occur? The recent wave of Crypto Futures Liquidation events can be attributed to several interconnected factors, often triggered by sudden market volatility. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently dynamic, and certain conditions can accelerate these liquidation spirals. Understanding these triggers is key to anticipating and navigating similar events in the future. Factor Description Sudden Price Swings Unforeseen market news, macroeconomic data, or large whale movements can cause rapid price changes, quickly hitting liquidation thresholds. High Leverage Usage An environment where many traders are using high leverage amplifies the impact of even small price movements, making liquidations more frequent and larger. Liquidation Cascades Initial liquidations force selling, which pushes prices further, triggering more liquidations in a self-reinforcing downward spiral. Funding Rate Dynamics In perpetual futures, funding rates can become significantly positive or negative, influencing trader behavior and sometimes leading to unwinding of positions. How Does Crypto Futures Liquidation Impact the Broader Market? The immediate consequence of large-scale Crypto Futures Liquidation is often increased market volatility. When hundreds of millions of dollars in positions are closed, it creates significant selling pressure, which can lead to rapid price drops. This can erode market confidence and lead to a ‘fear, uncertainty, and doubt’ (FUD) sentiment among investors. However, it’s not always negative; these events can also present opportunities for those with capital ready to buy assets at lower prices. Understanding the dynamics of futures liquidation is crucial for navigating volatile crypto markets. Crypto Futures Liquidation: Massive Market Turbulence Unfolds Beyond the immediate price action, massive liquidations offer insights into market health and trader sentiment. A period of high liquidations often indicates that the market was overleveraged, and a ‘deleveraging’ event is occurring. This can be seen as a necessary cleansing, potentially setting the stage for a healthier, more sustainable rally in the future, as speculative excess is flushed out. Navigating the Turbulence: Actionable Insights for Traders For traders, understanding and adapting to the potential for Crypto Futures Liquidation is paramount. While market volatility is unavoidable, certain strategies can help mitigate risks and even capitalize on opportunities during turbulent times. Manage Your Leverage: The simplest way to avoid liquidation is to use lower leverage. Higher leverage amplifies both gains and losses, bringing your liquidation price closer to your entry price. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting your potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. This is a critical risk management tool. Maintain Adequate Margin: Always ensure you have sufficient margin in your account. If you receive a margin call, consider adding more collateral rather than letting your position be liquidated. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, economic indicators, and on-chain data. Sudden shifts in these areas often precede significant price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While not directly preventing liquidation on a single futures position, diversification can protect your overall portfolio from being wiped out by a single adverse event. Consider Hedging Strategies: More advanced traders might use hedging techniques, such as taking an opposite spot position, to offset potential losses in their futures contracts. What Does the Future Hold After Such Liquidation Events? Historically, large Crypto Futures Liquidation events have often preceded periods of market consolidation or even recovery. While the immediate aftermath can be unsettling, these ‘flush-out’ moments can remove excessive speculative positions, paving the way for more organic price discovery. The market’s resilience is often tested during such times, and its ability to rebound speaks volumes about the underlying strength and continued interest in digital assets. For long-term investors, these events can be seen as opportunities to accumulate assets at potentially discounted prices. For short-term traders, they highlight the importance of robust risk management and a clear understanding of market mechanics. The crypto market continues to mature, and events like these, while impactful, are part of its evolutionary process, teaching participants valuable lessons about volatility and risk. In conclusion, the recent massive Crypto Futures Liquidation serves as a potent reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in the volatile world of cryptocurrency derivatives. While the numbers are striking, they underscore the critical importance of prudent risk management, a deep understanding of market dynamics, and the ability to adapt to rapid changes. For those who navigate these waters wisely, opportunities often emerge from the very turbulence that challenges others. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary cause of Crypto Futures Liquidation? A1: The primary cause is when a trader’s leveraged position experiences significant losses due to adverse price movements, causing their margin balance to fall below the exchange’s required maintenance margin. If they cannot add more funds, the position is automatically closed. Q2: How can I protect myself from Crypto Futures Liquidation? A2: Key strategies include using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in your account, and staying informed about market conditions to anticipate potential volatility. Q3: Do large liquidations always lead to a market crash? A3: Not necessarily. While large liquidations can cause immediate price drops due to selling pressure, they often act as a ‘reset’ for an overleveraged market. After the initial shock, the market may consolidate or even recover, as speculative excess is cleared. Q4: Are futures contracts only for experienced traders? A4: Futures trading, especially with leverage, carries significant risk and is generally recommended for experienced traders who have a thorough understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and the potential for rapid losses. Beginners should start with spot trading or lower-risk strategies. Q5: What is the difference between margin and liquidation price? A5: Margin is the collateral you put up to open and maintain a leveraged position. The liquidation price is the specific price point at which your position will be automatically closed by the exchange if the market moves against you and your margin falls below the required level. Q6: Can Crypto Futures Liquidation be predicted? A6: While the exact timing and scale are difficult to predict, traders can look for indicators such as high open interest, significant leverage ratios across exchanges, and areas of strong support/resistance that, if broken, could trigger cascading liquidations. Monitoring funding rates also provides insights into market sentiment. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Whether it is a surge in on-chain activity, growing community interest, or high-impact announcements, certain projects are showing real staying power. This list dives into four of the top crypto for 2025 that are making waves right now. BlockDAG (BDAG) , SEI, Ethena (ENA), and SUI each offer something unique, from mining accessibility to deep liquidity and ecosystem growth. Their strengths may differ, but one thing is consistent. These projects are not just hype driven mentions. They are gaining traction where it counts. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Builds First, Then Launches With Real Adoption BlockDAG stands apart by entering the market fully built rather than promising to deliver later. It already runs on its own custom Layer 1 network, complete with the X1 mobile mining app, physical mining devices in the X-Series, and a growing developer ecosystem. This kind of readiness gives users and builders immediate tools to engage and build. Over 2.5 million people are actively mining BDAG through the X1 app, with nearly 18,880 mining rigs sold to date. These are not idle numbers. They represent real-world usage, with users earning coins daily and contributing to network activity before the project has even gone live. The numbers behind its presale are just as striking. BlockDAG has raised over $358 million and sold 24.6 billion coins. With a current price of $0.0016 and a confirmed listing at $0.05, the upside potential is significant. For those tracking the top crypto for 2025, BlockDAG combines technology, traction, and timing. 2. SEI (SEI): Shows Strength as TVL Rockets Past $600M SEI is quickly gaining ground as one of the top cryptos for 2025, thanks to rapid growth in Total Value Locked and a strong backing from Circle. TVL has climbed from $28 million to over $600 million this year, and transaction speeds are now beating major networks like Ethereum and Arbitrum. On-chain metrics suggest real utility is driving the surge, not just hype. Currently trading between $0.31 and $0.33, SEI faces short-term resistance at $0.35. Analysts believe that breaking this level could set the stage for a larger move toward $1.00 within the year. With adoption on the rise and liquidity expanding, long-term projections now stretch toward $3 by 2030. 3. Ethena (ENA): Buybacks and Yield Power Spark DeFi Buzz Ethena (ENA) is drawing attention as a top crypto for 2025 after launching a $260 million token buyback strategy. This move is tightening supply and injecting liquidity into the ecosystem, placing ENA firmly in the DeFi spotlight. Its recent earnings have even outpaced major players like Circle and PancakeSwap, suggesting a strong foundation for future gains. Trading near $0.60, ENA has pushed through earlier resistance zones and is now targeting $0.85 to $1.00. Some indicators suggest a cooldown may come first, but volume remains healthy. If momentum holds, ENA could be setting up for an extended breakout. 4. SUI (SUI): Volume Surges, But Token Unlock Looms SUI continues to impress with daily trading volumes topping $2 billion and stablecoin usage now outpacing Solana. This kind of activity places SUI among the top crypto for 2025, especially as it builds out its ecosystem. On-chain data shows growing traction and utility, helping SUI maintain strong positioning across market cycles. However, a looming $240 million token unlock could introduce short-term pressure. Current prices sit around $3.70 to $3.80, with analysts watching closely for a break above $4.00. If bullish momentum returns, the next target could be $4.50 or higher, with long-range forecasts pointing toward $6 or even $10 by 2030. Quick Recap SEI is gaining real traction on-chain, ENA’s buyback strategy is tightening supply, and SUI’s trading volume continues to impress. Each shows promise, but among the top cryptos for 2025, BlockDAG brings something different. It is not just building hype; it is already delivering results with working products and a growing ecosystem. With over 2.5 million miners, 18,880 hardware units sold, and a presale that has raised $358 million, BlockDAG enters the market fully equipped. While others are still developing, BlockDAG is already functioning at scale, making it one of the most complete and compelling projects to watch right now.

Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert The Ethereum Foundation has released a long-term roadmap called the “Ethereum Lean Plan.” The focus: scale the network massively, keep it online 100% of the time, and prepare for future threats—including powerful quantum computers. Big Goals For The Next Decade The Foundation says Ethereum will continue operating with no downtime, just as it has since its launch in 2015. The team wants to make sure that even if nation-states or supercomputers try to take it down, Ethereum will survive. In addition to that, Ethereum also intends to scale considerably. The strategy involves 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) on the layer 1 chain and 1 million TPS on layer 2 chains. All of these will be accomplished with improved tools, such as zkVMs and Data Availability Sampling (DAS), to assist users in being able to verify the chain more quickly without having to download everything. All Eyes On Lean Consensus And Speed Upgrades The Lean Plan will enhance all three sublayers of Ethereum’s foundation layer. The crew would like to implement what it refers to as a “lean consensus,” or quicker transaction confirmations and better data handling. New technology such as SNARK-friendly code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is being developed to speed up and make the network lighter. These upgrades will provide finality in seconds instead of minutes, a significant boon for users seeking quick and trustworthy results. The Foundation also intends to advance cryptography to secure Ethereum against quantum attacks. The mission is straightforward: safeguard user balances and smart contracts prior to quantum computers posing an actual threat. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode?

ETH is also doing well on the market. At the time of the report, the token was trading at $3,610 after gaining 47% over the last month. The Foundation called the new vision a “generational oath” to keep Ethereum alive, safe, and ready for the next wave of users and developers. This 10-year roadmap is ambitious, but if the team delivers, Ethereum could become much faster and stronger than it is today.

Recently, a significant development occurred: the Bitcoin price drop , with BTC falling below the crucial $113,000 mark. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is currently trading at approximately $112,980 on the Binance USDT market. This latest dip raises questions about market stability, investor sentiment, and what might be next for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the forces behind such a decline is essential for anyone navigating the digital asset landscape. For both seasoned traders and newcomers, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can trigger a range of reactions, from concern to strategic planning. This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of this recent movement, delving into potential causes, broader market impacts, and actionable insights for investors. We will explore the nuances of market volatility and discuss how participants can best position themselves during such periods. By understanding the underlying dynamics, you can better navigate the often-turbulent waters of the crypto market. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? A Bitcoin price drop is rarely attributable to a single factor. Instead, it often results from a confluence of macroeconomic indicators, market sentiment shifts, and specific crypto-related news. Pinpointing the exact trigger for BTC falling below $113,000 requires looking at several potential influences: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as rising inflation, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to de-risk. This means pulling capital from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies and moving it into more traditional, safer havens. Bitcoin, despite its growing acceptance, is still largely perceived as a risk-on asset. Whale Movements: Large transactions by ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin – can significantly influence market prices. A major sell-off by a whale can flood the market with supply, leading to a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Monitoring on-chain data for large transfers to exchanges can sometimes offer early indications. Regulatory Scrutiny: News of impending or proposed cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can create uncertainty and fear among investors. Stricter rules or outright bans in certain regions can lead to a sell-off as market participants anticipate reduced liquidity or accessibility. Technical Breakdown: From a technical analysis perspective, breaking below a significant support level, such as $113,000, can trigger automated sell orders and psychological panic. This creates a cascading effect, pushing the price further down as more investors react to the breached threshold. It is important to remember that markets are complex systems, and these factors often interact in intricate ways, making precise causation difficult to isolate immediately after a Bitcoin price drop . How Does a Bitcoin Price Drop Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization means its price movements often dictate the direction of the broader crypto market. When a Bitcoin price drop occurs, it typically sends ripples through the altcoin ecosystem. This phenomenon is often referred to as ‘Bitcoin dominance,’ where BTC’s performance heavily influences the collective sentiment and price action of other digital assets. Here is a general overview of how a significant Bitcoin decline can affect different segments of the crypto market: Market Segment Typical Impact of BTC Drop Explanation Large-Cap Altcoins (e.g., Ethereum) Moderate to High Correlation Often follow BTC’s trend due to similar investor sentiment and capital flows. Mid-Cap Altcoins High Volatility, Strong Correlation More susceptible to panic selling; often see amplified losses during a Bitcoin price drop. Small-Cap/Meme Coins Extreme Volatility, Very High Correlation Can experience disproportionately large declines as investors flee high-risk assets. Stablecoins Increased Demand Investors often move funds into stablecoins to preserve capital during market downturns. The correlation between Bitcoin and altcoins is not always perfect, and some projects with strong fundamentals or unique use cases may show more resilience. However, in a broad market downturn triggered by a significant Bitcoin price drop , most assets tend to move in the same direction. Is This Bitcoin Price Drop an Opportunity or a Warning? Every significant market movement, including a Bitcoin price drop , presents a dual perspective: an opportunity for some and a warning for others. How one interprets this depends largely on their investment horizon, risk tolerance, and overall strategy. For long-term investors and ‘hodlers’: A decline like the recent one can be viewed as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity. If one believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a decentralized, scarce digital asset, then lower prices simply mean an opportunity to accumulate more at a reduced cost. This strategy relies on the conviction that Bitcoin will eventually recover and reach new highs, as it has done repeatedly throughout its history. This approach often involves dollar-cost averaging, where a fixed amount is invested regularly, regardless of price, smoothing out the average purchase price over time. For short-term traders and those with high leverage: A sharp Bitcoin price drop can be a significant warning. High leverage positions can be quickly liquidated during volatile periods, leading to substantial losses. For these participants, the decline signals increased risk and the need for careful risk management, including setting stop-loss orders and reducing exposure. The speed at which Bitcoin fell below $113,000 underscores the dangers of over-leveraging in such a dynamic market. Ultimately, whether this specific Bitcoin price drop is an opportunity or a warning depends on individual circumstances. It is crucial for every investor to conduct their own research, understand their personal financial goals, and avoid making impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Navigating Volatility: Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Drop Market volatility, characterized by sharp price swings, is an inherent feature of the cryptocurrency space. While a Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling, having a clear strategy can help investors navigate these turbulent times effectively. Here are some actionable insights and strategies: Risk Management is Key: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This fundamental principle is even more critical during periods of high volatility. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, or even beyond just cryptocurrencies, can also mitigate risk. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): As mentioned, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy helps to average out your purchase price over time and reduces the impact of short-term price fluctuations, turning a Bitcoin price drop into an accumulation phase. Long-Term Perspective: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment. Focusing on the long-term vision rather than daily price movements can help reduce emotional decision-making. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous significant corrections to reach new all-time highs. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: While it is important to stay updated on market news, constant monitoring of charts can lead to emotional fatigue and impulsive trades. Focus on credible sources of information and avoid succumbing to ‘Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt’ (FUD) or ‘Fear of Missing Out’ (FOMO). Consider Taking Profits: For those who entered the market at lower prices, a strategic approach might involve taking partial profits during rallies to secure gains and reduce overall exposure. This can provide a buffer during a subsequent Bitcoin price drop . The Broader Perspective: Why Bitcoin’s Resilience Matters While a Bitcoin price drop below $113,000 is a notable event, it is crucial to place it within the broader historical context of Bitcoin’s journey. Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections and bear markets throughout its existence, some far more severe than the current one. Each time, it has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for recovery and growth, often reaching new all-time highs in subsequent bull cycles. This resilience is attributed to several factors: its decentralized nature, its finite supply (capped at 21 million coins), and its growing adoption by institutional investors and corporations. Despite temporary setbacks, the underlying technology and the network’s security continue to attract interest and investment. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against inflation continues to resonate with a significant portion of the global investment community. Understanding these fundamental strengths helps provide a calmer perspective during a period of a Bitcoin price drop . It reminds investors that short-term volatility is a normal part of a nascent asset class’s development, and it does not necessarily negate its long-term potential. The recent Bitcoin price drop is a reminder of market volatility. Bitcoin Price Drop: Unveiling the Alarming Decline Below $113,000 In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $113,000 is a significant event in the cryptocurrency market. While it naturally causes concern, it also serves as a critical reminder of the market’s inherent volatility and the importance of a well-informed, strategic approach to investing. By understanding the potential triggers, the broader market impact, and employing sound risk management strategies, investors can navigate these fluctuations more effectively. Bitcoin’s history of resilience suggests that while short-term dips are inevitable, its long-term trajectory remains a subject of ongoing interest and belief for many. Staying calm, sticking to your investment plan, and focusing on the long-term fundamentals are paramount during such market conditions.

On Thursday, SEC Chair Paul Atkins called for the “reshoring” of crypto companies that had previously fled abroad amid regulatory uncertainty. The comments, delivered in a speech at the America First Policy Institute, followed a wider push by the Trump administration to make the US a top destination for digital assets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the message a day later, proclaiming a “golden age of crypto” and welcoming global builders to base their operations in the US. International Companies Back in the US Market The policy shift is bearing fruit. Bulgaria-based Nexo re-entered the US market in April after several years’ absence, citing a more welcoming environment. Seychelles-based OKX restarted its US operations in June, choosing San Jose, California, as its new base following a $500 million settlement with regulators. Meanwhile, Chinese mining giant Bitmain announced that it would have an ASIC production facility in the US by 2026 and is opening a headquarters in either Florida or Texas. Competitors Canaan and MicroBT also have production supposedly coming stateside. Domestic Companies Scale Up Operations US-based Kraken and MoonPay companies are expanding domestically as well. Kraken relocated its worldwide headquarters to Cheyenne, Wyoming in June, naming the state’s digital asset-friendly stance as the reason. MoonPay introduced a new headquarters in New York in April and had obtained licensing in all 50 states by June, enabling it to scale operations nationwide. Policy Momentum Draws Industry Home Reshoring is symptomatic of a broader rebalancing of US crypto policy. Underpinned by pro-innovation rhetoric and tangible reforms, the federal government is signaling that digital asset companies are once again welcome.

The watchdog wants to allow more stakeholders to engage directly with Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is leading the initiative. The announcement comes on the heels of Project Crypto — a bold new program introduced by SEC Chair Paul Atkins to rethink how crypto assets are regulated in the US. The initiative seeks to transition more of the financial system “on-chain” and craft a regulatory framework that aligns with rapid digital innovation. Revealed during a livestreamed press conference, the initiative marks a shift from previous efforts driven by large institutions. This time, the spotlight is on smaller crypto ventures with under 10 employees and less than two years in operation. Project Crypto triggers broader conversations Project Crypto is the SEC’s most extensive foray yet into digital assets. It seeks to resolve long-standing regulatory gray areas, including how tokens are categorized, what constitutes a securities offering, and whether decentralized finance should be governed under federal law. In a statement announcing Project Crypto, the SEC said it will also address custody of digital assets, registration paths for crypto projects, and ways to migrate financial system elements onto blockchain infrastructure to enhance transparency and efficiency. Chair Atkins said that Project Crypto was an opportunity to reimagine how the financial system engages with innovation. He emphasized that this process could not happen in a vacuum and stressed the need for real voices, real use cases, and genuine concerns to guide the effort. Commissioner Hester Peirce has been pushing the SEC’s Crypto Task Force for over a year and will preside over the roundtables. Roundtables aimed at small teams and Startups The series of crypto roundtables nationwide will occur from August 4 to Decemb er . The project will open in Berkeley, California, and move on to cities like Boston, Dallas, Chicago, and New York, before going to other towns. Each stop on this tour is intended to help the Commission get in tim ate with smalle r, early-stage crypto start ups that have historically been neglected in regulatory discussions. Unlike the earlier round-to-die type cribs in Washington D.C., where they corralled industry bigwigs and Wall Street mother fucking firms, these are for startups with 10 employees or fewer that have been under two years of operation‎. Coughlin explained in a blog post that the goal is to hear directly from builders—those developing crypto tools, infrastructure, and markets. He added that the roundtables are focused on the people who never had time or resources to attend such precedential events. Hester Peirce, a SEC commissioner who had publicly chided the agency in recent months for failing to advance crypto regulation by not attending earlier meetings on the issue, called Monday’s move a step forward but said it was not meaningful enough to move regulatory work ahead. She added that being inundated with work by the Commission made it difficult to spend even more time engaging, but underlined what smaller players say is precisely relevant in forming actionable and forward-looking legislation. The SEC also has said these roundtables should be open, not exclusive, for serious discussion and dialogue rather than counterproductive lawyering. At the very least, feedback from its tour can help inform future proposals for rules and regulate what authority it gives to the superintendent, smaller or more nascent entities within crypto. Earlier this year, similar SEC crypto roundtables in Washington included the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, along with two cryptocurrency exchanges — Coinbase and Kraken. Topics ranged from crypto custody to tokenized securities and merging DeFi with traditional finance. But others criticized these hours for leaving out the “long tail” of crypto in nov ation — the scrappy, earl y-sta ge builders toiling without legal teams or institutional support.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/over-110-billion-shiba-inu-shib-stuns-binance-heres-what-happened/,"A newly generated cryptocurrency wallet has withdrawn over 110 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens from Binance, drawing significant interest from the Shiba Inu community and the broader crypto market. This transaction, which was highlighted by blockchain tracker Onchain Lens , occurred on July 30 and was completed in three separate transfers involving two Binance wallets labeled Binance 14 and Binance 15. The total amount withdrawn came to 110.34 billion SHIB, which had an approximate value of $1.45 million at the time of the transfer. As of now, the tokens remain in the recipient wallet with no indication of onward movement, suggesting that the holder intends to retain them, at least in the short term. A newly created wallet has withdrawn tokens worth $4.2M from #Binance : – 80,126 $LINK worth $1.46M – 110.34B $SHIB worth $1.45M – 3.44M $MATIC worth $762K – 142.62 $ETH worth $552K Address: 0x1e29731E8473fc2Ae7593a95813f4B9DCcd4Ee325 pic.twitter.com/rfTALSt2U0 — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) July 31, 2025 Additional Crypto Assets Also Moved The user behind this wallet not only withdraws SHIB. Other crypto assets were also moved from Binance as part of the same wave of transactions. These included 80,126 Chainlink (LINK), valued at about $1.46 million, 3.44 million Polygon (MATIC), worth around $762,000, and 142.62 Ethereum (ETH), with an estimated value of $552,000. Combined, these assets brought the total value withdrawn to over $4.2 million. Such transfers often signal confidence in long-term holdings , especially when funds are moved to private wallets instead of being left on exchanges. Shiba Inu Team Responds to the Transfer Reacting to the SHIB-related transfer, Lucie, who serves as a marketing lead within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, acknowledged the development on social media by simply tweeting “SHIB” accompanied by a heart-eyed emoji. Her brief but upbeat response was widely interpreted as a positive signal, reflecting enthusiasm around what some see as a bullish move by the wallet holder. This comes at a time when SHIB’s on-chain activity is being closely monitored following a similar event last week , during which a separate wallet removed 5 trillion SHIB tokens from Coinbase . One notable aspect of the Binance withdrawal is the timing. The transaction took place shortly after SHIB briefly dropped to $0.00001268 before rebounding above the $0.000013 level. It appears the buyer may have taken advantage of the short-lived dip to acquire SHIB at a more favourable rate. These kinds of strategic moves often reflect a belief in the token’s long-term value and utility.

A general decline has followed the unveiling of yet another tariff policy by U.S. President Donald Trump, which proposes increased import duties on a wide range of countries. This policy shift has unsettled global markets, triggering liquidations of over $754 million in crypto positions in just 24 hours. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 4.51%, now standing at roughly $3.72 trillion. Shiba Inu has not been immune to this trend. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB has declined by 4.14%, currently trading at $0.00001226. Despite the price dip, it remains the 22nd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, holding a total market value of $7.23billion. While SHIB’s recent price performance reflects ongoing volatility in the broader market, the significant withdrawal of over 110 billion tokens from Binance into a private wallet indicates sustained interest from certain holders. This move, combined with past large-scale transfers, suggests that key players may be positioning for long-term involvement, despite short-term price fluctuations.

Analyst Ali Martinez has identified a double bottom pattern forming on XRP’s 4-hour chart, noting that a close above $3.30 could open the door toward the $3.60 range. The chart shows a textbook recovery structure, which could signal a sustained move if confirmed by volume. Currently, XRP trades around $3.17, meaning the next 48 hours may determine whether it breaks out or gets rejected at resistance. Traders are watching closely, especially as bullish catalysts begin to pile up—including a surprise community event just announced by Ripple. Early investors are also scouting altcoins showing breakout behavior , including fast-moving projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now attracting whale capital ahead of its exchange listing. XRP rewards event adds fuel to short-term momentum Ripple’s newly launched XRP Rewards Event is already sparking fresh enthusiasm across the community. The campaign, which allows XRP holders to claim tokens directly from a dedicated portal, is being hailed as a loyalty gesture for those who supported the project during its regulatory battles. While the exact allocation details are still being finalized, the announcement has boosted engagement and brought lapsed traders back into the conversation. On-chain data shows dormant wallets reactivating and XRP mentions climbing across social media platforms. Combined with bullish technicals, this unexpected development could serve as the final push XRP needs to flip resistance into support. Whale buying shifts as breakout potential builds Amid XRP’s rise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming one of the most watched projects among strategic investors. Several crypto whale wallets have started accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE at a rapid pace, signaling confidence in its upside. With limited access still in place, many investors are rushing to get in before a wider wave of attention. The project’s early-mover advantage and record sellout rounds make it one of the top altcoin contenders. Crypto whales are increasingly bullish —large investments flowing rapidly into MAGACOIN FINANCE is now a narrative making rounds in trading circles, and many believe this could be the start of a breakout cycle . Capital rotation could benefit both XRP and early-stage altcoins As XRP’s reward program re-energizes the ecosystem, a broader shift in capital allocation is beginning to emerge. Mid-cap tokens with strong narratives are pulling investor interest away from blue-chip stagnation. If XRP breaks above $3.30, the next wave of inflows may push it past $3.60 and unlock further gains. But for many whales and early adopters, the real opportunity lies in identifying assets with asymmetric upside. Conclusion: Two breakout stories, one market cycle XRP’s technical pattern and ecosystem incentives suggest a breakout may be imminent—but smart money is already preparing for what comes after. The shift toward strategic accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE highlights how whales are positioning early to maximize potential upside . With large investments flowing rapidly into MAGACOIN FINANCE, many are now calling it the next major altcoin breakout . Whether you’re watching XRP’s resistance level or seeking the next SHIBA-style surge, these two assets are where attention is heading fast.

The top cryptocurrency dropped to $113,164, its lowest in weeks, triggering over $200 million in liquidations from leveraged long positions and raising fresh concerns over investor confidence. The drop comes amid escalating geopolitical tension. Trump Orders Submarine Move Amid Russia Tensions, Bitcoin Reacts to Risk Fears Trump announced the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines in response to comments by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. Medvedev had criticized Trump’s ultimatum that Russia end its conflict with Ukraine within ten days, calling it “a step towards war.” “Based on the highly provocative statements of the former president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He added that “Words are very important and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances.” Bitcoin’s price decline followed these remarks from Trump, reflecting broader investor anxiety as tensions between nuclear powers rise. Friday’s market reaction also follows Trump’s public attacks on U.S. economic institutions. The former president accused Erika McEntarfer, Commissioner of Labor Statistics, of manipulating jobs data ahead of the 2024 election to help Kamala Harris. He called for her immediate removal and claimed the Bureau had “faked the jobs numbers” by overstating employment growth. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump wrote. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.” He also turned his attention to the Federal Reserve, sharply criticizing its chair, Jerome Powell. Trump claimed the Fed’s pre-election rate cuts were politically motivated and called Powell “a stubborn MORON.” “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell must substantially lower interest rates NOW,” he wrote. “IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!” While presidents traditionally avoid interfering with central bank decisions, Trump urged Fed officials to overrule Powell and slash rates to support what he described as a booming economy under his leadership. The Fed has held rates steady for five consecutive meetings, citing inflation concerns. But Trump, in a flurry of posts, accused Powell of damaging the economy and failing to act on the consequences of new tariffs. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler Resigns, Opening Key Seat for Trump Amid the political pressure, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler announced her resignation on Friday, creating a key vacancy at the central bank. Kugler, a Biden appointee, joined the Fed’s Board of Governors in 2023 and was a permanent voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee. JUST IN: Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kulger steps down from the Fed pic.twitter.com/QP8SoiX0fJ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) August 1, 2025 She did not give a reason for her early departure but stated she would return to Georgetown University in the fall. “It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve,” Kugler wrote in a letter addressed to Trump. Her exit, nearly 18 months before her term was set to expire, clears a path for Trump to nominate a replacement. Kugler had recently voiced support for keeping rates steady, pending a clearer picture of how tariffs are affecting inflation. She was absent during this week’s policy vote, where two Trump-appointed members dissented, favoring a rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell thanked Kugler for her service, noting her contributions brought “impressive experience and academic insights” to the Board. Bitcoin Slides as Political Tensions and Market Jitters Weigh on Sentiment Bitcoin slipped further on Friday as rising geopolitical tensions and cautious investor sentiment added pressure to already fragile markets. The cryptocurrency is now trading just 7% below its all-time high of $123,182 set in mid-July , though momentum in derivatives markets is showing signs of cooling. Notably, the monthly futures premium for Bitcoin has narrowed to 6%, down from earlier highs this month. Analysts say the drop reflects reduced appetite for leveraged long positions, suggesting traders are becoming more risk-averse despite ongoing institutional interest. Source: Laevitas.ch Bitcoin’s recent price behavior has also contributed to uncertainty. Rather than acting as a hedge, the asset has moved in step with tech stocks, exposing it to broader macro and political shocks. With tensions between the U.S. and Russia flaring again this week, risk appetite appears to be shifting. The political back-and-forth added to a market already grappling with trade friction and weak economic data. While gold has remained stable around $3,350, it has offered little relief for those hoping Bitcoin would act as a safe-haven alternative. Traders appear to be rotating into cash and short-term government bonds as volatility increases. Despite the decline, Bitcoin remains well above its January levels. However, with global uncertainty rising, traders may remain cautious in the short term. Amid the broader pullback, some investors are reassessing Bitcoin’s long-term role. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, previously skeptical, has updated his outlook . Speaking on a recent podcast, Dalio recommended allocating up to 15% of a portfolio to gold or Bitcoin as a hedge against U.S. debt and inflation. “The U.S. is entering a debt doom loop,” he said, referencing Treasury forecasts of $12 trillion in new debt within the next year. Dalio noted that while Bitcoin remains volatile and faces regulatory questions, its role as a store of value is becoming harder to ignore.

As this rapidly evolving sector matures, a crucial question emerges: should the rules that govern traditional financial institutions also apply to the unique, code-driven nature of DeFi? This is precisely the question the DeFi Education Fund (DEF), a prominent crypto lobby group, is tackling head-on. They are advocating for a more nuanced approach to DeFi regulation in the United States, one that thoughtfully distinguishes between the developers building these decentralized protocols and the centralized entities operating within the broader digital asset space. Understanding the Call for Nuanced DeFi Regulation The DEF recently submitted a comprehensive response to the Senate’s request for information regarding its proposed digital asset market structure bill, famously known as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act. This move underscores the urgency with which the DeFi community seeks regulatory clarity and a framework that fosters, rather than stifles, innovation. The core of their argument revolves around creating a regulatory environment that understands the fundamental differences between traditional financial intermediaries and truly decentralized protocols. According to reports from The Block, the DEF’s letter outlined four pivotal goals for the upcoming legislation. These goals are designed to shape a regulatory landscape that is both effective and conducive to the growth of decentralized technologies. Let’s break down these key objectives: Distinction Between DeFi Developers and Centralized Firms: This is perhaps the most critical point. The DEF argues that the role of a developer who writes open-source code for a decentralized protocol is fundamentally different from that of a centralized company offering financial services. Treating them identically could lead to unintended consequences, potentially stifling the very innovation DeFi promises. Clear Definitions for Intermediaries: The digital asset space is complex, with various participants. The DEF advocates for precise legal definitions that clearly identify which intermediaries are required to register with the government and under what circumstances. This clarity is essential for both compliance and consumer protection. Criteria for Truly Decentralized Protocols: How do we determine if a protocol is genuinely decentralized? The DEF proposes establishing clear criteria to make this determination. This would help regulators understand when a protocol truly operates without a central point of control, distinguishing it from projects that merely use the term ‘decentralized’ without embodying its core principles. Technology-Neutral Regulatory Framework: Instead of crafting rules specific to certain technologies (like blockchain or smart contracts), the DEF urges for a framework that focuses on the function or activity being performed, regardless of the underlying technology. This approach ensures that regulations remain relevant as technology evolves and avoids stifling innovation through outdated or overly prescriptive rules. This proactive stance by the DEF follows the U.S. House of Representatives’ own progress, with the passage of its market structure bill, the Digital Asset Markets Clarity Act. These legislative efforts signal a growing recognition in Washington of the need to address digital assets, and the DeFi community is making its voice heard to ensure a sensible path forward. Why is Differentiating Between Centralized and Decentralized Entities So Important for DeFi Regulation? The distinction between centralized and decentralized entities is not merely semantic; it’s foundational to effective DeFi regulation . Centralized entities, like traditional banks or centralized crypto exchanges, have identifiable control points, boards of directors, and often hold customer funds. This makes them amenable to existing regulatory frameworks designed for intermediaries. DeFi protocols, on the other hand, often operate via immutable code on a blockchain, governed by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) or token holders. There might be no single person or entity in control after a protocol is launched and decentralized. Applying regulations meant for centralized intermediaries to these decentralized systems could: Stifle Innovation: Developers might be hesitant to contribute to open-source DeFi projects if they fear being held liable for the actions of a global, permissionless protocol over which they have no ongoing control. Create Regulatory Absurdity: Who would a regulator fine or imprison if a truly decentralized protocol, governed by thousands of anonymous token holders, somehow violated a rule? The concept of ‘responsible party’ becomes elusive. Push Innovation Offshore: Overly burdensome or inappropriate regulation could force talented developers and innovative projects to move to jurisdictions with more accommodating frameworks, diminishing the U.S.’s role in the future of finance. To illustrate the key differences, consider the following: Aspect Centralized Entities (e.g., Traditional Banks, Centralized Exchanges) Decentralized Protocols (DeFi) Control & Governance Single entity, board, or small group of executives. Clear chain of command. Code-driven, community-governed (e.g., DAOs, token holders). No central authority post-decentralization. Intermediary Role Directly facilitates transactions, holds assets, acts as trusted third party. Automated protocols execute transactions based on code. No human intermediary. Liability & Accountability Clear legal entity responsible for operations, compliance, and user funds. Distributed responsibility. Often, the code itself is the ‘executor,’ and liability is complex. Regulatory Applicability Traditional financial services regulations (e.g., KYC, AML, licensing) are directly applicable. Requires a new, tailored approach to avoid over-regulation or misapplication of rules. DeFi Regulation: Urgent Progress for Decentralized Innovation The Push for Federal Preemption in DeFi Regulation Another critical aspect of the DEF’s proposal is the call for federal regulations to override state laws. Currently, the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is a patchwork of varying state-level rules. This creates significant complexity and uncertainty for developers and projects that operate across state lines or globally. Imagine a DeFi protocol developer trying to comply with 50 different sets of state-specific rules. It’s an insurmountable task that drains resources and discourages innovation. A unified federal framework for DeFi regulation would provide much-needed clarity, consistency, and a level playing field. It would: Reduce Compliance Burden: Developers could focus on building rather than navigating a labyrinth of disparate state laws. Foster a National Market: A consistent regulatory environment encourages broader participation and investment across the U.S. Enhance U.S. Competitiveness: A clear, federal framework could position the U.S. as a leader in DeFi innovation, attracting talent and capital that might otherwise go to more regulation-friendly jurisdictions. What are the Challenges and Benefits of this Approach to DeFi Regulation? While the DEF’s proposals offer a clear path forward, implementing such nuanced DeFi regulation is not without its challenges. Regulators face the daunting task of understanding complex, rapidly evolving technology and distinguishing between genuine decentralization and mere decentralization theater. There’s also the challenge of balancing innovation with consumer protection and national security concerns, especially in a borderless digital realm. However, the benefits of adopting a thoughtful, tailored approach to DeFi regulation are substantial: Unleashing Innovation: Clear rules reduce uncertainty, encouraging developers to build and experiment within defined boundaries. Investor Confidence: A well-defined regulatory framework can increase investor confidence, attracting more capital into the DeFi ecosystem. Consumer Protection: By focusing on genuine risks without stifling innovation, regulators can create effective safeguards for users. Maintaining U.S. Leadership: A proactive and sensible approach to DeFi can solidify the U.S.’s position as a global financial technology hub. The DEF’s advocacy is a vital step in shaping the future of finance. Their efforts highlight a growing consensus that effective DeFi regulation must be bespoke, recognizing the unique characteristics of decentralized technologies while upholding core regulatory objectives. As legislative discussions continue, the clarity and foresight proposed by groups like the DEF will be instrumental in ensuring that innovation in the digital asset space can thrive responsibly. Conclusion: Paving the Way for a Robust DeFi Future The push by the DeFi Education Fund for a more intelligent and tailored approach to DeFi regulation marks a significant moment in the ongoing dialogue between innovation and oversight. By emphasizing the crucial distinction between decentralized developers and centralized entities, advocating for clear definitions, promoting technology-neutral frameworks, and seeking federal preemption, the DEF is laying the groundwork for a regulatory environment that truly understands and supports the unique potential of decentralized finance. This thoughtful engagement with policymakers is essential for fostering a robust, secure, and innovative DeFi ecosystem that benefits all participants. The outcome of these legislative efforts will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of decentralized finance for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the DeFi Education Fund (DEF)? The DeFi Education Fund (DEF) is a crypto lobby group dedicated to advocating for sensible and nuanced regulation of decentralized finance (DeFi) in the United States. They engage with policymakers to educate them on DeFi’s unique characteristics and push for frameworks that foster innovation. Why does the DEF want to distinguish between DeFi developers and centralized entities? The DEF believes that DeFi developers, who often contribute to open-source code for decentralized protocols, have a fundamentally different role and risk profile than centralized financial intermediaries. Treating them identically could stifle innovation and misapply traditional financial regulations to systems without central control. What is a technology-neutral regulatory framework? A technology-neutral regulatory framework focuses on the function or activity being performed (e.g., lending, trading) rather than the specific technology used (e.g., blockchain, smart contracts). This approach ensures regulations remain relevant as technology evolves and prevents stifling innovation by not being overly prescriptive about specific tech stacks. What is federal preemption in the context of DeFi regulation? Federal preemption means that federal laws would override conflicting state laws.

49387810,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76488,1754092808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected XRP Price if Western Union and MoneyGram Adopt It,https://timestabloid.com/projected-xrp-price-if-western-union-and-moneygram-adopt-it/,"The price of XRP could see a significant boost if leading remittance firms like Western Union and MoneyGram integrate the cryptocurrency into their global settlement operations. Western Union and MoneyGram are among the largest players in the international remittance industry. Collectively, they facilitate over $350 billion in transfers annually , with Western Union accounting for approximately $150 billion and MoneyGram processing over $200 billion. Given the scale of their operations, any meaningful implementation of XRP in their transaction systems could have a considerable effect on the asset’s market value. Estimating XRP’s Price Based on Full Integration To estimate the potential price impact, a query was posed to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which returned two separate projection models. The first model assumes complete adoption of XRP by both companies, with each holding substantial XRP reserves to ensure quick and efficient transaction settlements. According to this model, around $4.79 billion in XRP would need to be reserved as operational capital. To maintain market stability and prevent liquidity bottlenecks, an additional $14.37 billion in circulating XRP would be required. This base demand was then multiplied by a factor of 50 to reflect speculative trading, investor sentiment, and long-term holding characteristics that have historically influenced the performance of assets like Bitcoin. Under these assumptions, XRP’s value could rise to approximately $12 . The second projection presents a more aggressive outlook. It considers a scenario in which both Western Union and MoneyGram abandon all fiat corridors in favour of XRP for every transaction. This model adjusts for real-world constraints, such as regulatory delays and liquidity locks, by reducing the expected turnover rate of XRP to 1.5 times per year. In this scenario, the firms would need to hold enough XRP to cover their entire annual transaction volume, which places total XRP demand at roughly $700 billion. Dividing this figure by the available circulating supply of 59.23 billion XRP yields a base price of $11.82. Factoring in a multiplier of 8, representing market enthusiasm, long-term accumulation, and potential institutional adoption, the projected price escalates to $94.56. Importantly, these figures reflect the potential value based solely on integration by these two remittance giants. They do not account for other possible use cases, such as adoption by central banks or additional remittance providers, nor do they consider XRP’s deflationary mechanisms. With broader usage, surpassing the $100 mark becomes a conceivable scenario. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Past Partnerships with the Firms Ripple has had previous engagements with both Western Union and MoneyGram . In 2019, Ripple and MoneyGram entered into a partnership enabling the latter to utilize Ripple’s xRapid product for cross-border settlements. Ripple also invested up to $50 million in MoneyGram’s equity during this time. However, the relationship ended in early 2023 following Ripple’s legal issues with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, prompting MoneyGram to halt its use of XRP. Western Union’s interaction with Ripple dates back to 2015, during which it conducted pilot tests using Ripple’s xRapid solution. Despite initial trials, Western Union never moved forward with full-scale adoption. While neither Western Union nor MoneyGram currently uses XRP for settlement, the scale of their operations positions them as potential catalysts for significant price growth if adoption occurs. Theoretical projections show a possible path toward a multi-fold increase in XRP’s value, particularly if supported by favourable market conditions and increased institutional interest. However, these outcomes remain speculative and dependent on many external factors, including regulatory developments and the companies’ strategic directions.

From cross-border settlements to real-world assets, Ripple is building blockchain infrastructure. If recent comments from top banking executives are any indication, XRP may move trillions in value. The Settlement Layer No One Saw Coming According to KingXRP, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is on the brink of a groundbreaking transformation that could unlock a staggering $196 trillion market through the emergence of RealFi and real-world finance powered by blockchain technology. His post includes a recent interview with Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie, where he made a bold declaration that XRP and Ripple will move trillions and tokenize the entire financial system. Related Reading: XRP’s Secret Weapon? Ripple Exec Says It’s Not What You Think As mentioned in the video, XRP is often misunderstood. It can be traded and speculated on like any other asset, but its true purpose goes much deeper. Ripple is the company behind XRP, and it was originally founded to facilitate fast, efficient money transfers across borders. Apparently, XRP is now evolving far beyond simple transactions. It’s becoming a foundational tool for tokenizing a wide range of assets and enabling the movement of value in new and innovative ways. As Ripple continues to advance its level 2 infrastructure, it’s becoming increasingly clear that they are positioning to tokenize the entire financial system. They have acquired a broker-dealer clearing member, which is a strategic move that brings them one step closer to integrating deeply with the traditional financial markets. This move marks what Gilbertie believes is the first step toward integrating traditional finance with DeFi. The acquisition of a broker-dealer isn’t just a technicality, but it’s the kind of infrastructure move that would rewire the system in the future. XRP Moves Into Institutional Payment Rails CryptoGeek has also shared an update on X about Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, stating that banks are now integrating XRP. Meanwhile, Ripple Bank will operate entirely on the XRP Ledger, settling all payments with XRP as its core asset. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Debunks SWIFT Partnership, XRP To Dramatically Change Payments Infrastructure Schwartz emphasized in the video that closing a deal with a bank always feels exciting, and it looks great on paper, which signals validation. However, behind the scenes, it’s a different story, and banks are extremely slow to move, cautious, conservative, and are bound by layers of internal processes. Furthermore, Schwartz stated that the team focused a lot on banks, because landing a press release with a major institution looked like progress. It felt like a milestone, and over time, the firm realized most of them were only in it for the optics.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already reshaping institutional access, many now believe XRP is the logical next candidate. Analysts point to Ripple’s expanding use cases and improved regulatory clarity as key factors strengthening the case for a U.S.-listed XRP ETF. Traders are reacting early—anticipating that a surprise ETF announcement could send XRP soaring. At the same time, this wave of speculation has pushed investors to explore lesser-known altcoins with breakout potential —especially MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is gaining serious momentum . MAGACOIN FINANCE projected for 12,600% ROI as early access demand spikes As investors search for great opportunities ahead of ETF season, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most talked-about altcoins in high-growth circles . Industry forecasts now indicate the project could deliver up to 12,600% ROI , fueled by rapid ecosystem development and intense early-stage demand . Often compared to the early days of DOGECOIN, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its fast-selling access rounds , rising holder activity, and strong forward momentum. The project continues to expand utility for token holders while rewarding strategic entry – traits that analysts believe give it long-term staying power. With exclusive access open now, but for a limited time only , early adopters are moving quickly. For those seeking the next big crypto story before it hits mainstream exchanges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched closely by smart capital. Market conditions favor early-stage tokens ahead of ETF headlines While XRP continues to consolidate near key levels, the broader market is rotating toward undervalued tokens with compelling stories and untapped upside. ETF speculation is creating powerful momentum – but it’s also directing attention toward altcoins that haven’t yet been fully priced in. Early-access projects with strong community traction and expanding utility are beginning to draw capital as investors seek asymmetric opportunities ahead of institutional waves. These types of tokens – still under the radar of institutions – are now being viewed as potential breakout candidates in the next phase of the market cycle. Conclusion: ETF season brews, and new projects capture the early-mover spotlight As the XRP ETF narrative intensifies, traders are recalibrating their strategies—and many are eyeing the next major move. MAGACOIN FINANCE, now forecasted for up to 12,600% ROI , is quickly becoming the breakout altcoin of interest. With limited early access still open , the clock is ticking for those aiming to get in before institutional momentum sweeps the market.

The latest FET price analysis shows real strength after a clean bounce from $0.70, supported by accumulation from smart wallets and bullish year-end forecasts. VeChain is also showing promise. A new partnership with BitGo, a regulated custodian, is setting the stage for tokenized assets and DeFi expansion. With that foundation, VET could be lining up for its next breakout. And then there is BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its mobile mining demo featuring the X1 and X10 has gone viral, showing users how to boost daily earnings by 10 times. With BDAG priced at just $0.0016 and a $0.05 listing locked in, the potential for a 30x return has sparked a wave of interest. FET Builds Momentum as AI Integration Sparks Price Optimism Fetch.ai is showing renewed strength after rebounding from the $0.70 support level. The latest FET price analysis highlights steady accumulation from smart wallets and rising expectations for a near-term move toward $0.79. If adoption continues to expand, some analysts are forecasting a climb to $1.04 by year-end and even a long-range target of $2.85. Fueling this momentum is the recent ASI Pulse update, which introduced AI features aimed at automating trading and energy tasks. With growing interest in artificial intelligence and staking rewards between 10% and 15%, FET is becoming a project to watch in the coming months. VeChain Eyes Higher Levels After BitGo Partnership Boost VeChain is gaining traction following its partnership with BitGo, a move that signals growing confidence in the network’s push into real-world use cases. BitGo’s regulated custody and staking support lays the groundwork for VeChain’s expansion into tokenized assets and DeFi, making it more attractive to institutions. The announcement helped push VET to $0.0255 before it pulled back slightly to around $0.0249. With strong support near $0.024 and bullish sentiment holding, many analysts believe the VeChain price outlook remains positive. A move toward the $0.05 level is still in play if momentum continues. BlockDAG’s X10 Miner Turns Mobile Mining Into a 200 BDAG Daily Powerhouse BlockDAG’s latest X1 and X10 miner demo has captured major attention, and for good reason. The X1 app already stands as the leading mobile mining tool, letting users earn BDAG coins directly from their smartphones. With a size of just 50 MB, it runs smoothly on both Android and iOS, allowing users to collect up to 20 BDAG daily with zero cost or complexity. The new X10 device now takes things to another level. During the demo, BlockDAG showcased how this compact plug-in miner, roughly the size of a Wi-Fi extender, can pair with the X1 app via Bluetooth. Once connected, users can increase their daily mining capacity from 20 to 200 BDAG, all while staying fully off-grid at home. This jump in mining output comes right as the project enters a key moment. BDAG is currently priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29 through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, which runs until August 11. With a confirmed listing at $0.05, that translates to a possible 3,025% return for early participants. Interest is rising fast. BlockDAG now counts over 2.5 million users on the app, with more than $358 million raised and 24.6 billion coins sold. For mobile-first users, the mining window is wide open, but it may not stay that way for long. Market Takeaways FET and VeChain are both making headlines for good reason. FET is showing strong momentum with price targets now aiming above $1, while VeChain’s BitGo partnership has positioned it as a credible long-term contender. Regulated custody and tokenized assets are giving VET a much stronger narrative this cycle. Even so, BlockDAG continues to stand out. BDAG is priced at just $0.0016 with a listing set at $0.05, offering a 3,025% upside. The X1 app lets users mine up to 200 BDAG daily, and with over 2.5 million users already mining, the clock is ticking. BlockDAG is not waiting to build potential; it is already delivering results.

It’s about gauging the collective emotional pulse of investors. This is precisely where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes into play, acting as a valuable barometer for the digital asset landscape. Recently, this important indicator has seen a notable shift, falling to 55 while remaining within the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this movement truly signify for your investment strategy? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and How Does It Work? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool developed by software platform Alternative.me. Its primary purpose is to distill the complex emotional state of the cryptocurrency market into a single, easily digestible number. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index provides a snapshot of whether the market is leaning towards ‘Extreme Fear’ (0) or ‘Extreme Greed’ (100). This index isn’t based on a single metric; rather, it aggregates data from various sources, each weighted differently to provide a holistic view. By combining these diverse factors, the index aims to offer a more reliable gauge of sentiment than any single indicator could on its own. It’s a testament to the idea that market movements are often driven by human emotion as much as by fundamental analysis. Here’s a breakdown of the key components that contribute to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : Factor Weighting Contribution Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes current volume and market momentum, comparing it to average values. Social Media 15% Assesses sentiment from various social media platforms (currently paused). Surveys 15% Gauges investor sentiment through weekly polls (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Why Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matter for Investors? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just curiosity; it’s a strategic advantage. Historically, extreme fear often presents buying opportunities, as panic selling can drive prices below their intrinsic value. Conversely, extreme greed can signal a market ripe for correction, as irrational exuberance often leads to overvaluation. For savvy investors, the index acts as a counter-indicator. When the market is fearful, it might be time to consider accumulating assets. When the market is greedy, it might be a moment to consider taking profits or exercising caution. It helps in making more informed decisions by providing a macro-level view of market psychology, which often precedes significant price movements. It’s important to remember that the index is a tool, not a crystal ball. It complements fundamental and technical analysis, providing a behavioral finance perspective that many traditional indicators miss. Analyzing the Current State: Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 55 The recent drop of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 55, down 10 points from the previous day, while still residing in the ‘Greed’ zone, warrants careful consideration. A reading of 55 indicates that while there is still a prevailing sense of optimism and positive sentiment in the market, the intensity of that ‘Greed’ has somewhat diminished. This isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’ (which would be closer to 75-100), but rather a moderate level of bullishness. The 10-point drop suggests a slight cooling off of investor enthusiasm or perhaps a minor increase in caution. This could be due to a variety of factors: recent price corrections, negative news events, or simply a natural ebb and flow of market cycles. It implies that while investors are still willing to buy, the aggressive buying seen during periods of higher greed might be subsiding. For investors, this shift from a higher ‘Greed’ score to a lower one within the same zone can be a subtle signal. It suggests that the market might be consolidating or preparing for a period of less rapid growth, rather than an immediate reversal. It’s a moment for observation and strategic planning. Navigating Market Sentiment: Strategies Informed by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index How can investors effectively use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to inform their decisions? It’s about understanding the context of the number and applying it to your personal investment philosophy. Here are some actionable insights: When the Index is Low (Extreme Fear): This is often when market opportunities arise. As the old adage goes, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Low readings (0-20) can indicate panic selling, potentially allowing for purchases at discounted prices. When the Index is High (Extreme Greed): High readings (75-100) might signal that the market is overheating. This could be a good time to consider taking some profits, rebalancing your portfolio, or tightening stop-loss orders. It’s a period where irrational exuberance can lead to unsustainable price levels. During Moderate Readings (like 55): A reading of 55, still in ‘Greed’ but lower than before, suggests a healthy, but perhaps slowing, bullish trend. This is a time for careful due diligence. It’s not a signal for immediate panic or euphoria, but rather a reminder to stick to your long-term strategy and avoid impulsive decisions. Trend Analysis: Pay attention to the direction of the index. A consistent upward trend towards ‘Greed’ could signal growing bullish momentum, while a consistent downward trend towards ‘Fear’ could suggest increasing bearish pressure. The 10-point drop to 55 is an example of such a downward trend within a zone. Challenges and Limitations of Relying on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it’s not without its limitations. Firstly, it’s primarily focused on Bitcoin, which, while dominant, doesn’t always reflect the exact sentiment across all altcoins. Secondly, the ‘Surveys’ and ‘Social Media’ components, which contribute 30% of the weighting, are currently paused. This means the index is relying on a narrower set of data, potentially impacting its overall accuracy and completeness. Furthermore, market sentiment can change rapidly, and the index is a lagging indicator to some extent. It reflects past and current sentiment, but doesn’t predict future events with certainty. It should always be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, including technical charts, fundamental project analysis, and broader economic news. Over-reliance on any single indicator can lead to misinformed decisions.

This monumental movement, valued at approximately $886 million, has certainly captured the attention of the crypto world, prompting questions about its origins and implications. When such significant sums of digital assets change hands, especially involving a major player like Ripple, the cryptocurrency community takes notice. What Exactly Happened with This XRP Transfer? The cryptocurrency tracking service Whale Alert was the first to report this substantial XRP transfer . Their data indicated that 300,000,000 XRP moved from an unidentified wallet to Ripple’s treasury. This kind of transaction is not entirely uncommon in the blockchain space, where large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ frequently move substantial amounts of digital assets. However, the sheer scale of this particular transfer, nearly a billion dollars in value, makes it stand out. Understanding the nature of such a large XRP transfer requires a look at the various possibilities: Internal Treasury Management: Ripple, as a major holder of XRP, often moves tokens between its own wallets for various operational purposes, including managing liquidity, funding partnerships, or preparing for strategic sales. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal Settlement: A large institutional investor or partner might have completed an OTC purchase of XRP from Ripple, and this transfer could represent the movement of funds from the buyer’s wallet to Ripple’s for settlement. Return of Loans or Funds: Less common, but possible, an entity that received XRP from Ripple for a specific purpose (e.g., liquidity provision, development grants) could be returning unused or reallocated funds. The anonymity of the ‘unknown wallet’ adds a layer of speculation, as it could belong to an individual, an institution, or even another Ripple-affiliated entity not publicly identified. Why Does a Large XRP Transfer Like This Matter? The movement of such a significant amount of XRP can have several implications for the market and for Ripple itself. Here are some key reasons why this XRP transfer is noteworthy: Market Sentiment: Large transfers can sometimes trigger concerns about potential selling pressure if the tokens are moved to an exchange. Conversely, if they are moved to a company wallet, it might signal strategic deployment or accumulation. Liquidity Management: For a company like Ripple, managing vast amounts of XRP is crucial for its operations, particularly for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which uses XRP for cross-border payments. Transparency vs. Anonymity: While the blockchain offers transparency in transaction details, the identities behind ‘unknown wallets’ remain private, leading to speculation and analysis within the community. To put the scale of this XRP transfer into perspective, consider the typical daily trading volumes and the total circulating supply of XRP. A transfer of 300 million tokens represents a substantial fraction of the daily volume on many exchanges, even if it does not directly enter the open market. How Does Ripple Typically Manage Its XRP Holdings After an XRP Transfer? Ripple holds a significant portion of the total XRP supply, much of which is held in escrow. Each month, a portion of this escrowed XRP is released, with unused amounts being returned to escrow. This system is designed to provide predictability and manage the supply of XRP. However, transfers like the one reported by Whale Alert often involve funds outside of the regular escrow releases. Ripple’s strategy involves using XRP for various purposes: Ecosystem Development: Funding projects, grants, and partnerships that build on the XRP Ledger. ODL Corridors: Providing liquidity for its cross-border payment solutions. Strategic Sales: Selling XRP to institutional buyers and partners, often through OTC desks, to avoid impacting market price significantly. The reported XRP transfer could align with any of these strategic objectives, suggesting a calculated move rather than an arbitrary one. The company’s long-term vision for XRP as a bridge currency in global payments underpins its management of these digital assets. What Are the Potential Market Implications and Investor Insights from This XRP Transfer? Whenever a large XRP transfer occurs, investors and market analysts scrutinize the potential impact on price and market dynamics. While an internal transfer to Ripple’s wallet is generally less bearish than a transfer to an exchange, it still warrants attention. Consider the following: Short-Term Volatility: Even if the tokens are not immediately sold, the news of such a large movement can cause temporary price fluctuations as traders react to the information. Long-Term Stability: If the transfer is part of a strategic initiative, it could contribute to XRP’s long-term utility and adoption, potentially leading to price stability or growth over time. Confidence in Ripple: Moves that indicate active development or strategic partnerships can bolster investor confidence in Ripple’s business model and the future of XRP. Here’s a breakdown of different types of large XRP movements and their typical implications: Type of XRP Transfer Typical Source/Destination Potential Implication Exchange Deposit Unknown Wallet to Exchange Potential selling pressure, increased supply on market Exchange Withdrawal Exchange to Unknown Wallet Potential accumulation, long-term holding outside exchanges Internal Treasury Move Company Wallet to Company Wallet Strategic management, no immediate market impact expected OTC Deal Settlement Unknown Wallet to Institution/Company Large private sale, off-market transaction, often positive The table illustrates various types of significant XRP movements and their potential market impacts. XRP Transfer: Unveiling a Massive $886 Million Move to Ripple What Challenges and Opportunities Arise from a Major XRP Transfer? While the immediate reaction to a large XRP transfer can be speculation, it also presents both challenges and opportunities for the broader XRP ecosystem. Challenges: Misinterpretation: Without clear communication, large transfers can be misinterpreted as bearish signals, leading to unnecessary FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among retail investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: The movement of such large sums can attract attention from regulators, especially given the ongoing legal landscape surrounding XRP. Market Manipulation Concerns: Though unlikely for a direct transfer to Ripple, large whale movements can sometimes be associated with attempts to influence market prices. Opportunities: Strategic Deployment: If this transfer is for a new ODL corridor, a major partnership, or a significant investment, it could signal strong future growth for XRP adoption. Increased Liquidity: Centralized management of funds can lead to more efficient deployment, improving liquidity where needed for Ripple’s products. Reinforced Confidence: For those who believe in Ripple’s long-term vision, such strategic moves reaffirm the company’s commitment to building out the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Actionable Insights for XRP Holders Following This XRP Transfer For current or prospective XRP holders, understanding the nuances of such events is key to making informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Avoid Impulsive Reactions: Do not panic or make sudden trading decisions based solely on a single whale alert. Large transfers are complex and rarely have a simple interpretation. Look for Context: Always seek additional information. Is Ripple making any announcements? Are there new partnerships or developments that could explain the transfer? Focus on Fundamentals: The long-term value of XRP is tied to its utility, adoption by financial institutions, and the strength of the XRP Ledger ecosystem, not just isolated large transfers. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on a single asset can expose you to greater risk. Diversification remains a prudent strategy in the volatile crypto market. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and blockchain analytics platforms to get a complete picture of market movements and company activities. The recent XRP transfer of 300,000,000 tokens to Ripple is a significant event that highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact purpose of this monumental move remains undisclosed by Ripple, it underscores the company’s active management of its digital assets and its ongoing efforts to build out the XRP ecosystem. Such large-scale movements are a reminder of the powerful forces at play in the digital economy, where strategic decisions by major players can send ripples across the entire market. As always, staying informed and adopting a long-term perspective are crucial for navigating these exciting yet unpredictable waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an “unknown wallet” mean in the context of an XRP transfer? An “unknown wallet” refers to a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly identified or attributed to a specific individual, exchange, or entity. While the transaction itself is transparent on the blockchain, the owner’s identity remains private. Q2: Does this large XRP transfer directly impact XRP’s price? Not necessarily directly or immediately. While the news can cause short-term speculation, a transfer to Ripple’s wallet is less likely to cause a price drop than a transfer to an exchange, which might signal intent to sell. The impact depends on Ripple’s subsequent actions. Q3: Is this XRP transfer related to Ripple’s monthly escrow releases? Typically, no. Ripple’s escrow releases are a scheduled event where a set amount of XRP is unlocked from escrow. This particular XRP transfer from an external “unknown wallet” to Ripple’s address is a separate, distinct event. Q4: Why does Ripple hold so much XRP? Ripple initially held a large portion of XRP to fund its operations, develop the XRP Ledger, and incentivize adoption of its products like On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). These holdings are strategically managed to support the ecosystem’s growth and utility. Q5: How can I track large XRP transfers myself? You can track large XRP transfers using blockchain explorers and whale tracking services like Whale Alert. These platforms monitor significant movements of various cryptocurrencies and report them in real-time. Did you find this article insightful?

49389004,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76490,1754094636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Price Outlook if Ripple Becomes Treasury Company,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-outlook-if-ripple-becomes-treasury-company/,"There has been growing speculation that Ripple could pivot toward functioning as an XRP treasury company, following a model similar to Strategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy. This shift could have major implications for XRP’s valuation, particularly given the scale of Ripple’s current holdings. Ripple currently controls approximately 40.67 billion XRP, roughly 41% of the token’s total supply. At current prices, this stake is worth over $122 billion. Comparatively, Strategy’s Bitcoin reserves total 628,791 BTC, valued at around $72.6 billion. Ripple’s large holdings make it uniquely positioned to influence market supply and sentiment if it transitions into a treasury-focused organization that accumulates, rather than distributes, XRP. To evaluate the potential market impact of such a strategy, both OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google Gemini were asked to generate independent price forecasts under various assumptions. ChatGPT’s Projections for a Treasury-Focused Ripple ChatGPT offered multiple models based on hypothetical use cases and market behaviors. In one scenario, XRP is adopted as a reserve asset for international payment settlements, which represent a $150 trillion annual market. Capturing just 1% of this total could elevate XRP’s market capitalization to $1.5 trillion, implying a price of $25.29 per token, based on a circulating supply of 59.3 billion XRP. Another projection centered on institutional demand. If Ripple’s strategic pivot attracts investment from financial institutions and corporations, similar to the Bitcoin buying trend seen in 2020–2021, XRP’s market cap could expand to $2.5 trillion, raising its price to $42.15. A more targeted model considered XRP being adopted as a replacement for nostro and vostro accounts, which collectively hold about $27 trillion. If XRP absorbs just 10% of this liquidity, it would bring $2.7 trillion into the XRP ecosystem, increasing the price to $45.53. In a conservative scenario, ChatGPT explored the impact of Ripple locking its entire 40.67 billion XRP reserve for a decade, removing future supply concerns. This action alone could strengthen investor confidence and drive the price from $3 to $6. Should market momentum increase due to ETF approvals or institutional endorsements, XRP’s market capitalization could reach $550 billion, pushing the price between $9.27 and $15. Google Gemini’s Conservative Estimates Google Gemini offered more measured projections. If Ripple were to permanently withhold its XRP reserves from circulation, the price could rise to $5.06, assuming the market sustains a valuation of $300 billion but is now spread across a smaller available supply. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Gemini also examined the effect of market sentiment, similar to Strategy’s influence on Bitcoin. If Ripple is perceived as a dedicated treasury entity and receives a 50% valuation premium, XRP’s market cap could reach $450 billion. This would translate to a price of $4.50 if calculated against the full 100 billion XRP supply. In a highly bullish scenario, where XRP gains recognition as a scarce, institution-grade asset, Gemini projected that achieving half of Bitcoin’s $2.3 trillion market cap would place XRP at $11.50. Reaching parity with Bitcoin’s market cap would bring the price to approximately $23. Increasing Corporate Interest in XRP Treasuries Beyond Ripple, several companies are already implementing XRP-focused treasury strategies. Nature’s Miracle Holding Inc. recently announced a plan to invest $20 million in XRP. Trident Digital Tech Holdings committed $500 million, and Webus International allocated $300 million. Additional participants include VivoPower International and Wellgistics Health. This broader trend has sparked conversations among industry leaders. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has questioned whether Ripple might soon formalize its role as an XRP treasury company. He also suggested that a wider corporate movement toward holding XRP could reduce the circulating supply and contribute to upward price pressure. Ripple’s potential shift to a treasury-centered strategy could redefine XRP’s role in both corporate finance and global payments. Whether through institutional adoption, reserve accumulation, or market scarcity, the strategic implications are significant. While forecasts vary, the overall outlook suggests that such a transition would likely support a substantial increase in XRP’s valuation, especially if market confidence continues to grow.

Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker, recently reported a monumental movement of 200,000,000 XRP from an unknown wallet directly to Ripple. This transaction, valued at approximately $592 million at the time, raises important questions about its purpose and potential impact on the XRP ecosystem. Understanding such large-scale movements is crucial for anyone following the digital asset space. Understanding the Scale of This XRP Transfer When an XRP transfer of this magnitude occurs, it is natural for the community to seek clarity. A transfer of 200 million XRP is not an everyday event. It signifies a major move by a large holder, often referred to as a ‘whale’, or an entity with significant reserves. The recipient, Ripple, adds another layer of intrigue, given its central role in the XRP Ledger and its ongoing operations. To put this into perspective, consider these points: Volume: 200 million XRP represents a substantial portion of the circulating supply, making its movement noteworthy. Value: At nearly $600 million, this transaction highlights the immense capital flowing within the crypto market, even during periods of volatility. Recipient: The fact that the XRP moved directly to Ripple suggests an internal or strategic purpose rather than a typical exchange deposit or individual transfer. Why Would Such a Large XRP Transfer Occur? Large XRP transfer events like this can stem from various strategic reasons. While the exact intent behind this particular movement remains undisclosed, we can explore several common possibilities that drive such significant on-chain activity. These reasons often relate to Ripple’s operational needs, market strategies, or broader ecosystem developments. Potential Reason Explanation Treasury Management Ripple holds a significant amount of XRP in escrow and operational wallets. This could be a movement for internal accounting or rebalancing. On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) XRP is used for ODL, facilitating cross-border payments. Ripple might be moving funds to service new corridors or increase liquidity for partners. Institutional Sales/Partnerships Ripple periodically sells XRP to institutional buyers. This transfer could precede or follow such a strategic sale. Ecosystem Development Funds might be allocated for grants, investments in new projects, or development initiatives within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. What Are the Implications of This XRP Transfer for the Market? Every major XRP transfer is scrutinized for its potential market implications. While a large transfer to Ripple might not immediately signal a price surge or crash, it does contribute to the overall market narrative and sentiment. The key is to distinguish between transfers that could lead to selling pressure (e.g., to an exchange) versus those that suggest internal or strategic use by Ripple. For this specific transfer to Ripple, some potential implications include: Increased Liquidity: If the XRP is intended for ODL, it could enhance liquidity for cross-border payments, potentially strengthening XRP’s utility. Market Confidence: Movements that appear to be for internal or strategic purposes, rather than immediate sale, can be viewed positively, indicating ongoing operations and development. Transparency Debate: While Whale Alert provides transparency on the movement itself, the lack of a stated reason can fuel speculation, highlighting the ongoing discussion around transparency in large crypto holdings. Navigating the World of Whale Movements: Actionable Insights For investors and enthusiasts, observing large XRP transfer events is part of understanding market dynamics. While it is important not to overreact to every single transaction, consistent patterns or transfers to specific types of wallets (e.g., known exchange wallets) can offer clues about potential market shifts. Always conduct your own research and consider the broader context of the market and Ripple’s ongoing developments. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Reputable Sources: Rely on services like Whale Alert for accurate transaction data. Context is Key: Understand whether the transfer is to an exchange, a known company wallet, or an unknown address. The destination often reveals more about the intent. Long-Term Perspective: Single large transfers rarely dictate long-term price trends. Focus on fundamental developments, regulatory news, and adoption rates. Risk Management: Never invest more than you are willing to lose, and diversify your portfolio. In conclusion, the recent 200 million XRP transfer to Ripple is a significant event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While its precise purpose remains undisclosed, such movements are typically tied to Ripple’s strategic operations, whether for liquidity, treasury management, or ecosystem development. Monitoring these large transactions provides valuable insights into the flow of digital assets and helps observers understand the broader landscape of the XRP Ledger. As the crypto space continues to evolve, staying informed about these key on-chain activities remains essential for both seasoned participants and newcomers alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a large XRP transfer mean for its price? A large XRP transfer, especially one to Ripple, does not automatically guarantee a price increase or decrease. Its impact depends on the purpose of the transfer. If it’s for ODL or internal management, it might be neutral or positive. If it signals an impending sale, it could lead to selling pressure. Who is ‘Whale Alert’ and why is it important? Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various networks. It’s important because it provides transparency on significant movements, helping the community identify potential market-moving activities by large holders. Does Ripple regularly move large amounts of XRP? Yes, Ripple regularly moves significant amounts of XRP as part of its operations, including releasing XRP from escrow for operational expenses, facilitating On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services, and engaging in institutional sales. These movements are often predictable or part of their stated strategies. How can I track large XRP transfers myself? You can track large XRP transfers by following blockchain analytics services like Whale Alert on social media or using blockchain explorers for the XRP Ledger (e.g., Bithomp, XRPScan) to monitor specific addresses known to hold large amounts of XRP or associated with Ripple. Is this XRP transfer a sign of market manipulation? Not necessarily. While large transfers can sometimes be associated with market manipulation, a transfer directly to Ripple is more likely to be part of its legitimate business operations or treasury management. It is crucial to look at the context and the recipient of the funds before drawing conclusions about manipulation. Did you find this article insightful?

This move, reported by the popular blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, isn’t just a technical detail; it carries substantial implications for the XRP ecosystem and the broader digital asset market. For those following the journey of XRP, understanding the mechanics and strategic intent behind such large amounts of XRP locked away is crucial. What Does 500 Million XRP Locked Really Mean? When we talk about 500 million XRP locked, we are referring to Ripple’s unique escrow system. This system is a core component of Ripple’s strategy to manage the supply of XRP. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that rely solely on mining or pre-defined emission schedules, Ripple proactively uses smart contracts to lock up the vast majority of its XRP holdings. Here’s a breakdown of how this mechanism works: Scheduled Releases: Ripple periodically locks large amounts of XRP into cryptographic escrow accounts. These funds are set to be released on a predetermined schedule, typically one billion XRP per month. Smart Contract Enforcement: The release schedule is enforced by smart contracts on the XRP Ledger, meaning the funds cannot be accessed or moved by Ripple until the designated time. This provides transparency and predictability. Purpose of Released Funds: Once released, Ripple uses these XRP for various purposes, including funding partnerships, supporting the XRP ecosystem, and selling a portion to cover operational costs or to foster liquidity for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. Any unused XRP from a monthly release is typically re-locked into a new escrow contract. The recent report of 500 million XRP locked is part of this ongoing, scheduled process, demonstrating Ripple’s consistent adherence to its supply management strategy. Why Is So Much XRP Locked? Ripple’s Strategic Vision The decision to keep a substantial portion of XRP locked in escrow is not arbitrary; it’s a deliberate strategic move by Ripple. This approach aims to achieve several key objectives that benefit both the company and the XRP community. Strategic Objective Explanation Supply Predictability By locking up a significant amount of XRP, Ripple provides a predictable supply schedule. This reduces uncertainty for investors and partners, as they know exactly how much XRP will enter circulation over time. Price Stability A controlled release mechanism helps mitigate sudden large influxes of XRP into the market, which could otherwise lead to significant price volatility. This fosters a more stable environment for XRP. Building Confidence The escrow system demonstrates Ripple’s long-term commitment to the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem. It signals that Ripple is not looking to “dump” its holdings but rather to grow the utility and adoption of XRP responsibly. Ecosystem Development The released XRP funds are vital for Ripple to invest in new projects, support developers, and forge strategic partnerships that expand the use cases for XRP, particularly in cross-border payments. Essentially, the vast amount of XRP locked serves as a transparent commitment to the market, signaling a measured and responsible approach to managing a digital asset designed for global utility. How Does XRP Locked Impact Market Dynamics? The act of 500 million XRP locked, and the broader escrow system, significantly influences XRP’s market dynamics. It’s a key factor that differentiates XRP from many other cryptocurrencies and impacts how investors perceive its value proposition. Reduced Circulating Supply: While the total supply of XRP is fixed at 100 billion, the amount of XRP in active circulation is much lower due to the escrow. This controlled circulating supply can influence its scarcity and, by extension, its market price. Investor Sentiment: For many investors, the escrow provides a degree of reassurance. It suggests a more controlled supply environment compared to projects where large insider holdings could be sold off at any time without notice. This can foster positive long-term sentiment. Transparency and Predictability: The public nature of the escrow contracts and the predictable release schedule allow market participants to anticipate supply changes. This transparency helps in fundamental analysis and reduces speculative shocks related to unexpected supply increases. However, it is also true that each monthly unlock event can create a moment of market anticipation. While the majority of released XRP is often re-locked, the portion sold by Ripple is still a supply addition that the market absorbs. Challenges and Criticisms of XRP Locked Escrow While the escrow system offers clear benefits, it is not without its critics or challenges. Understanding these perspectives is essential for a balanced view of XRP’s market position. Centralization Concerns: One of the primary criticisms is that the escrow system, and Ripple’s large holdings of XRP, suggest a degree of centralization. Critics argue that Ripple retains significant control over the supply, which some see as contrary to the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies. Market Pressure During Unlocks: Although designed for predictability, the monthly release of one billion XRP can still be viewed by some as a potential source of selling pressure. Even if a large portion is re-locked, the availability of new XRP on the market can be a point of discussion among traders. Perception of Control: The fact that Ripple controls the release schedule and the subsequent use of the released XRP leads to debates about the true “decentralization” of XRP. While the XRP Ledger itself is decentralized, Ripple’s influence over the asset’s supply remains a key point of contention for some. These challenges highlight the ongoing dialogue within the crypto community about the balance between controlled supply management and decentralized governance. The locking of 500 million XRP is a testament to Ripple’s ongoing strategy in this regard. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for XRP Holders For individuals holding or considering investing in XRP, understanding the escrow mechanism and the implications of large amounts of XRP locked is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Escrow Releases: Keep an eye on reports from services like Whale Alert for announcements regarding XRP locked and unlocked amounts. While predictable, these events are part of the market’s supply dynamics. Understand Ripple’s Strategy: Recognize that Ripple uses the released XRP to fund its operations and grow the XRP ecosystem. This is part of a long-term strategy to increase XRP’s utility and adoption, which could ultimately benefit its value. Focus on Utility and Adoption: Beyond the supply mechanics, evaluate XRP based on its fundamental utility, particularly its role in cross-border payments through On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). Increased adoption of ODL could be a more significant driver of value than short-term supply fluctuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: As with any cryptocurrency, it is wise to diversify your investment portfolio. While XRP offers unique advantages, a balanced approach can mitigate risks associated with single-asset exposure. The continued locking of significant amounts of XRP underscores Ripple’s commitment to its long-term vision. By staying informed and adopting a strategic perspective, XRP holders can better navigate the evolving landscape. Conclusion: The Enduring Significance of XRP Locked Funds The recent report of 500 million XRP locked in Ripple’s escrow system is a routine yet profoundly significant event. It serves as a powerful reminder of Ripple’s methodical approach to managing the supply of XRP, aiming for stability, predictability, and ecosystem growth. While the escrow system has its critics, it undoubtedly plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s market dynamics and investor perception. For the XRP community, these locked funds represent not just a numerical value, but a strategic lever wielded by Ripple to foster the long-term utility and adoption of XRP in the global financial landscape. Understanding the intricacies of XRP locked in escrow is key to grasping the full potential and trajectory of this prominent digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the purpose of Ripple locking XRP in escrow? A1: Ripple locks XRP in escrow primarily to manage its supply, ensure predictability, and foster stability in the market. It also provides funds for ecosystem development, partnerships, and operational costs in a controlled manner. Q2: How much XRP is currently locked in escrow? A2: While the exact real-time figure fluctuates, Ripple typically holds tens of billions of XRP in escrow. The recent report highlighted 500 million XRP locked as part of its ongoing, scheduled escrow releases and re-locks. Q3: Does the monthly release of XRP from escrow affect its price? A3: The monthly release of 1 billion XRP from escrow can create market anticipation. While a significant portion is often re-locked, the amount sold by Ripple does add to the circulating supply, which some market participants consider when evaluating price action. However, its overall impact is often balanced by demand from ODL and ecosystem growth. Q4: Is the XRP escrow system transparent? A4: Yes, the XRP escrow system is transparent. The smart contracts governing the releases are on the public XRP Ledger, allowing anyone to verify the amounts locked and the scheduled release dates. Blockchain tracking services like Whale Alert also regularly report on these movements. Q5: Why doesn’t Ripple release all its XRP at once? A5: Releasing all its XRP at once would flood the market, causing extreme price volatility and potentially devaluing the asset significantly. The controlled escrow mechanism ensures a gradual, predictable supply, supporting long-term growth and utility rather than short-term speculation. Q6: Does the XRP locked system make XRP centralized? A6: This is a debated point. While the XRP Ledger itself is decentralized, Ripple’s large holdings and control over the escrow release schedule lead some critics to argue it introduces a degree of centralization in terms of supply management. Proponents argue it’s a necessary step for ecosystem development and stability for a utility-focused asset. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

This isn’t just a random event; it’s a planned action that underscores the strategic importance of XRP escrow within the broader digital asset ecosystem. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, understanding what XRP escrow entails and its implications is crucial. What is XRP Escrow and Why Does it Matter? To grasp the significance of Ripple locking up 100 million XRP, we first need to understand the concept of escrow. In traditional finance, escrow is a legal arrangement where a third party temporarily holds assets or money until specific conditions are met. In the cryptocurrency world, this concept is often replicated through smart contracts, which automatically manage and release funds based on predefined rules. For XRP, Ripple utilizes an on-ledger escrow system. This means a portion of their XRP holdings is locked on the XRP Ledger itself, making the terms of release transparent and auditable. But why does this matter for XRP escrow ? Predictable Supply: The primary reason for XRP escrow is to create a predictable supply schedule. Without it, Ripple, as a major holder of XRP, could theoretically flood the market, causing volatility. Market Stability: By locking up a significant portion of XRP, Ripple aims to foster market stability and reduce uncertainty among investors about future supply. Transparency: The on-ledger nature of the escrow provides a high degree of transparency, allowing anyone to verify the locked amounts and release schedules. How Does Ripple Utilize XRP Escrow for Stability? The story of XRP escrow truly began in December 2017 when Ripple announced it had placed 55 billion XRP (out of its total holdings of 80 billion at the time) into a series of cryptographically secured escrow accounts. This monumental move was a direct response to concerns about the company’s large holdings and their potential impact on market dynamics. The mechanism is straightforward: 1 billion XRP is released from escrow on the first day of each month. Ripple then has the option to sell a portion of this released XRP to fund its operations, invest in the XRP ecosystem, or support its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors. Any XRP not sold or used by Ripple during that month is then placed back into a new escrow account, effectively extending the lockup period. This ensures that the circulating supply of XRP remains controlled and predictable. This systematic approach demonstrates Ripple’s commitment to the long-term health of the XRP ecosystem, providing a clear roadmap for supply management. The 100 million XRP recently reported by Whale Alert as locked back into escrow is a perfect example of this ongoing, cyclical process. Escrow Metric Details Initial Escrow Amount (2017) 55 Billion XRP Monthly Release 1 Billion XRP Unused XRP Action Returned to Escrow Purpose of Escrow Predictable Supply & Market Stability The Impact of XRP Escrow on Market Dynamics: What Should Investors Know? The existence and operation of XRP escrow have a multifaceted impact on the market. For investors, understanding these dynamics is key to making informed decisions. Reduced FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): Before escrow, there was considerable speculation and fear about Ripple potentially selling off vast amounts of XRP, which could depress its price. The escrow mechanism significantly mitigates this FUD by providing a clear, predictable release schedule. Investor Confidence: The transparency and predictability offered by XRP escrow tend to build investor confidence. Knowing that supply is managed systematically helps in long-term planning and reduces the perceived risk of sudden, large market dumps. Price Implications: While a monthly release of 1 billion XRP might seem large, the market has generally become accustomed to it. The actual impact on price often depends on market demand, Ripple’s sales strategy, and overall crypto market sentiment. When Ripple returns unsold XRP to escrow, it can be seen as a positive signal, as it means less new supply is entering circulation than the maximum possible. Centralization Debate: It’s important to acknowledge that some critics view Ripple’s significant control over XRP through escrow as a form of centralization, contrasting with the decentralized ethos of many cryptocurrencies. However, proponents argue it’s a necessary step for managing a digital asset designed for enterprise adoption and cross-border payments. Beyond the Headlines: Understanding Ripple’s XRP Escrow Strategy The strategic intent behind XRP escrow goes beyond mere price stability. It’s deeply intertwined with Ripple’s broader vision for XRP and the XRP Ledger. Ripple positions XRP as a bridge currency for global payments, particularly through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which leverages XRP for instant and low-cost cross-border transactions. The XRP released from escrow is crucial for several aspects of Ripple’s business strategy: Funding Operations: A portion of the released XRP is sold to fund Ripple’s ongoing research, development, and operational costs. Ecosystem Development: Ripple uses XRP to incentivize developers, fund new projects built on the XRP Ledger, and support partnerships that expand the utility of XRP. ODL Growth: Perhaps most importantly, released XRP is used to provide liquidity for ODL corridors, ensuring that financial institutions can easily convert between fiat currencies and XRP for efficient cross-border settlements. The lockup of 100 million XRP back into escrow signals that Ripple is managing its assets carefully, only drawing what is needed and returning the rest, reinforcing the long-term sustainability of their supply management strategy. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for XRP Escrow? The XRP escrow mechanism is designed to continue for many years, given the vast amount of XRP still locked away. As Ripple continues to push for greater adoption of XRP and its ODL solutions, the role of escrow will remain vital. The market will continue to observe the monthly releases and Ripple’s subsequent actions regarding the unsold XRP. The future of XRP escrow will likely be influenced by several factors: Regulatory Clarity: As the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies evolves globally, especially in key markets, it could impact how Ripple manages its XRP holdings and sales. XRP Adoption Rate: Increased adoption of XRP for payments and other use cases would naturally increase demand, potentially making the monthly releases easier for the market to absorb without significant price pressure. Broader Crypto Market Trends: Like all digital assets, XRP’s performance and the market’s reaction to escrow releases will always be influenced by the overall sentiment and trends in the wider cryptocurrency market. The ongoing management of XRP escrow by Ripple is a transparent, long-term strategy that aims to balance supply with demand, support ecosystem growth, and provide predictability for investors. It’s a key pillar of the XRP ecosystem’s structure. In conclusion, the news of 100 million XRP being locked back into escrow by Ripple, as reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a data point; it’s a reaffirmation of a well-established and strategic mechanism. XRP escrow is a fundamental component of Ripple’s plan to manage XRP supply, foster market stability, and support the widespread adoption of its digital asset for global payments. It offers transparency and predictability, which are invaluable in the often-volatile cryptocurrency space. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding this ongoing process is crucial to comprehending the long-term vision and operational integrity of the XRP ecosystem.

The company, majority-owned by former U.S. President Donald Trump and operator of the Truth Social platform, reported an astounding 800% year-over-year increase in its financial assets for the second quarter. This monumental leap was largely attributed to a bold and strategic embrace of digital assets, specifically a robust Bitcoin strategy . For those closely watching the intersection of technology, media, and digital currency, TMTG’s move represents a significant moment. It underscores a growing trend where established entities are exploring the potential of cryptocurrencies not just as an investment, but as a core component of their treasury management. This aggressive adoption of a Bitcoin strategy has not only bolstered TMTG’s balance sheet but also ignited discussions about the future of corporate finance in an increasingly digital economy. What is the Bitcoin Strategy Behind Trump Media’s Massive Growth? The core of Trump Media & Technology Group’s recent financial success lies in its proactive and substantial investment in Bitcoin. According to an August 1 press release via GlobeNewswire, the company concluded the second quarter with approximately $3.1 billion in financial assets. This figure marks an extraordinary increase, primarily fueled by a strategic initiative to raise capital specifically for a Bitcoin strategy . The firm successfully raised nearly $2.4 billion, earmarking these funds to build a formidable digital asset treasury. In July alone, this strategic allocation enabled TMTG to stockpile an impressive sum of around $2 billion worth of Bitcoin and related securities. This wasn’t merely a speculative play but a calculated decision to integrate a significant portion of its financial holdings into the leading cryptocurrency. This Bitcoin strategy reflects a growing confidence among some corporations in the long-term value and utility of digital assets. By converting a substantial portion of its capital into Bitcoin, TMTG aimed to: Diversify its treasury assets: Moving beyond traditional fiat currencies and securities. Hedge against inflation: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Capitalize on potential growth: Positioning the company to benefit from the future appreciation of Bitcoin. Signal innovation: Demonstrating a forward-thinking approach to financial management. How Did This Bitcoin Strategy Impact Financial Assets? The impact of TMTG’s Bitcoin strategy on its financial assets is nothing short of dramatic. The 800% year-over-year increase in financial assets translates into billions of dollars added to the company’s balance sheet. To put this into perspective, if TMTG’s financial assets were roughly $3.1 billion in the second quarter, an 800% increase means they started the previous year with approximately $344 million. The nearly $2 billion in Bitcoin and related securities acquired in July alone accounts for a significant portion of this growth. Let’s look at the financial shift more clearly: Metric Q2 Previous Year (Estimated) Q2 Current Year (Post-Bitcoin Strategy) Change Financial Assets ~$344 Million ~$3.1 Billion ~800% Increase Bitcoin & Securities Holdings $0 ~$2 Billion N/A (New Holding) This table illustrates the profound impact of the company’s aggressive digital asset acquisition. While the press release specifically mentions the Q2 financial assets and the July acquisition of Bitcoin, it is clear that the funds raised for the Bitcoin strategy were the primary catalyst for this unprecedented growth. What Does This Bitcoin Strategy Mean for Corporate Adoption? Trump Media’s significant dive into Bitcoin treasury management is not an isolated event, but it certainly stands out due to the sheer scale and the high-profile nature of the company. It adds considerable weight to the argument for corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies. For years, companies like MicroStrategy have championed a Bitcoin strategy , accumulating vast amounts of the digital asset. TMTG’s move could serve as a powerful signal to other traditional companies that are still on the fence about incorporating digital assets into their balance sheets. When a company operating in the media and technology sector, with strong political ties, makes such a bold financial decision, it can: Increase mainstream legitimacy: Further normalize Bitcoin as a viable corporate asset. Encourage further exploration: Prompt other CFOs and treasury managers to seriously evaluate a Bitcoin strategy . Influence investor sentiment: Potentially attracting investors who value exposure to the digital asset space. This development suggests that the trend of companies holding Bitcoin as part of their treasury is evolving from a niche strategy adopted by early movers to a more broadly considered financial maneuver. It highlights a shift in perception, where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Strategy While the rewards of a successful Bitcoin strategy can be substantial, as demonstrated by TMTG, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks involved. Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, is known for its price volatility. Its value can fluctuate significantly in short periods, which can impact a company’s balance sheet both positively and negatively. Key considerations for any company contemplating a similar Bitcoin strategy include: Market Volatility: The price of Bitcoin can be highly unpredictable, leading to potential impairments if its value drops. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing uncertainties regarding future compliance and taxation. Custody and Security: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting standards often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, which can lead to complex impairment charges if its value declines. Public Perception: Adopting a Bitcoin strategy can expose a company to public scrutiny and potential criticism, depending on market sentiment and political views on cryptocurrencies. Despite these challenges, TMTG’s decision underscores a calculated risk-reward assessment, betting on the long-term appreciation and strategic value of Bitcoin within its corporate portfolio. Actionable Insights from Trump Media’s Bitcoin Strategy For businesses and investors observing TMTG’s remarkable financial transformation, several actionable insights emerge regarding the implementation and potential of a Bitcoin strategy : Strategic Capital Allocation: TMTG explicitly raised capital to fund its Bitcoin acquisition, rather than simply converting existing reserves. This highlights the importance of a deliberate and planned approach to integrating digital assets. Long-Term Vision: While short-term gains are possible, a substantial Bitcoin strategy is typically underpinned by a long-term belief in the asset’s store-of-value proposition and its role in the future financial system. Diversification Benefits: For companies with significant cash reserves, Bitcoin can offer a diversification tool that may perform differently from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk in certain economic conditions. Early Mover Advantage (Still): While corporate adoption is growing, it’s still relatively early. Companies that establish a thoughtful Bitcoin strategy now might gain a competitive edge in attracting a new generation of investors and talent familiar with digital assets. Robust Risk Management: Any significant crypto holding necessitates robust risk management frameworks, including secure custody solutions, clear policies for price fluctuations, and an understanding of the evolving regulatory landscape. Trump Media’s experience offers a compelling case study for how a bold Bitcoin strategy , when executed with significant capital, can dramatically reshape a company’s financial standing and market perception. Conclusion: A New Era for Corporate Finance and Bitcoin Strategy Trump Media & Technology Group’s astonishing 800% asset surge, driven by its aggressive Bitcoin strategy , marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance. This move, which saw the company amass billions in Bitcoin, not only transformed its balance sheet but also sent a clear signal about the growing confidence in cryptocurrency as a legitimate and powerful treasury asset. While the path of a Bitcoin strategy is not without its complexities and risks, TMTG’s success story provides a compelling example of the potential rewards. It highlights a future where companies, both large and small, may increasingly look to digital assets as a cornerstone of their financial health and innovation. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the strategic adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will undoubtedly remain a topic of intense interest and significant opportunity for businesses worldwide.

It means that, for the time being, Bitcoin is largely outperforming the majority of alternative cryptocurrencies. This shift in market dynamics has profound implications for how investors approach their portfolios, emphasizing the importance of informed decisions during a prevailing Bitcoin Season. Let us delve deeper into what this index truly represents and how you can navigate the current market conditions. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 37 Really Mean for Altcoin Season? To truly grasp the current state of the market, it is essential to understand the mechanics behind the Altcoin Season Index. This valuable metric, provided by CoinMarketCap, offers a clear snapshot of market sentiment and performance trends. It specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing purely on the organic performance of leading digital assets. The index evaluates the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days, comparing their gains against Bitcoin. The score, ranging from 1 to 100, indicates the proportion of these altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin during that period. Here is a breakdown of what the scores typically signify: Altcoin Season Index Score Market Condition Interpretation 75-100 Altcoin Season At least 75% of top 100 altcoins outperformed Bitcoin. 26-74 Neither Altcoin nor Bitcoin Season Mixed performance; no clear dominance. 1-25 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer of top 100 altcoins outperformed Bitcoin. With the index currently at 37, it falls squarely within the ‘Bitcoin Season’ category, as 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This metric provides valuable insight into the prevailing market sentiment and where capital is currently flowing. Why Are We in Bitcoin Season and Not Altcoin Season? Factors Driving Dominance The shift from a potential Altcoin Season to a period of Bitcoin dominance is rarely arbitrary. Several interconnected factors often contribute to Bitcoin strengthening its position in the broader crypto market. Understanding these drivers is key to anticipating future market movements and adapting your investment approach. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability, investors often seek safer, more established assets. Bitcoin, increasingly viewed as ‘digital gold’ or a store of value, tends to attract capital during such periods, as traditional markets face headwinds. This flight to quality strengthens Bitcoin’s position relative to more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest and Adoption: Growing institutional involvement, particularly with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing corporate treasury allocations, funnels significant capital directly into Bitcoin. This large-scale investment can disproportionately impact Bitcoin’s price and market capitalization, leading to increased dominance. Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, periods leading up to and immediately following a Bitcoin halving event often see increased attention and price appreciation for Bitcoin. The reduced supply issuance creates scarcity, which can draw capital away from altcoins as investors position themselves for potential Bitcoin rallies. Liquidity Concentration: During phases of market uncertainty or consolidation, liquidity tends to flow into the largest and most liquid asset, which is Bitcoin. Smaller altcoins may struggle to attract significant capital, leading to underperformance compared to Bitcoin. Reduced Risk Appetite: When market sentiment is cautious, investors tend to reduce their exposure to higher-risk assets like many altcoins. They prefer the relative stability and larger market cap of Bitcoin, further contributing to Bitcoin Season. These factors collectively create an environment where Bitcoin’s performance overshadows that of most altcoins, pushing the Altcoin Season Index lower and cementing the current Bitcoin Season. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies for Crypto Investors During Altcoin Season’s Pause While the current market indicates a Bitcoin Season, it does not mean altcoins are irrelevant. Instead, it calls for a refined investment strategy. Understanding how to navigate these periods is crucial for protecting capital and positioning for future growth, especially when considering the eventual return of an Altcoin Season. Focus on Blue-Chip Altcoins: During Bitcoin Season, many smaller, less established altcoins may struggle. Investors might consider consolidating holdings into larger, more established altcoins with strong fundamentals, proven use cases, and robust development teams. These ‘blue-chip’ altcoins often demonstrate greater resilience and tend to recover faster when market sentiment shifts. Accumulation and Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): A Bitcoin Season can present an opportunity to accumulate quality altcoins at potentially lower prices. Implementing a dollar-cost averaging strategy allows you to buy a fixed dollar amount of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This reduces the risk of buying at a single peak and can be particularly effective during periods of consolidation or decline. Risk Management and Portfolio Rebalancing: It is wise to review your portfolio’s risk exposure. If your portfolio is heavily weighted towards highly volatile altcoins, consider rebalancing to increase your Bitcoin holdings or stablecoin reserves. This can help mitigate potential losses during a Bitcoin-dominant phase and prepare for the next Altcoin Season. Deep Dive into Research: Use this period to conduct thorough due diligence on potential altcoin investments. Look beyond price action and examine projects’ technology, team, tokenomics, community, and real-world utility. Strong fundamentals are often what allow projects to survive and thrive through various market cycles. Patience and Long-Term Vision: Crypto markets are inherently cyclical. While we are in a Bitcoin Season now, history suggests that an Altcoin Season will eventually follow. Maintaining a long-term perspective and avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements is a prudent approach. By adopting these strategies, investors can not only safeguard their portfolios but also position themselves advantageously for when the market eventually shifts back towards an Altcoin Season. A Look Back: Historical Altcoin Season Trends and Patterns Understanding the current Altcoin Season Index of 37 is made clearer by examining historical market patterns. The crypto market has a distinct cyclical nature, with periods of Bitcoin dominance often followed by surges in altcoin performance, and vice versa. Recognizing these past trends can provide valuable context for present conditions. Notable Altcoin Seasons have occurred multiple times throughout crypto history. For instance, 2017 saw an explosion in altcoin valuations, with many projects achieving unprecedented gains. Similarly, early 2021 witnessed another significant Altcoin Season, driven by DeFi and NFT narratives, where numerous altcoins far outpaced Bitcoin’s returns. These periods typically occur after Bitcoin has had a strong rally and then enters a consolidation phase, allowing capital to flow into smaller, higher-risk assets in search of greater returns. Conversely, Bitcoin Seasons often emerge during times of market uncertainty, regulatory crackdowns, or when Bitcoin embarks on a strong, sustained bull run, drawing liquidity away from altcoins. The current Altcoin Season Index at 37 reflects one such period where Bitcoin’s performance is commanding the market’s attention. The key takeaway from historical data is that these market conditions are not permanent. The crypto market operates in cycles, and understanding these ebbs and flows is fundamental to successful long-term investing. The current Bitcoin Season is part of this larger, cyclical narrative. When Will the Next Altcoin Season Emerge? Future Outlook and Triggers The million-dollar question for many investors is: when will the current Bitcoin Season subside, paving the way for the next Altcoin Season? While no one can predict the future with certainty, several potential triggers and indicators could signal a shift in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Stability and Consolidation: Often, a strong Altcoin Season follows a period where Bitcoin’s price has stabilized or entered a consolidation phase after a significant rally. This allows investors to feel more comfortable taking on higher risk, shifting capital into altcoins. New Narratives and Technological Breakthroughs: The emergence of compelling new narratives (e.g., Layer 2 solutions, GameFi, AI tokens, Real World Assets) or significant technological advancements within the altcoin space can attract fresh capital and ignite an Altcoin Season. These innovations often create excitement and drive speculative interest. Regulatory Clarity: Positive regulatory developments, particularly in major jurisdictions, can boost confidence across the entire crypto market. This increased certainty can encourage broader investment, including into altcoins, as perceived risks decrease. Increased Retail Participation: A surge in retail investor interest often plays a significant role in fueling an Altcoin Season. As new money enters the market, it tends to flow into easily accessible and often lower-priced altcoins, driving up their valuations. Decreased Bitcoin Dominance: A consistent decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance, as measured by the Bitcoin Dominance chart, is a strong indicator that capital is flowing out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, setting the stage for an Altcoin Season. Monitoring these factors, alongside the Altcoin Season Index itself, can provide valuable clues about the potential timing of the next major altcoin rally. While the current index of 37 points to Bitcoin dominance, the market is always in flux. Actionable Insights for Thriving in Any Crypto Season, Including Altcoin Season Regardless of whether the market is in a Bitcoin Season or an Altcoin Season, adopting a disciplined and informed approach is paramount for long-term success. The current Altcoin Season Index at 37 underscores the need for strategic thinking. Diversification, With Caution: While tempting to go all-in on the perceived winning side, a balanced portfolio that includes both Bitcoin and a selection of well-researched altcoins can help mitigate risk. Avoid over-diversification into too many speculative assets. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto market moves quickly. Continuously educating yourself on market trends, technological developments, and macroeconomic factors is crucial. Be prepared to adapt your strategy as market conditions, indicated by metrics like the Altcoin Season Index, evolve. Emotional Discipline: Market cycles can be emotionally taxing. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed. Stick to your investment plan and remember that short-term fluctuations are normal. Long-Term Perspective: For many, the most successful approach to crypto investing is a long-term one. Focusing on the fundamental value and long-term potential of projects, rather than short-term price swings, can lead to greater returns over time, irrespective of whether it’s Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season. Consider Profit Taking: During strong bull runs, whether for Bitcoin or altcoins, it can be prudent to take some profits to secure gains and de-risk your portfolio. This allows you to have capital available for future opportunities or to weather potential downturns. By integrating these actionable insights into your investment framework, you can navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater confidence and increase your chances of achieving your financial goals, no matter the prevailing market season. Conclusion: Preparing for the Evolving Crypto Landscape and the Next Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index at 37 serves as a vital reminder that the cryptocurrency market is constantly in motion, with periods of Bitcoin dominance and Altcoin Season naturally cycling. Understanding these phases, their underlying drivers, and their implications for your portfolio is not just about identifying trends; it is about empowering yourself to make informed, strategic decisions. While the current market favors Bitcoin, history suggests that the pendulum will eventually swing back, creating new opportunities for altcoins. By staying informed, practicing disciplined investing, and adapting your strategies to the prevailing market conditions, you can confidently navigate the exciting yet volatile world of digital assets. The key is to recognize the signs, understand the cycles, and prepare for whatever the evolving crypto landscape brings next, including the eventual return of a vibrant Altcoin Season.

Recently, the vigilant blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a significant transaction: 100 million XRP has been locked into an escrow account at Ripple. This development isn’t just a number; it is a critical piece of information that profoundly impacts the understanding of XRP’s supply dynamics and Ripple’s strategic vision. For anyone invested in or simply observing the digital asset space, grasping the implications of this XRP escrow is essential. What Exactly is XRP Escrow and Why Does it Matter? At its core, XRP escrow refers to a cryptographic mechanism designed to lock up a certain amount of XRP, making it unavailable for circulation until a predetermined time or condition is met. Think of it as a digital time capsule for cryptocurrency. Ripple, the company behind the XRP Ledger, utilizes this system to manage the vast majority of its XRP holdings. This is not a new practice; it has been a foundational part of Ripple’s strategy since 2017 when they committed to placing 55 billion XRP into a series of escrows. The primary purpose of this strategic lock-up is to provide predictability and stability to the XRP market. By controlling the release of XRP into the circulating supply, Ripple aims to mitigate concerns about potential sudden market dumps and to signal a long-term commitment to the asset’s health and utility. It ensures that the market has a clear understanding of the maximum possible supply at any given time, fostering trust among investors and partners. How Does Ripple’s XRP Escrow System Function? Ripple’s XRP escrow system operates on the XRP Ledger itself, utilizing its native smart contract functionality. When XRP is placed into escrow, it is locked into individual accounts with specific release dates. Typically, these escrows are set up to release 1 billion XRP on the first day of each month. What happens to this released XRP is key to understanding the system’s effectiveness: Monthly Release: At the beginning of each month, 1 billion XRP becomes available from one of the pre-set escrows. Strategic Utilization: Ripple can then use this unlocked XRP for various purposes, including funding operations, supporting partnerships, or selling it to institutional clients. Re-escrowing Unused XRP: A crucial aspect of the system is that any XRP from the monthly release that is not used by Ripple is promptly placed back into new escrows, typically with new lock-up periods extending several years into the future. This practice ensures that the circulating supply does not grow uncontrollably and reinforces the commitment to a managed supply. This systematic approach provides a transparent and verifiable method for managing a significant portion of the XRP supply, directly addressing concerns about supply shocks that could impact market dynamics. The recent 100 million XRP lock-up reported by Whale Alert is a clear example of this re-escrowing process in action, demonstrating Ripple’s ongoing adherence to its stated policy. Escrow Action Purpose Market Impact Initial Lock-up (2017) Commit to controlled supply Increased confidence, reduced FUD Monthly Release (1 Billion XRP) Operational funding, partnerships Potential for minor selling pressure Re-escrowing Unused XRP Maintain managed supply, long-term stability Positive for supply predictability What Are the Benefits of XRP Escrow for the Ecosystem? The existence and consistent execution of the XRP escrow mechanism offer several compelling benefits that contribute to the overall health and perception of the XRP ecosystem: Enhanced Market Stability: By preventing a sudden influx of XRP into the market, escrow helps to smooth out supply dynamics. This reduces the likelihood of drastic price fluctuations due to uncontrolled supply increases, fostering a more stable trading environment. Increased Predictability: Investors and businesses can make more informed decisions knowing that the maximum circulating supply of XRP for any given period is transparently managed. This predictability is a significant advantage in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. Building Trust and Transparency: The on-chain verifiable nature of XRP escrow means anyone can confirm the locked funds. This transparency builds trust within the community and demonstrates Ripple’s commitment to responsible asset management. It counters narratives of uncontrolled supply. Signaling Long-Term Vision: The act of locking up such large quantities of XRP for years into the future sends a strong signal that Ripple is committed to the long-term success and utility of the XRP Ledger and the XRP asset. This can attract institutional interest and long-term holders. These benefits collectively contribute to a more mature and resilient market for XRP, positioning it favorably against other digital assets that may lack similar transparent supply management strategies. Are There Any Challenges or Criticisms Regarding XRP Escrow? While XRP escrow offers clear advantages, it has not been without its share of discussion and occasional criticism. One of the main points of contention often revolves around the perception of centralization. Since Ripple controls the majority of the XRP supply, even with escrow, some argue that it gives the company too much influence over the asset’s market. Critics sometimes point to the large monthly releases as a potential source of selling pressure, despite Ripple’s re-escrowing policy. Another area of discussion involves the regulatory landscape. The classification of XRP has been a subject of legal debate, and the existence of large corporate holdings and managed supply via escrow can sometimes be drawn into these discussions. However, Ripple maintains that the escrow mechanism is a tool for responsible management, not market manipulation, and is designed to foster a healthy ecosystem. It is important for market participants to weigh these perspectives. While the escrow provides predictability, the sheer volume of XRP held by Ripple and its associated entities remains a topic of ongoing interest and analysis within the broader crypto community. What Does This 100 Million XRP Escrow Mean for the Future of XRP? The recent report of 100 million XRP being locked back into XRP escrow is a powerful reaffirmation of Ripple’s consistent strategy. This event, far from being an isolated incident, fits perfectly within the established pattern of how Ripple manages its monthly unlocked XRP. When a portion of the monthly release is not utilized for operational expenses or strategic sales, it is promptly re-escrowed, effectively removing it from immediate circulation and extending its lock-up period. For the future of XRP, this adherence to the escrow mechanism reinforces several key aspects: Supply Predictability Remains Intact: It signals that Ripple continues to prioritize a predictable and managed supply schedule, which is crucial for maintaining market confidence and reducing speculative volatility tied to supply fears. Reinforced Investor Confidence: For investors, the re-escrowing of unused XRP is generally seen as a positive sign. It demonstrates that Ripple is not looking to flood the market with XRP but rather to ensure its controlled distribution over time, aligning with a long-term value proposition. Market Perception: Such actions contribute to a more mature perception of XRP as an asset with a clear, verifiable supply strategy, which can be appealing to institutional players seeking stability and transparency. Support for Price Stability: While not a direct price driver, the removal of XRP from immediate circulation through re-escrowing can indirectly support price stability by reducing potential selling pressure that a larger circulating supply might otherwise create. In essence, the 100 million XRP escrow is a routine but important reminder of the underlying mechanics that govern XRP’s supply. It underscores Ripple’s commitment to its established strategy, which aims to foster a stable and growing ecosystem for the digital asset. Actionable Insights for the XRP Community Understanding the dynamics of XRP escrow provides valuable insights for anyone involved with the asset. Here are some actionable takeaways: Stay Informed on Escrow Reports: Keep an eye on reports from blockchain trackers like Whale Alert. While individual re-escrows are part of the routine, understanding the overall flow of XRP into and out of escrow provides a clearer picture of supply. Focus on Utility and Adoption: While supply management is important, the long-term value of XRP will ultimately be driven by its utility and adoption in real-world use cases, particularly for cross-border payments and liquidity. Consider the Long-Term View: Ripple’s escrow strategy is inherently long-term. For investors, aligning with this perspective means focusing less on short-term price fluctuations and more on the fundamental developments and partnerships that leverage XRP. Engage with Data: Utilize on-chain data and analytics platforms to verify information about XRP supply and escrow movements, fostering a data-driven understanding of the asset. The recent 100 million XRP lock-up at Ripple, as reported by Whale Alert, is a routine yet significant event within the XRP ecosystem. It serves as a clear demonstration of Ripple’s ongoing commitment to its transparent and predictable XRP escrow strategy. This mechanism, designed to manage the circulating supply of XRP, plays a vital role in fostering market stability, enhancing predictability for investors, and building trust through its verifiable on-chain operations. While discussions around centralization persist, the consistent re-escrowing of unused XRP reinforces Ripple’s long-term vision for the asset. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the complexities of the cryptocurrency market and assessing the future trajectory of XRP. It highlights a disciplined approach to supply management that aims to support the asset’s utility and adoption over time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is XRP escrow?

Despite the recent dip, on-chain data suggests the uptrend may not be over. Glassnode’s latest analysis points to a potential new all-time high (ATH) of $4,900, fueled by bullish investor sentiment, growing ETF inflows, and rising open interest (OI) in futures markets. Glassnode Points to a $4,900 Ethereum Target According to Glassnode, Ethereum is trading near its March 2024 levels, yet unrealized profits remain comparatively lower. This divergence implies a large upside potential as investors are not yet cashing out, signaling confidence in further gains. The firm’s analysis shows that if unrealized profits reach the same levels as in 2024, ETH would likely climb toward $4,900, marking a new ATH and testing the critical psychological resistance at $5,000. This could reflect a growing shift in how investors treat Ethereum, from a speculative token to a core financial asset. ETH's price records a small decline on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Open Interest and ETF Demand Reinforce Bullish Outlook Rising open interest further supports Ethereum’s bullish case. Crypto futures data indicates that more traders are opening long positions on ETH, reflecting expectations of further upside. Ethereum’s OI has been a key contributor to the broader altcoin market rebound. Moreover, spot Ethereum ETFs, especially BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF, saw over $4 billion in inflows in July 2025, pushing total ETH ETF holdings to $21.85 billion.

This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the reality unfolding in the crypto world, specifically with a newly created address that has become a significant Ethereum whale . This mysterious entity has recently made headlines by accumulating a staggering amount of Ethereum, prompting widespread discussion and analysis across the blockchain community. Decoding the Ethereum Whale’s Latest Moves In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, large holders of digital assets are often referred to as ‘whales’ due to their ability to significantly influence market movements. Recently, an intriguing new Ethereum whale has emerged, making substantial acquisitions that have caught the eye of on-chain analysts. Just a few hours ago, this fresh wallet added another 16,495.15 ETH, valued at approximately $58.5 million, directly from Galaxy Digital. This single transaction is merely the latest in a series of colossal buys. Over the past three days, this same wallet has been on an unprecedented buying spree, accumulating a grand total of 79,461.38 ETH. At current market prices, this monumental accumulation is worth around $299 million. This level of rapid accumulation by a single entity is rare and signals a strong conviction in Ethereum’s future, or perhaps a strategic move that could impact the market. Interestingly, despite these massive purchases, the wallet is currently sitting on a floating loss of about $22.05 million, a common occurrence for large-scale entries in volatile markets. To put these figures into perspective, consider the following breakdown of the Ethereum whale ‘s recent activity: Transaction Type Ethereum (ETH) Acquired Approximate USD Value Timeframe Latest Single Acquisition 16,495.15 ETH $58.5 million Approx. 3 hours ago Total Recent Accumulation 79,461.38 ETH $299 million Over the past 3 days Current Floating Loss N/A ~$22.05 million As of analysis Why Do Ethereum Whales Matter to the Market? The actions of an Ethereum whale are not just fascinating; they hold significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Whales, by definition, possess enough capital to execute trades that can move market prices. Their large buy or sell orders can create ripples, or even waves, that affect every other participant. When a whale accumulates, it can signal confidence in an asset’s future price, potentially inspiring smaller investors to buy, thus driving prices up. Conversely, a whale’s decision to sell can trigger a downward spiral. Beyond direct price impact, whale activity also serves as a crucial sentiment indicator. If multiple whales begin accumulating, it often suggests a bullish outlook. If they start distributing their holdings, it might signal an impending downturn. This makes monitoring an Ethereum whale ‘s wallet movements a key part of on-chain analysis for many traders and investors. Understanding the Risks: Ethereum Whale Activity and Volatility While the accumulation by an Ethereum whale can be seen as a positive sign, it also introduces certain risks and contributes to market volatility. Here are a few points to consider: Market Manipulation Concerns: Large, coordinated buys or sells by whales can sometimes be perceived as attempts to manipulate the market, creating artificial demand or supply. Sudden Price Swings: The sudden liquidation of a large position by an Ethereum whale can lead to sharp price drops, impacting the portfolios of smaller holders. Liquidity Challenges: In less liquid markets, a whale’s actions can disproportionately affect price, making it harder for others to enter or exit positions at desired prices. Unpredictable Motives: The true intentions behind a whale’s moves are often unknown. Are they long-term holders, speculative traders, or institutional players executing specific strategies? This uncertainty adds a layer of risk. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights from Ethereum Whale Movements For everyday investors, understanding the movements of an Ethereum whale can provide valuable insights without necessarily requiring direct imitation. Here’s how you can leverage this information: Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools and platforms that track large wallet movements can provide early warnings or confirmations of market trends. Following reputable on-chain analysts, like @ai_9684xtpa mentioned in the initial report, can be highly beneficial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Even if an Ethereum whale is accumulating, market conditions can change rapidly. Diversification across different assets helps mitigate risk. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While whale activity can create short-term noise, always prioritize your investment decisions based on the fundamental strength and long-term potential of Ethereum and other assets. Set Clear Investment Strategies: Define your entry and exit points, and stick to them. Don’t let the excitement or fear generated by an Ethereum whale ‘s actions sway you from your predefined plan. The Future Trajectory of Ethereum Whale Accumulations What does this massive accumulation by an Ethereum whale suggest for the future? It could indicate a few scenarios. Firstly, it might be a significant institutional player entering the market, seeing long-term value in Ethereum’s ecosystem, particularly with its ongoing development and potential for increased adoption. Institutional interest often precedes periods of significant growth. Secondly, it could be a strategic move by a high-net-worth individual or fund anticipating a bullish turn for Ethereum, possibly in anticipation of upcoming upgrades or broader market recovery. Their current floating loss suggests they believe in a substantial future upside that will far outweigh this initial dip. Lastly, it highlights the increasing sophistication of market participants. The ability to accumulate such a large sum from a major player like Galaxy Digital indicates a planned, strategic approach rather than impulsive trading. The continued monitoring of this specific Ethereum whale wallet will undoubtedly provide further clues about its intentions and potential impact on Ethereum’s price trajectory. In conclusion, the emergence of a new Ethereum whale accumulating nearly $300 million in ETH over a short period is a significant event in the crypto landscape. While the immediate floating loss highlights the inherent volatility, the sheer scale of the accumulation underscores a strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. Understanding these colossal movements is crucial for anyone navigating the complex and exciting world of cryptocurrencies, offering a glimpse into the forces that shape market dynamics and investor sentiment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale? A1: An Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH), typically enough to influence market prices with their buy or sell orders. Q2: How do Ethereum whale movements affect the market? A2: When an Ethereum whale makes large transactions, it can cause significant price swings. Large purchases can drive prices up by increasing demand, while large sales can cause prices to drop by increasing supply. Q3: Is a floating loss a bad sign for the Ethereum whale? A3: Not necessarily. A floating loss means the current value of the asset is less than the purchase price. For a large investor like an Ethereum whale , this might be part of a long-term strategy, indicating they expect the price to recover and surpass their entry point over time. Q4: How can I track Ethereum whale activity? A4: You can track Ethereum whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms and by following reputable blockchain analysts on social media or news outlets. These sources often highlight significant transactions from large wallets. Q5: Should I invest based on Ethereum whale movements? A5: While whale movements can offer insights into market sentiment, it’s generally not advisable to base your entire investment strategy solely on them. Always conduct your own research, understand the fundamentals of the asset, and consider your own financial goals and risk tolerance.

This latest acquisition, valued at approximately $53 million, solidifies SharpLink Gaming’s position as a significant institutional holder of Ethereum, underscoring a growing trend of traditional firms embracing the decentralized future. The strategic accumulation of SharpLink Gaming ETH continues to capture attention, signaling confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. SharpLink Gaming ETH: A Deep Dive into Their Latest Acquisition The details of this remarkable transaction, brought to light by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, paint a clear picture of SharpLink Gaming’s methodical approach to digital asset accumulation. The firm initiated the process by depositing a substantial $108 million in USDC to Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector. Within two hours of this deposit, SharpLink Gaming received the Ethereum tokens at an average price of $3,550 per ETH. Not content with this initial large-scale purchase, SharpLink Gaming subsequently transferred an additional $55.56 million in USDC, indicating a continuous and aggressive buying strategy. This latest tranche of acquisitions brings SharpLink Gaming’s total accumulated SharpLink Gaming ETH holdings to an impressive 464,000 tokens. This figure positions them as one of the most prominent traditional companies with such a significant stake in Ethereum, making their movements closely watched by market participants. Here’s a snapshot of the latest transaction: Metric Details ETH Acquired (Latest) 14,933 ETH Value of Latest Acquisition ~$53 Million Average Purchase Price $3,550 per ETH Total SharpLink Gaming ETH Holdings 464,000 ETH Why is SharpLink Gaming ETH Accumulation So Significant? The consistent accumulation of Ethereum by a Nasdaq-listed company like SharpLink Gaming carries substantial weight for several reasons: Institutional Validation: When a publicly traded company allocates significant capital to a cryptocurrency, it sends a powerful signal to the broader financial market. It suggests that digital assets are maturing and gaining acceptance as legitimate investment vehicles, moving beyond speculative interest. Long-Term Confidence: Such large-scale, sustained purchases imply a long-term bullish outlook on Ethereum’s potential. Firms like SharpLink Gaming are likely betting on Ethereum’s role in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3, viewing ETH as a foundational digital commodity. Market Impact: While individual purchases might not dramatically swing the market, consistent institutional buying removes ETH from the circulating supply, potentially contributing to price appreciation over time, especially if other institutions follow suit. Diversification Strategy: For traditional companies, adding digital assets like Ethereum to their balance sheet can be a diversification strategy, hedging against inflation or seeking exposure to a high-growth, innovative asset class. The SharpLink Gaming ETH strategy exemplifies this forward-thinking approach. SharpLink Gaming ETH Strategy: Understanding the Mechanics How does a large corporation go about acquiring tens of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency? It’s not typically done through retail exchanges. Institutional-grade transactions often involve: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: Firms like Galaxy Digital act as OTC desks, facilitating large trades directly between buyers and sellers. This allows for price stability and avoids slippage that might occur on public exchanges when dealing with such massive volumes. Custodial Solutions: Once acquired, these significant holdings require secure storage. Institutional investors typically use qualified custodians who provide robust security measures, insurance, and regulatory compliance, ensuring the safety of the digital assets. On-Chain Transparency: While the direct parties to an OTC trade might be private, the movement of funds on the blockchain is publicly verifiable. This is how analysts like @EmberCN can track these large transactions, providing transparency into institutional flows of SharpLink Gaming ETH and other digital assets. This systematic approach highlights the growing infrastructure supporting institutional participation in the crypto market, making it easier and safer for traditional companies to engage with digital assets. What Are the Implications of SharpLink Gaming ETH Holdings for the Market? The ongoing accumulation by SharpLink Gaming, and similar actions by other entities, carries several implications for the broader cryptocurrency market: Reduced Supply Pressure: Each ETH acquired by an institutional holder like SharpLink Gaming is often moved into cold storage or long-term holding wallets, effectively reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges. This can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Increased Legitimacy: The involvement of Nasdaq-listed companies adds another layer of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space, potentially encouraging more conservative investors and institutions to consider digital assets. Regulatory Scrutiny: As more traditional firms enter the crypto arena, regulatory bodies may increase their focus on digital asset markets, potentially leading to clearer guidelines and frameworks, which can be a double-edged sword – offering clarity but also imposing restrictions. Market Sentiment Boost: News of significant institutional buys often acts as a positive catalyst, boosting market confidence and attracting further investment from both retail and institutional players. The continued accumulation of SharpLink Gaming ETH can contribute to this positive sentiment. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The crypto market remains volatile, and even large institutional holdings are subject to market fluctuations. Regulatory changes could impact the value or usability of these assets, and security risks, though mitigated by custodians, always exist in the digital realm. Navigating the Future: SharpLink Gaming ETH and Institutional Trends SharpLink Gaming’s consistent and substantial investment in Ethereum is not an isolated event but rather a microcosm of a larger trend: the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. From Bitcoin ETFs to corporate balance sheet allocations, traditional finance is slowly but surely integrating digital assets into its portfolios and strategies. This trend suggests a future where digital assets are no longer niche investments but integral components of diversified financial strategies. For Ethereum specifically, institutional interest reinforces its position as a critical blockchain infrastructure, valued for its smart contract capabilities, vibrant ecosystem, and potential for innovation. As we look ahead, the actions of companies like SharpLink Gaming will serve as benchmarks for others considering similar ventures. Their strategic moves with SharpLink Gaming ETH not only validate the asset but also provide a real-world example of how traditional firms can navigate and benefit from the evolving digital economy. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption SharpLink Gaming’s latest $53 million acquisition of Ethereum is more than just another large transaction; it’s a powerful testament to the growing confidence of Nasdaq-listed firms in the long-term value and utility of digital assets. Their methodical accumulation of 464,000 ETH underscores a strategic vision that sees Ethereum as a core component of future financial landscapes. This move reinforces the narrative of institutional embrace, potentially paving the way for further mainstream adoption and shaping the trajectory of the cryptocurrency market. As the lines between traditional finance and the digital economy continue to blur, SharpLink Gaming stands out as a pioneering example of strategic institutional investment in the crypto frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is SharpLink Gaming, and why are they buying Ethereum? A1: SharpLink Gaming is a Nasdaq-listed firm primarily known for its gaming-related services. They are acquiring Ethereum as part of a strategic investment and asset accumulation strategy, signaling their belief in the long-term value and utility of digital assets like ETH, and potentially as a diversification method for their corporate treasury. Q2: How much Ethereum has SharpLink Gaming accumulated in total? A2: According to on-chain analysis, SharpLink Gaming has accumulated a total of 464,000 ETH to date, making them a significant institutional holder of Ethereum. Q3: How do large firms like SharpLink Gaming acquire such vast amounts of ETH? A3: Large firms typically acquire significant amounts of cryptocurrency through Over-the-Counter (OTC) desks, like Galaxy Digital, rather than public exchanges. OTC desks facilitate direct, large-volume trades, minimizing price impact and ensuring privacy and efficiency for institutional transactions. Q4: What is the significance of a Nasdaq-listed firm buying so much ETH? A4: The significance lies in the institutional validation it provides for cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates that traditional, publicly traded companies view digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles, which can boost market confidence, attract more institutional capital, and contribute to the mainstream adoption of crypto. Q5: Does SharpLink Gaming’s ETH accumulation affect the market price of Ethereum? A5: While individual large purchases might not cause immediate drastic price swings, consistent institutional accumulation, such as that by SharpLink Gaming, can reduce the liquid supply of ETH on exchanges. This can contribute to upward price pressure over the long term, especially as demand for Ethereum continues to grow. Q6: How does on-chain analysis reveal these large transactions? A6: Blockchain technology is transparent. While the identities of wallet owners might be pseudonymous, the transactions themselves (the amount, sender, and receiver addresses) are publicly recorded. On-chain analysts monitor these large movements to identify significant institutional activity, like the accumulation of SharpLink Gaming ETH .

Information from blockchain analytics provider Dune reveals increased activity on the network with a focus on Brazilian real (BRL)-pegged stablecoins. The appreciation is a product of mass adoption, more key players joining the market, and stiff competition in tokens on XRPL. In July, stablecoins’ transactions spiked on the XRP Ledger, specifically for tokens such as BrazaBank-issued BBRL. Last month alone, Dune Analytics reports over $4.2 million worth of BBRL was minted. “This impressive growth makes BBRL the second largest BRL stablecoin in circulation, over only the BRZ token issued by Transfero Group,” read a press release. To paint a picture, in Dune’s visual, we can see how BBRL’s minting figures increased to pandemic levels at one point. As the largest market cap by far, BRZ has increased more slowly lately. It took its strongest spike earlier this year, but then it plateaued. This increase in the new minting of BBRL indicates an increasing need to use the XRP Ledger as an issuer and settlement infrastructure for stablecoin exchanges. It also indicates an increasing need for stablecoin products as a cross-link between fiat currency and blockchain, notably in Latin America, due to currency volatility prompting users to turn to digital substitutes. Users drive surge in RLUSD transfers across the network The Brazilian real-pegged stablecoins are making more news in Brazil, though the US dollar one is also gaining traction quite fast on the XRP Ledger. Tron’s USDT-based stablecoin, RLUSD token , skyrocketed daily transactions from ~5,000 a few months ago to 12K last month. An increase in this transaction type indicates increasing confidence that XRPL can handle stablecoin transactions at scale. The rise of RLUSD also tells a larger story: the XRP Ledger is not only powering up regional stablecoin frenzy but also entering into another phase in which the network becomes an infrastructure layer for fiat-backed cryptocurrencies globally. BRL tokens challenge XRP ledger’s dominance New use cases for digital assets have emerged over the last couple of years beyond just being a means to transfer value. It’s typical in a crowded field to have one or two stocks challenge for the title, and BBRL is there after July, during which it was very strong, coincident with increasing institutional support. The active role played by BrazaBank in randomly minting BBRL and being a participant of the XRPL ecosystem makes the token unique. If this tempo maintains, BBRL could soon threaten BRZ for market supremacy. The institutional aspect is an important momentum behind this. As additional banks and fintech entities targeted stablecoins for payments , remittances, or asset tokenization, the XRP Ledger is a reliable, low-cost settlement backbone. The excitement over XRP Ledger stablecoins suggests a larger trend of how value will move across borders. As uncertainty about fiat values and inflation rates rises in some countries worldwide, it’s a time when stablecoins could offer a more predictable vehicle for saving or spending. “The rise in BRL and USD-pegged stablecoins is just an early development step,” say industry watchers. More tokens will be released on the XRPL, while pilot projects for euro- and peso-backed assets have started in various regions.

The contrast was sharp; American production is breaking records while Saudi rigs keep falling, giving traders no clear direction on where oil prices are heading. According to reporting from the companies’ earnings and market data from CNBC, Exxon’s oil and gas production last quarter was the highest it has seen for any second quarter since Exxon and Mobil merged over two decades ago. Darren Woods, the chief executive of Exxon, said the results “proved the value of our strategy and competitive advantages,” despite lower oil prices and global uncertainty. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to raise global tariffs only worsened the drop in demand expectations, with Brent crude falling 11% during the quarter after OPEC+ producers turned on the taps and increased supply. Chevron closes Hess deal, reopens Venezuela exports after license return Chevron didn’t miss either. The company’s second-quarter profits also came in higher than what analysts expected, helped by record-level oil and gas output and a tight rein on capital spending. Chevron had just shut down a legal roadblock from Exxon to complete its $55 billion purchase of Hess, giving it a stake in the Stabroek Block, a major offshore field in Guyana operated by Exxon. The company is counting on that field to keep profits flowing well into the 2030s, even if crude prices stay unpredictable. Chevron is also resuming crude exports from Venezuela this month. That follows a license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department allowing Chevron to carry out swap deals with Venezuela, which is still under U.S. sanctions. Chief Executive Mike Wirth said during the earnings call that the first shipments would be “a limited amount,” and he doesn’t expect them to have much of an impact on the company’s third-quarter financials. Those exports had been frozen since April when PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, canceled scheduled cargoes due to unpaid invoices. Back in March, Trump’s White House revoked the Chevron license that had originally been granted under former President Joe Biden, forcing the company to wind down activities by May. But a prisoner exchange between Washington and Caracas last month helped turn things around. Congress also pushed for Chevron to regain access to Venezuelan barrels, aiming to keep those supplies from going to China. Saudi rig count dives as focus turns to natural gas While American firms are scaling up, Saudi Arabia has been doing the opposite. Its oil rig count sank to 20 in July, down from 46 in early 2024, the lowest since February 2005. That’s six straight months of cuts, after Riyadh decided to walk away from plans to increase Aramco’s output capacity to 13 million barrels per day. They’re sticking to 12 million instead. That drop matters because Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter, and rig counts give clues about future supply. But while drilling for oil is down, drilling for natural gas is way up. The country wants to save 1 million barrels of crude per day by 2030 by switching over to gas in its own power plants. Aramco’s chief executive Amin Nasser said in May that more than half of the company’s upstream investment this year has gone to gas projects. Saudi Arabia had earlier planned to sell that gas abroad in the form of blue ammonia, but now it’s reconsidering. A Bloomberg report claims that officials are looking at different options to export gas more efficiently. Still, even with gas rigs climbing, the country’s unconventional gas programs haven’t fully made up for the dip in oil activity. And that’s hitting service companies hard. Aramco signed 23 gas rig contracts worth $2.4 billion back in June. Another group of deals that was originally expected earlier this year has now been pushed back to the fourth quarter. That delay is making life even tougher for rig suppliers already dealing with lower demand, especially with more oil fields moving into rigless operations as they mature. Get seen where it counts.

The DeFi token is priced at $0.035 during the 6th stage of its presale. The 7th stage will see a 14.29% price appreciation to $0.04. Existing investors anticipate a 71.43% return when the token goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $13.8 million worth of funding and attracted over 14,700 investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Falters Near $0.000014 Amid Cooling Momentum Shiba Inu is currently trading around $0.0000146, after sliding from mid‑July highs near $0.0000159 and settling into a tighter range marked by resistance just above $0.0000140 and support around $0.0000123. Technical signals point to weakening momentum, trading volume and burn-driven gains have slowed, and SHIB has dropped back below its 200-day simple moving average even though it remains above the Ichimoku cloud, suggesting long-term trend support may still persist. Analysts note that unless SHIB decisively breaks above the $0.000019 zone, the path to substantial gains could be limited, and consolidation between $0.000012–$0.000014 may continue in the near term. Amid this cooling meme coin environment, growing attention is shifting toward emerging DeFi narratives such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Launches Phase 6 with Strong Momentum Mutuum Finance has closed Phase 5 of presale and entered Phase 6, where the tokens are priced at $0.035, a 16.17% jump from the previous round. The subsequent price increase will take the value to $0.04, an increase of another 14.29%. Investors who invest at this point will earn 71.43% returns when MUTM hits its launch value of $0.06. So far, presale has drawn over 14,700 unique holders and raised over $13.8 million, reflecting strong and growing interest in the initiative.

According to the CoinGecko Altcoin Season Index, roughly 40% of lower‑cap coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days—suggesting a renewed phase of speculative rotation . In particular, projects combining rapid community interest, technical updates, and limited early access are gaining traction. Investors are recalibrating, looking beyond large-cap stability and aiming for breakout setups . The question now becomes: how do you prepare—and which tokens are set to lead? With anticipation building for the next altcoin season, crypto communities are actively preparing capital and scanning for early opportunities . Retail traders and private groups alike are watching social metrics, trends, and utility-based narratives – looking for the next breakout project before it goes mainstream. Many believe the setup is aligning: market sentiment is turning, activity is rising, and viral momentum is starting to return to select altcoins. Amid this preparation, some investors have already flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the early-phase tokens worth watching closely. MAGACOIN FINANCE highlighted for audit-backed security amid rising demand As the market gears up for the next altcoin wave, thousands of investors are actively researching how to prepare—looking for early-stage tokens that combine strong momentum with limited access .

Operating on exclusive access open now , and limited-time early access , MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing capital from investors seeking upside with structural credibility – and many consider it the ideal entry point in this wave. Preparing for the altcoin pivot: What to watch for To capitalize on the next altcoin surge, consider these strategic factors: Narrative Strength : Projects tied to timely, relatable narratives often gain momentum faster than purely technical innovations. Early Access Windows : Projects with time – limited entry opportunities often outperform once broader access opens.

The report, released Friday, showed hiring in sharp decline, and instead of backing the claim that the data was faked, both officials focused on painting the numbers in a better light. Vance shared a post on X, using a graphic that showed a rise in native-born workers and a fall in jobs held by foreign-born workers. He implied the change reflected Trump’s immigration policies. Chavez-DeRemer, speaking earlier that day on Bloomberg TV, said even though the data was revised downward, “job growth is still on the right path.” She said the administration had added “nearly half a million jobs” since Trump returned to the White House, including gains in construction and health care. Absolutely no data backs that claim, of course. Chavez-DeRemer defended numbers before Trump fires BLS chief The BLS report showed payrolls increased by only 73,000 in July, and previous months were revised down by nearly 260,000, bringing the three-month average to 35,000, the lowest since the pandemic era. Chavez-DeRemer said the unexpected revisions were mostly in education and seasonal work, noting, “62% of those were in education and seasonal workforce. So, we sometimes see the numbers catch up to what’s on the ground.” She also highlighted Trump’s economic steps in early July, pointing to his passage of a tax and spending bill and his use of tariffs to negotiate new trade deals. While Chavez-DeRemer worked to steady the narrative, Trump moved in another direction. On X, the labor secretary named William Wiatrowski, the deputy, as the new acting commissioner. “I agree wholeheartedly with POTUS that our jobs numbers must be fair, accurate, and never manipulated for political purposes,” Chavez-DeRemer posted right after Trump fired the BLS chief, repeating the repeating unproven claims. Trump lashes out at BLS and Powell as backlash grows The BLS, which reports to Chavez-DeRemer’s department, reportedly confirmed the firing through a statement to CNBC: “BLS can confirm Commissioner Erika McEntarfer was terminated today. Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as Acting Commissioner for BLS.” Trump has long criticized the bureau’s data handling, especially around large revisions. Last year, the BLS adjusted its 12-month payroll total down by 818,000 jobs for the period ending in March 2024. That gave the White House another reason to question the agency’s reliability. In his most recent spending proposal, Trump pushed for an 8% staff cut at the BLS, raising new concerns over its ability to handle labor, price, and economic figures without relying on estimated inputs. Before the Friday report dropped, Trump was still celebrating the previous month’s jobs data. After the June figures were released, the White House called it a “June Boom.” But that tone changed after Friday’s numbers came in, and the markets quickly reacted. The Dow Jones fell by over 500 points, the Nasdaq dropped more than 2%, and Treasury yields took a hit. William Beach, who led the BLS before McEntarfer and was appointed by Trump in 2017, said the move was unjustified. “The totally groundless firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, my successor as Commissioner of Labor Statistics at BLS, sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau,” Beach wrote on X. In a longer statement, he added, “This escalates the President’s unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system. The President seeks to blame someone for unwelcome economic news.” Meanwhile, for the third time in the past 24 hours, Trump also attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing his refusal to lower interest rates. Powell has said the Fed won’t make a move until it sees how Trump’s tariffs affect inflation.

Research Firm Says Momentum Just Flipped Bearish,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-fakeout-research-firm-momentum-bearish/,"Bitcoin’s latest push towards $120,000 fizzled into a stall-out that now resembles a “failed breakout zone,” according to market analytics firm Swissblock. In a July 31 thread, the firm said “momentum has failed to ignite,” arguing that realized-profit flows and an overwhelming share of coins sitting in profit have turned every bounce into an opportunity for supply to meet price. Profit-Taking Cools Bitcoin Rally Swissblock framed the setback as a pause rather than a breakdown. “Profit-taking is rising—but not as intense as late 2024,” the firm wrote, adding that the effect through July was “enough to cap upside and trigger consolidation.” The tone is cooling, not capitulatory: “Selling pressure is visible, but not extreme—think cooling, not capitulation.” That diagnosis hinges on on-chain readings of realized profit—an input that tends to expand into rallies as long-held coins are spent into strength—and a market structure in which bids are absorbing supply rather than being overwhelmed by it. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet The most striking datapoint in the thread is breadth of profitability: “96% of supply is in profit,” Swissblock noted, citing Glassnode. That ratio is historically consistent with late-cycle euphoria, but it is also mechanically self-limiting; when nearly all holders are in the green, latent sell pressure rises because “unrealized gains are tempting sellers.” As Swissblock put it, “Strong holders remain. But unrealized gains are tempting sellers. Until demand returns, each bounce invites supply.” The firm contends the broader trend “is intact—but momentum needs a reset.” Beyond on-chain realized flows, the firm’s composite fundamentals read neutral with improving liquidity. “BTC fundamentals are strong and stable,” Swissblock wrote, pointing to a Bitcoin Fundamentals Index reading of 60 (neutral), “Network Growth is cooling,” and “Liquidity is recovering.” That mix typically favors range behavior over directional surges—“a consolidation-supportive environment,” as the post put it—in which Bitcoin “can grind sideways longer—until it’s ready to break with conviction.” The implication is that the market’s “failed breakout” risk reflects timing rather than trend reversal: positioning and liquidity are not aligned yet for a sustained continuation. Related Reading: Weak Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Be Crushed By Bear Market, Insider Warns The cross-asset context is equally nuanced. “Altseason is active—but under stress,” Swissblock wrote, observing that while “$ETH continues to outperform BTC structurally, holding up better in this pullback,” most altcoins are sagging, with “only 5% of top 100 showing positive impulse.” That thinning rotation underlines the selectivity of risk appetite and the fragility of momentum outside of the largest names. Historically, that pattern often precedes a decisive move in Bitcoin that either recharges the rotation or breaks it. Swissblock’s concluding assessment leans cautiously constructive. “Profit-taking is fading and selling pressure is being absorbed. BTC is preparing for breakout—but momentum needs to align.” Until that alignment arrives, the firm expects a grind: bids continue to meet supply from profitable holders, realized profits moderate, and liquidity improves in the background. If and when Bitcoin flips momentum back to positive, Swissblock argues, the spillover could be forceful: “While BTC grinds sideways, watch for the moment it flips—ETH and altcoins will likely explode upward when it does.” In short, today’s dip to $115,000 looks less like an outright rejection than a test of the market’s ability to digest profits and reset momentum without damage to the underlying uptrend. With 96% of supply in profit and breadth compressed, the next impulse likely hinges on whether liquidity and demand can reassert themselves before profit-taking reaccelerates. For now, Swissblock’s message is clear: the breakout will need to be earned, not assumed. At press time, BTC traded at $115,452.

With fresh capital waiting on the sidelines and social channels flooded with speculation, the hunt for under-the-radar tokens with high growth potential is in full swing. Analysts, influencers, and early adopters are comparing notes on which assets could deliver the next big returns – driven by narrative strength, engaged communities, and strategic access phases. In this rapidly shifting landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE is beginning to stand out , gaining momentum for its expanding utility roadmap, rising demand, and limited-time early access window that many see as a key entry point. MAGACOIN FINANCE tipped for 35× growth amid strategic market surge Analysts now identify MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout value play, forecasting a 35X growth trajectory based on emerging ecosystem demand. The project has delivered record-breaking community sign‑ups and strong sellout rounds, while expanding utility for token holders within its growing ecosystem. What sets it apart is its focused early‑access window – exclusive access open now and available for a limited time only – creating a rare entry point as broader awareness builds. As markets rotate toward narrative‑rich, under‑the‑radar assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being highlighted as a prime candidate for asymmetrical upside—without compromising on structure or long‑term roadmap clarity. BlackHole surges as Avalanche’s emerging DEX draws real liquidity Meanwhile, BlackHole—a DeFi protocol on Avalanche—is rapidly climbing in relevance, earning recognition for reaching over $250 million in TVL and becoming the platform’s largest DEX within weeks. Analysts note its innovative cross‑chain liquidity tools and fee-generation model as key differentiators positioning it for institutional attention, particularly as Avalanche adoption deepens in 2025. Conclusion: Prepare now to benefit from altcoin season Altcoin season feels imminent, and those who position early may capture real asymmetrical gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE, backed by its projected 35X upside , growing engagement, and strategic early‑access structure, is standing out as a leading candidate among emerging assets. When viewed alongside evolving stories like PENGU’s brand influence and BlackHole’s DeFi traction, the project profile aligns with the types of narratives poised to win in the next market cycle.

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price outlook shows the token hovering near $0.0000135, and analysts are targeting a run to $0.000015. The Tron (TRX) price chart looks equally solid, with TRX holding above $0.31 and aiming for $0.33. But while these assets ride price waves, Cold Wallet is flipping the strategy. Now live at just $0.00942, the Cold Wallet ($CWT) presale is giving users instant CWT rewards for every swap, gas fee, or on/off-ramp transaction, no staking, no waiting. With price tiers moving fast toward $0.015, $0.05, and higher, early participants are locking in rewards before entry costs jump. And for those targeting bullish crypto coins in 2025, Cold Wallet is not just a token; it’s a tool that pays you for what you already do. Cold Wallet Turns Crypto Use Into an Income-Generating Habit Crypto used to be about holding and hoping. Cold Wallet changes that by rewarding every action. Whether you’re bridging, swapping, or moving funds, CWT rewards kick in instantly. There’s no staking required and no lockups. Just use the wallet and get paid, simple as that. Its tier system puts earning power in your hands. The more CWT you hold, the bigger your cashback. Diamond tier users can earn up to 100% of gas fees and 50% of swap fees back in CWT. That’s why early adopters are stacking now, because once the price moves past $0.00942, each new tier raises the cost of access. With the launch price set $0.3517, users who buy now will get over 3630% ROI at launch. This approach is catching the attention of buyers tracking bullish crypto coins in 2025. Unlike loyalty programs that lose value over time, Cold Wallet’s reward model grows with adoption. CWT isn’t just a token to hold; it’s an asset that pays you every day, based on the crypto activity you already perform. The presale includes 150 price stages and is currently at $0.00942, with 40% of the 10 billion token supply allocated for sale. There’s also a referral program, 10% for the referrer, 5% for the referee. Vesting is straightforward: 10% unlocks at TGE, and the rest over three months. With this much momentum building, CWT is quickly becoming one of the most-watched bullish crypto coins in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Outlook Eyes a Break Above Key Resistance The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price outlook shows the token stabilising around $0.0000135 after erasing much of its July surge. Analysts are watching the $0.0000136 support line closely. Holding this level could pave the way to $0.0000145–$0.000015 soon. Forecasts from CoinCodex go further, pointing to $0.000021 by early August if buy volume returns. For the mid-term, SHIB projections stay positive. August targets range between $0.0000148 and $0.0000161, and if momentum holds through 2025, the chart opens a path toward $0.000062–$0.000094. Shibarium’s adoption and consistent token burns are driving this outlook, shrinking supply while adding new functionality. If these trends continue, SHIB could break out, making it a must-watch for those betting on meme coin strength. Tron (TRX) Price Chart Holds Steady as Traders Look for a Push to $0.33 The Tron (TRX) price chart shows strength with TRX trading at $0.314, just below its recent $0.334 peak. Key support levels are holding at $0.308–$0.310, while resistance lies near $0.318–$0.33. Analysts suggest a break above $0.33 could lead to gains of around $0.35–$0.36. Short-term models forecast a move to $0.325–$0.33 in early August. TRX’s technicals remain healthy, with both 50- and 200-day moving averages trending upward. Longer-term expectations are even more ambitious. Some forecasts suggest TRX could hit $0.40 by the end of 2025, with bullish outlooks extending toward $0.514 if adoption and network activity increase. Tron has already generated $364 million in transaction fees in just the past 30 days, with over 2.4 million daily active users. This consistent activity, combined with a rise in stablecoin use, gives TRX real potential to grow into one of the standout bullish crypto coins in 2025. Wrapping Up The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price outlook shows the token coiling for a possible breakout toward $0.000015, with analysts even eyeing $0.000021 if August turns bullish. Meanwhile, the Tron (TRX) price chart remains solid above $0.31, with short-term projections pointing to $0.33 and long-term targets up to $0.40 and beyond. But while SHIB and TRX gain on price speculation, Cold Wallet is rewarding users from day one. At just $0.00942, CWT is helping users turn routine crypto actions into continuous income. There’s no waiting, no staking, just cashback for swaps, gas, and ramps. It’s not just a utility; it’s becoming one of the most useful and bullish crypto coins in 2025 . Early buyers are locking in lifetime rewards before the price pushes to $0.015, $0.05, or $0.10. Cold Wallet isn’t following the hype. It’s creating a new standard for how crypto should reward its users, immediately, automatically, and with long-term value baked in.

But sometimes, a few projects rise above the noise. Lately, BlockDAG, SEI, Ethena, and SUI are making waves, whether due to large-scale adoption, network activity, or strategic growth. These coins are drawing attention for real reasons, not just temporary hype. Each one brings a unique angle to the table. From BlockDAG’s ready-to-use network to SEI’s growing locked value, Ethena’s buyback drive, and SUI’s powerful trading volume, there’s plenty going on. These developments aren’t small; they’re putting these names among the best cryptos to buy right now. Read on for a closer look at what sets each apart in this month’s spotlight. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Launch-Ready Network with Global Reach BlockDAG stands apart by entering the market already built, not just promised. It includes a complete Layer 1 network, an active mobile mining app called X1, physical mining gear (X-Series), and a growing lineup of dApps and developers. This setup puts it ahead of many projects still in early development. Everything is functional from day one, giving both builders and users something they can immediately access. Activity is already spiking. Over 2.5 million users are mining daily through the app, and nearly 18,880 mining devices have been purchased. These aren’t just passive numbers; there’s real usage and value being generated across the ecosystem. The funding story supports this momentum. So far, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $358M and sold over 24.6 billion coins. Its price has increased by 2,660% since Batch 1, and it now sits at $0.0276. However, through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the price is temporarily set at $0.0016 until August 11. This limited-time price could deliver a 3,025% return based on its $0.05 listing rate. Compared to other names in the space, BlockDAG offers something fully operational even before launch. This makes it one of the best cryptos to buy for those looking at functionality and value before exchange listings. 2. SEI (SEI): Sharp TVL Rise Brings This Chain Into Focus SEI is becoming a serious contender due to its rapid increase in on-chain metrics. It’s backed by Circle and has grown its Total Value Locked (TVL) from $28M to over $600M in just months. This shows strong adoption and network strength. The platform is also processing a high number of transactions, even surpassing well-established chains like Arbitrum and Ethereum in activity. Currently, SEI trades between $0.31 and $0.33. The resistance level of $0.35 is being watched closely. If this level breaks, some forecasts see a rise toward $1 this year. Longer-term, there’s potential to see $3 or more by 2030, depending on how adoption continues. This steady growth and activity put SEI among the best cryptos to buy for anyone tracking on-chain success and scaling potential. 3. Ethena (ENA): Buyback Strategy Brings Price Push Ethena is gaining serious attention through its structured buyback plan. A $260M effort is underway to repurchase ENA, limiting supply and increasing overall trading interest. This move has sparked momentum, especially as ENA’s performance starts to outpace competitors like Circle and PancakeSwap in earnings. The coin is currently trading around $0.60, after breaking through a resistance zone. Momentum could continue, possibly taking it to $0.85 or $1.00. However, technical signals show overbought conditions, which may lead to some pullback or sideways action in the short term. If volume remains high, this chart setup still holds promise. Ethena’s strategic planning and market reactions make it one of the best cryptos to buy for those paying attention to strong DeFi movements. 4. SUI (SUI): Heavy Volume And Unlock Event In Play SUI has been drawing strong interest due to its large daily trading volume and stablecoin usage. In recent days, SUI trading topped $2B, and its stablecoin activity even surpassed Solana’s, signaling growing real-world usage and a strong ecosystem foundation. However, SUI is also facing a coin unlock valued around $240M. This could bring short-term selling pressure. At the moment, prices hover between $3.70 and $3.80. If a bearish trend takes over, a drop toward $3.49 could follow. But if the price breaks $4.00, there may be room to climb to $4.50 or even $8.00 over time. Long-range forecasts range between $4 and $6 by late 2025, with some pushing toward $10 by 2030. For those watching volume-based traction, SUI stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy with future potential. Final Take BlockDAG brings fully working systems to the table, SEI is making serious progress in locked value and transactions, Ethena is using buybacks to tighten supply, and SUI is moving serious volume while handling coin unlocks. Each of these projects brings something real, not just talk. They are being built, used, and followed closely by many in space. Among all the names competing for attention, these four are starting to show real staying power. While no outcome is guaranteed, the data and activity speak volumes. For those scanning the landscape, these may be the best cryptos to buy right now based on performance, structure, and use case strength.

The GENIUS Act, signed into law just two weeks ago, made clear that Washington is fully backing stablecoins that hold a 1:1 peg with the dollar. Asian governments are watching closely as their own citizens pour billions into dollar-pegged stablecoins. Big players like JD.com and Ant Group are now applying to issue stablecoins of their own. Shares of Kakaopay jumped on speculation it might enter the space too. Korean regulators fight over who controls stablecoin issuance In South Korea, the tension is no longer quiet. President Lee Jae Myung’s ruling party proposed the Digital Asset Basic Act on June 10 to open a legal path for local firms to issue won-backed stablecoins. That proposal immediately set off alarms at the Bank of Korea. Ryoo Sangdai, the bank’s senior deputy governor, warned that stablecoins could interfere with capital policies and slow down the push to internationalize the won. Two weeks later, Governor Rhee Chang Yong went even further, saying that non-bank stablecoins would bring back the same instability seen when private firms issued their own money in the 1800s. John Park, head of Korea at the Arbitrum Foundation, said the concern isn’t just local. Stablecoins made in Asia could easily connect to global markets using decentralized platforms. “Local stablecoins, while offering regulatory visibility at the point of issuance, carry the risk of becoming efficient bridges to global markets through seamless crypto-to-crypto swaps on decentralized exchanges,” Park told Bloomberg. Instead of blocking this, Park said Asia’s central banks should guide it. Build the rules, don’t fight the tide. The numbers show why this matters. Right now, dollar-backed stablecoins make up $256 billion of the global market. Compare that with just $403 million worth of euro-pegged stablecoins. And that’s with Europe having a full rulebook already. So it’s not surprising that South Koreans traded over $41 billion worth of USDT, USDC, and USDS in just the first quarter of this year, based on Bank of Korea data. Hong Kong pushes forward while China watches from the side Hong Kong is going full speed. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority wants stablecoins to show real-world value, not just theoretical guardrails. Clara Chiu, founder of QReg Advisory, said that many of the firms applying to create yuan-backed stablecoins are already using the yuan in global payments. The city is becoming the testing ground for what could be a much bigger play: crypto instruments tied directly to the Chinese currency. China still has a public ban on crypto trading. But behind the curtain, there’s movement. In June, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng said stablecoins could have a place in global finance, especially at a time when cross-border payments are feeling the pressure of rising political tensions. That single comment has already shifted the mood. A large, state-owned Chinese brokerage just got a license in Hong Kong to work with crypto. Chiu said it gave the industry “hope that there’s a way.” But don’t expect Beijing to jump in with open arms. Lily King, the chief operating officer at crypto custodian Cobo, said Hong Kong will stay the sandbox. Chinese firms will use it to experiment, but the mainland will keep its doors shut. “China may not feel the need to open itself,” King said. Crypto traders want more choices though. Yoann Turpin, co-founder of market maker Wintermute, said, “Capital controls are a challenge. But stablecoins could provide a vetted, more efficient on-chain system.” The user base is already there. In South Korea, around 18 million people, over one-third of the entire population, are already involved in crypto. Sam Seo, chairman of the Kaia DLT Foundation, said a stablecoin backed by the won would serve different needs than US dollar ones. “In the short term, swaps between the won and USDT will dominate. But longer term, we’ll need stablecoins from other countries to support direct pairings and faster settlement,” Seo said.

When a figure of his stature makes a significant move, the market takes notice. Recently, the digital asset community was abuzz with news of a substantial Arthur Hayes crypto sale , involving millions of dollars in various digital assets. This event naturally raises questions about market sentiment, whale behavior, and what it could mean for the broader crypto landscape. Understanding the Arthur Hayes Crypto Sale: What Happened? In a move that caught the attention of many market observers, Arthur Hayes executed a substantial Arthur Hayes crypto sale over a period of just six hours. The details, first highlighted by on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, reveal a multi-asset offload that underscores the dynamic nature of large-scale crypto holdings. This wasn’t just a minor adjustment; it was a significant divestment across several prominent digital currencies. Specifically, the sale encompassed three distinct cryptocurrencies, each with its own market position and investor base. The sheer volume and value of these transactions are what make this particular Arthur Hayes crypto sale noteworthy. Here is a breakdown of the assets involved in this recent offload: Asset Quantity Offloaded Approximate USD Value Ethereum (ETH) 2,373 ETH $8,320,000 Ethena (ENA) 7,760,000 ENA $4,620,000 Pepe (PEPE) 38,860,000,000 PEPE $414,700 Total Value ~$13,354,700 The significant crypto offload by Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, totaling over $13 million across ETH, ENA, and PEPE. Arthur Hayes Crypto Sale: Urgent Insights from a $13 Million Offload This substantial offload, totaling over $13.35 million, represents a notable shift in Hayes’s portfolio, at least concerning these specific assets. Such large-scale transactions by prominent figures are often interpreted by the market as potential signals, leading to speculation and analysis. Why Did Arthur Hayes Make This Arthur Hayes Crypto Sale? Exploring Potential Motivations When a major player like Arthur Hayes executes a significant Arthur Hayes crypto sale , the immediate question that arises is: why? While the exact motivations are rarely disclosed publicly, market observers often consider several common reasons for such large-scale divestments: Profit-Taking: It is possible that Hayes decided to realize profits from these assets, especially if they had seen significant appreciation since his acquisition. This is a common strategy for investors to lock in gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large investors frequently rebalance their portfolios to adjust their exposure to different assets. This could involve reducing holdings in certain cryptocurrencies to increase positions in others, or to diversify into traditional assets. Liquidity Needs: While less common for figures of his wealth, there could be personal or business reasons requiring a large amount of liquid capital. Bearish Outlook: A significant sale could signal a bearish short-term or medium-term outlook on the specific assets sold, or the broader crypto market. However, it is crucial to remember that one person’s market view does not define the entire market. Strategic Shifts: Hayes is known for his nuanced and often contrarian views on the market. This sale could be part of a larger, long-term strategic play that aligns with his evolving market predictions or investment theses. Without direct commentary from Hayes, these remain educated guesses. However, understanding these potential motivations helps in interpreting the implications of such a substantial Arthur Hayes crypto sale . The Ripple Effect: How Does a Major Arthur Hayes Crypto Sale Impact the Market? The actions of crypto whales, individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, can indeed send ripples through the market. An Arthur Hayes crypto sale of this magnitude can influence market dynamics in several ways: Price Volatility: A large sell order can increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a temporary price dip for the affected assets. This is especially true for less liquid assets or during periods of low trading volume. Investor Sentiment: News of a prominent figure selling can sometimes trigger a fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) response among smaller investors, leading to panic selling or a cautious approach. Conversely, it can also be seen as a necessary market correction. On-Chain Analysis: Whale movements are closely tracked by analysts and traders using on-chain data. Such sales provide valuable data points for those trying to gauge market sentiment and potential future movements. Liquidity Testing: Large sales test the market’s liquidity, demonstrating its ability to absorb significant orders without crashing. In this case, the market largely absorbed the Arthur Hayes crypto sale without extreme disruption, which can be seen as a sign of underlying strength. It is important to remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by many factors beyond individual whale movements. While significant, a single Arthur Hayes crypto sale is one piece of a much larger puzzle. Navigating Market Volatility After a Significant Arthur Hayes Crypto Sale: Actionable Insights For individual investors, news of a major Arthur Hayes crypto sale can be a source of concern or confusion. However, it is crucial to approach such information with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not blindly follow the actions of whales. Research the fundamentals of the assets you hold. Understand their technology, use cases, and development roadmap. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading your investments across various assets reduces risk. Relying too heavily on one asset, or reacting impulsively to single events, can be detrimental. Understand Market Cycles: Crypto markets are cyclical. Price fluctuations, including dips, are a normal part of the journey. A long-term perspective often helps weather short-term volatility. Manage Emotions: Fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can lead to poor decisions. Stick to your investment plan and avoid impulsive reactions to news. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, regularly investing a fixed amount can help mitigate the impact of price volatility over time. While the Arthur Hayes crypto sale provides an interesting data point, it is just one data point. Successful investing in the crypto space often hinges on informed decisions, risk management, and emotional discipline rather than reactive trading based on individual whale movements. Summary: What the Arthur Hayes Crypto Sale Means for You The recent Arthur Hayes crypto sale , totaling over $13 million in ETH, ENA, and PEPE, underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the significant influence of its key players. While the exact motivations behind such a large offload remain speculative, common reasons often include profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or a strategic shift in market outlook. Such whale movements can certainly create short-term ripples in price and sentiment, but they are only one factor among many that shape the broader market. For individual investors, the takeaway is not to panic, but rather to use such events as a reminder to practice sound investment principles: conduct thorough research, diversify your holdings, manage your emotions, and maintain a long-term perspective. The crypto journey is filled with ups and downs, and understanding the nuances of large-scale transactions helps in navigating these waters more effectively.

The biggest gains rarely come from chasing what’s already trending—they come from spotting momentum as it builds . That means acting during those key windows when community growth, engagement metrics, and limited access overlap. For early-stage tokens, this timing can be everything . Projects that are still small, still underexposed, and showing rapid organic traction offer the most asymmetrical setups. MAGACOIN FINANCE, now entering its final early-access phase with record engagement, is being closely watched as one of those rare, well-timed opportunities . Unprecedented engagement triggers breakout attention In the past 24 hours, MAGACOIN FINANCE recorded a massive spike in community interaction, social mentions, and wallet signups – confirming momentum is building at speed . This wasn’t manufactured hype or influencer noise; it was organic demand from investors responding to the project’s roadmap, scarcity model, and utility expansion. Analysts often consider these real-time signals – especially during early-access stages – as leading indicators of future price movement. As capital floods into emerging narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being flagged as one of the strongest asymmetric setups of the year. With only a limited entry window remaining , investors are treating this moment as a strategic decision point. Each access round has filled faster than the last, and engagement numbers continue to climb. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s appeal lies not just in upside potential – but in its structure: a clear roadmap, expanding utility for holders, and a community-first approach that rewards those who enter early. As attention pivots toward lower-cap tokens with real traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being named by multiple analysts as a top contender for breakout performance in 2025. Exclusive access is open now – but it won’t be for long . How to act while momentum is peaking When a project reaches peak engagement, it’s often a signal that the entry window is tightening. Acting during this phase—when energy, visibility, and access converge—can offer significant upside before mainstream exposure takes hold. Investors looking to get in now are focusing on tokens that combine utility growth, real-time community expansion, and controlled access mechanics. In a market where early positioning matters , waiting too long could mean missing the most asymmetric part of the cycle. Conclusion: This may be the final window before breakout Altcoin momentum is heating up—and for MAGACOIN FINANCE, the signs of breakout potential are already here. With unprecedented daily engagement, surging investor activity, and a fast-closing early-access window, this is the moment many have been waiting for. Analysts see strong structural potential , and momentum is accelerating by the hour. If you’re seeking an early-stage token with serious upside and perfect timing , this may be the final chance to act before MAGACOIN FINANCE goes fully mainstream.

At the time of writing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is trading above $118,000, reflecting a slight pullback of around 3.6% from its most recent all-time high. With the asset still in a tight range, investors are watching whether Bitcoin can establish a breakout or if a price correction is more likely in the near term. Meanwhile, recent on-chain analysis has highlighted an area of potential concern in Bitcoin’s price history that may point to a retest of lower levels before further upward movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Overheating Signals Easing – Is A Second-Half Rally Ahead? Analyst Highlights “Unrealized Gap” in Bitcoin’s Price Movement According to data shared on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, the $111,000–$115,000 range remains an untested zone that could see renewed activity in the future, despite broader market optimism. CryptoQuant contributor and on-chain analyst CryptoMe has identified what he calls a “gap” in Bitcoin’s recent trading behavior. The analyst noted that between July 9 and 14, Bitcoin experienced a rapid rally from $110,000 to $123,000 without significant trading activity in the $111,000–$117,000 range. On-chain data during that period reportedly showed limited retail participation, with most buying pressure coming from institutional players. “This rapid upward move created a visible gap in the UTxO histogram,” CryptoMe explained, adding: Few transactions occurred in that range, meaning unrealized outputs were not established. Historically, such gaps have often been revisited by the market, filling those levels over time. The analyst also mentioned that part of the gap has already been addressed with price action touching $115,000–$117,000 in recent sessions, but the lower section around $111,000 remains unfilled. Historical Patterns Suggest Possible Retest of $111K Drawing from Bitcoin’s 16-year price history, CryptoMe pointed out that similar scenarios have occurred before. For instance, in 2024, Bitcoin skipped the $70,000–$80,000 range on its way to $110,000 but eventually revisited and filled that gap. Related Reading: $141,000 Could Be Next Key Bitcoin Resistance If Price Breaks Higher, Report Says Based on these recurring patterns, the analyst believes the $111,000 level may see a retest, even in a generally bullish environment. “What remains uncertain,” CryptoMe said, “is whether this will happen as a direct drop from current levels or after a further climb, potentially toward $140,000, followed by a correction.” The analyst advises market participants to consider the possibility of a pullback when planning their risk exposure and leverage positions, noting: But either way, I believe the gap will be filled! So investors should know that, even in this bullish environment, a pullback toward 111k is still possible, and they should adjust their positions, leverage, and risk levels accordingly.

Instead of chasing flashy campaigns, it builds loyalty through function and consistency. The platform isn’t trying to dazzle, it’s trying to deliver. This measured approach is what makes Spartans one of the best betting platforms for long-term use. By focusing on what actually matters to consistent bettors: performance, reliability, and user-first design, it sets itself apart from trend-chasing competitors. For serious players, that matters more than any celebrity ad. User-First Design That Speeds Up Every Session While most betting sites lean on animations and branding gimmicks, Spartans focuses on how users engage with their bets. With rapid load times, frictionless navigation, and crisp transitions between slots, sports, and live games, the platform feels more like a precision tool than a flashy app. Returning players don’t have to waste time getting back into the action. Preferences are remembered, sessions reload instantly, and game-switching is smooth. These behind-the-scenes efficiencies are what make Spartans quietly effective—and why so many players keep coming back. Minimalism That Keeps You Focused on the Game One of the most immediate strengths of Spartans is its minimalist layout. No overstuffed banners, no popups interrupting gameplay, and no promotional spam crowding the interface. This approach gives players clarity, not chaos. Game categories are organized, and betslips are snappy and responsive. With no visual clutter, the focus stays where it belongs, on betting strategies and gameplay flow. It’s a clean setup that appeals especially to returning players who just want performance, not distractions. Always Picks Up Where You Left Off Spartans don’t treat each session like a new user visit. Whether you’re watching a live parlay unfold or halfway through a jackpot slot spin, the platform stores your activity in real time. Come back later, and it picks up instantly, no setup needed. From live bet tracking to remembered spins and session history, the system creates a seamless loop that feels natural. In a space where session memory is rare, even among the top crypto casinos, Spartans uses it as a smart retention tool that quietly adds major value. Performance That Doesn’t Flinch Under Pressure Speed matters in crypto betting, and Spartans treat it like a non-negotiable. Deposits confirm within minutes, major crypto withdrawals process in under 15 minutes, and live event streams run without lag. Even during high-traffic events, the platform stays solid. These features might not sound flashy, but they form the foundation of trust. Bettors who have experienced delayed payouts or platform crashes elsewhere often cite Spartans’ consistency as the reason they switched and never looked back. For them, it’s not hype, it’s performance. Real Upgrades, Not Just Empty Headlines Instead of launching loud promo campaigns, Spartans continues improving where it counts. New slot providers, expanded sportsbook coverage, and interface upgrades roll out regularly, with no disruption to the user flow. It’s quiet evolution, not marketing stunts. This behind-the-scenes investment shows a commitment to long-term utility. In a market full of platforms chasing trends, Spartans takes the time to fine-tune its product, and that patience is starting to pay off with growing retention and word-of-mouth traction. Returning Users Get the Experience They Expect First-time users chase bonuses. Regulars chase speed, stability, and accurate odds. Spartans understands that distinction and delivers on all three. Slot performance is glitch-free, live odds auto-update, and tracking tools allow for deeper gameplay analysis over time. The result is a platform that holds up under regular use. Whether users are playing casually or placing bets multiple times a week, Spartans gives them a system they can rely on, one that prioritizes smooth sessions over promotional gimmicks. Final Thoughts Spartans.com doesn’t make headlines with stunts. It earns respect by doing what other sites overlook: building a platform around player needs. Its clean UI, real-time memory, fast transaction processing, and consistent updates make it one of the best betting platforms for performance-driven users. In an industry that often confuses attention with value, Spartans makes the opposite case. It shows that if you build something reliable enough, users will stay for the long haul, not because of what you shout, but because of what you deliver.

Private groups and Discord channels are asking: which token could be the next breakout? Among all of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is pointed for its momentum and time-sensitive early-access window – a narrative gaining traction as demand continues to outpace allocation availability. TROLL token surges amid viral meme campaign and influencer buzz The Solana-based memecoin TROLL skyrocketed to an all-time high of $0.0694 on July 31, driven by viral campaigns on X from influencers like Shadow36 and new listings on Indonesia’s largest exchange, Indodax. Social mentions of TROLL spiked 41% in 24 hours, and trading volume climbed to $18.1 million—confirming its meme-level virality and community buzz. While impressive, over 90% of holders are currently in profit, raising short-term sell-risk. Analysts highlight watching exchange inflows (with KuCoin and Bitrue holding 60% of liquidity) and wallet distribution trends as key signals to watch. MAGACOIN FINANCE early-access nears capacity as engagement soars MAGACOIN FINANCE is approaching full early-access allocation, as demand outpaces supply. This limited-entry structure – exclusive access open now , but for a limited time only—is fueling frenzy as community activity hits new daily records. With unprecedented user sign-ups, wallet growth, and social traction, analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the few early-stage tokens where timing still matters . Its consistent sellout rounds, growing utility roadmap, and small circulating exposure support models projecting significant upside. As awareness builds and access narrows, many view MAGACOIN FINANCE as the standout candidate positioned for breakout moves . Story Token rallies after Grayscale’s institutional trust launch Meanwhile, the Story (IP) surged following the launch of the Grayscale Story Trust, a first-of-its-kind institutional product offering exposure to blockchain-based intellectual property. Volume jumped 88% to $113.7 million, and the token saw an 8–12% price gain as investors digested the institutional momentum. With over 1.7 million monthly on-chain IP transactions, Story Protocol is emerging as a token aligned with AI and licensing narratives. However, IP is nearing overbought RSI levels of ~78.9, signaling potential short-term resistance. Conclusion: Small supply, heated demand, and peak engagement Altcoin narratives are evolving rapidly, and tokens like TROLL and Story have grabbed headlines with explosive viral and institutional momentum. But with high participation and crowded exposures, they may offer less upside ahead . MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its fast-depleting access window and record-breaking daily engagement , remains one of the few early-phase names where capital can still position significantly before broader adoption. Timing and scarcity are critical—and this could be the final entry point for serious upside.

One of the most impactful events that often sends ripples through the trading community is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation . This phenomenon, while complex, is a crucial indicator of market sentiment and the leverage taken by traders. When positions are liquidated, it means that a trader’s leveraged position has been forcibly closed by an exchange due to a loss of initial margin, failing to meet margin requirements. This often happens quickly and can lead to cascading effects across the market. Understanding the dynamics of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation is essential for anyone involved in the digital asset space, from seasoned traders to curious observers. It provides a raw snapshot of where the market is headed and how much risk traders are willing to take. Let us explore the recent 24-hour data to break down these significant events. Understanding Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: What Exactly Happened? Perpetual futures contracts are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, mimicking a spot market but with leverage. This leverage, while amplifying potential gains, also magnifies potential losses. When the market moves against a highly leveraged position, and the margin balance falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically liquidates the position to prevent further losses to the trader and the exchange. The past 24 hours have seen a substantial amount of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation across major assets. Here is a detailed look at the liquidation figures from the last 24 hours: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidation Amount Percentage of Long Liquidations Ethereum (ETH) $267.94 million 88.76% Bitcoin (BTC) $164.38 million 93.99% Solana (SOL) $41.00 million 90.01% As the table illustrates, a substantial amount of capital was wiped out in leveraged positions, predominantly from long positions. This data highlights the significant impact of market movements on traders using high leverage in the perpetual futures market. Why Do Massive Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations Occur? The primary driver behind such large-scale Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation events is often a combination of factors, including sudden price swings, excessive leverage, and cascading effects. When a major cryptocurrency experiences a sharp price decline, especially after a period of upward momentum where many traders have opened long positions with high leverage, liquidations can quickly escalate. Sudden Price Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations. A sudden market downturn, triggered by macro-economic news, regulatory concerns, or large sell orders, can push prices below the liquidation threshold for many leveraged positions. Excessive Leverage: While leverage offers the potential for higher returns, it also carries higher risk. Many traders, especially those new to derivatives, might use leverage that is too high for their capital, leaving them vulnerable to even minor price corrections. Cascading Liquidations: When initial liquidations occur, the forced selling of assets can further drive down prices. This, in turn, triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect that accelerates the market downturn and amplifies the total amount of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation . Market Sentiment and Technical Levels: Breaching key support levels can trigger stop-loss orders and liquidations, reinforcing negative sentiment and leading to further price drops. The Dominance of Long Liquidations: A Closer Look at Market Sentiment A striking aspect of the recent data is the overwhelming percentage of long liquidations. A ‘long’ position profits when the asset’s price increases, while a ‘short’ position profits when the price decreases. The fact that over 88% of the liquidated positions were long indicates a market that was predominantly bullish or optimistic, with traders betting on continued price increases. When the market reversed or corrected, these long positions became unprofitable and were subsequently liquidated. This dominance of long liquidations suggests several things about prevailing market sentiment: Overly Bullish Sentiment: Many traders were likely positioned for an uptrend, perhaps expecting a continuation of previous gains or a bounce from recent lows. Underestimation of Downside Risk: The high leverage used on long positions implies that traders may have underestimated the potential for a significant price correction or lacked robust risk management strategies. Market Correction Signal: Large long liquidations often accompany significant price corrections or downtrends, as the forced selling adds downward pressure. It can serve as a cleansing event, resetting market expectations. The high percentage of long Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation across ETH, BTC, and SOL points to a broad market correction rather than an isolated event affecting a single asset. Examining the Impact of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation on Key Assets Each of the major cryptocurrencies experienced significant liquidation events, reflecting their individual market dynamics and the broader crypto environment. Ethereum (ETH): $267.94 million, Long 88.76% Ethereum, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often sees high trading activity in its derivatives markets. The substantial $267.94 million in ETH liquidations indicates a significant number of leveraged long positions were caught off guard by a price decline. The high percentage of long liquidations aligns with a general market trend where traders were perhaps overly optimistic about ETH’s immediate price trajectory. Bitcoin (BTC): $164.38 million, Long 93.99% Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, dictates much of the market’s direction. While its total liquidation amount was less than ETH’s, the nearly 94% long liquidation rate for BTC is particularly striking. This suggests an even stronger bullish bias among Bitcoin perpetual futures traders that was severely punished by market movements. BTC’s liquidations can often have a ripple effect, influencing sentiment and price action across the entire crypto ecosystem. Solana (SOL): $41.00 million, Long 90.01% Solana, a prominent altcoin, also experienced considerable liquidations, with over 90% being long positions. This shows that even newer, high-growth assets are not immune to the volatility and leverage-induced risks present in the perpetual futures market. SOL’s liquidations highlight the widespread nature of the recent market correction, affecting various segments of the crypto space. The collective impact of these liquidations underscores the interconnectedness of the crypto market and the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking Truth Behind Market Volatility Actionable Strategies to Mitigate Risks from Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation For traders participating in the perpetual futures market, managing the risk of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation is paramount. While liquidations are an inherent part of leveraged trading, certain strategies can help minimize exposure and protect capital: Prudent Leverage Management: Avoid using excessively high leverage. While 100x leverage might seem appealing for quick gains, it dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Start with lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain more experience and confidence. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predefined point. This is a critical tool to limit potential losses and prevent full liquidation. Maintain Sufficient Margin: Ensure your margin balance is well above the maintenance margin requirement. Consider adding more collateral to your position if the market moves unfavorably, to reduce the risk of liquidation. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into a single highly leveraged position. Diversifying across different assets or trading strategies can help spread risk. Continuous Market Analysis: Stay informed about market trends, technical indicators, and fundamental news. Understanding potential support and resistance levels can help in making more informed trading decisions. Emotional Discipline: Avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Stick to your trading plan and risk management strategy, even during periods of high volatility. By adopting these practices, traders can navigate the volatile landscape of perpetual futures with greater resilience and reduce their susceptibility to significant Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation events. Conclusion: Staying Resilient in the Face of Market Dynamics The recent 24-hour breakdown of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and risks in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. The significant amounts liquidated, especially from long positions, highlight periods of market correction and the consequences of over-leveraging. While these events can be painful for individual traders, they are also a natural part of a maturing market, often cleansing excess leverage and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. For those involved in crypto, the takeaway is clear: knowledge and disciplined risk management are your most valuable assets. Understanding how and why liquidations occur, and implementing robust strategies to protect your capital, will be crucial for long-term success in this dynamic space. The market will always have its ups and downs, but informed participation can make all the difference. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? A1: Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below a certain threshold due to adverse price movements. This prevents further losses to the trader and the exchange. Q2: Why are long liquidations more common during market downturns? A2: Long liquidations are more common during market downturns because long positions profit when prices rise. If the market experiences a sharp decline, these long positions become unprofitable, leading to margin calls and eventual liquidation if the trader cannot or does not add more collateral. Q3: How can traders protect themselves from Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? A3: Traders can protect themselves by using prudent leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, diversifying their portfolio, conducting continuous market analysis, and practicing emotional discipline. Q4: What role does leverage play in liquidations? A4: Leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. Higher leverage means a smaller price movement against your position can lead to liquidation, as your margin is spread thinner. It increases the risk of liquidation significantly. Q5: Do liquidations impact spot prices? A5: Yes, large-scale liquidations can impact spot prices. When positions are liquidated, the underlying assets are often sold off by the exchange to close the position, adding selling pressure to the market and potentially driving down spot prices further, creating a cascading effect. Q6: Which cryptocurrencies are most affected by liquidations? A6: Generally, cryptocurrencies with high trading volume and significant derivatives markets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other popular altcoins like Solana (SOL) or XRP, tend to experience the largest liquidation events due to the sheer volume of leveraged positions.

Yet, for this digital revolution to truly flourish, clear and effective regulation is not just beneficial—it’s essential. Enter the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an agency taking a decisive step to shape the future of digital assets. Their recent announcement of a ‘crypto sprint’ signals a proactive and significant push to bring structure and clarity to this evolving market. This move by the CFTC crypto team aims to solidify the United States’ position as a leader in the global digital asset landscape. What is the CFTC Crypto Sprint All About? On August 1, the CFTC made a pivotal announcement: the launch of a ‘crypto sprint.’ This initiative is not merely a bureaucratic exercise; it is a focused effort to jumpstart the implementation of key recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham emphasized the agency’s rapid pace, aligning with the broader objective of establishing the U.S. as a global crypto hub. This sprint is a testament to the CFTC’s commitment to adapting its regulatory framework to the unique characteristics of digital assets. It signifies a shift from observation to active participation in shaping the market’s trajectory. The initiative seeks to: Address regulatory gaps and provide clarity for market participants. Foster innovation while ensuring robust investor protection. Coordinate efforts with other key financial regulators to create a cohesive approach. The CFTC crypto sprint is designed to be agile, allowing the agency to quickly develop and implement policies that support responsible growth in the digital asset space. It’s about building a strong foundation for the future. Initiative Component Key Objective / Role CFTC Crypto Sprint Accelerate implementation of digital asset recommendations. President’s Working Group Source of foundational digital asset recommendations. Project Crypto Broader, coordinated initiative with SEC. Pilot Program for Digital Asset Markets Weighing experimental approaches for market oversight. Industry Tokenization Efforts CFTC to assume an observer role in this evolving area. Why is This CFTC Crypto Initiative a Game-Changer for the US? The CFTC’s aggressive push into digital asset regulation holds significant promise for the United States. This isn’t just about creating rules; it’s about fostering an environment where innovation can thrive responsibly. By actively engaging with the crypto space, the CFTC aims to: Enhance Market Integrity: Clear regulations reduce uncertainty, deter illicit activities, and build confidence among institutional and retail investors. This is crucial for attracting capital and talent. Foster Innovation: A well-defined regulatory landscape provides a predictable environment for businesses to develop new products and services without fear of sudden, disruptive policy changes. This clarity can unlock significant entrepreneurial energy. Boost Global Competitiveness: If the U.S. establishes a clear and forward-thinking regulatory framework, it can attract digital asset businesses from around the world, making it a true global crypto hub. This strategic advantage is vital in the rapidly evolving international financial landscape. Protect Consumers and Investors: One of the primary drivers behind regulatory action is safeguarding those who participate in these markets. By setting standards for transparency, disclosure, and operational integrity, the CFTC crypto initiatives aim to minimize risks for everyday users. This proactive stance positions the U.S. not as a barrier to crypto, but as a facilitator of its responsible evolution. Navigating the Complexities of CFTC Crypto Oversight While the intent behind the CFTC’s crypto sprint is commendable, the path to effective regulation is fraught with complexities. The digital asset landscape presents unique challenges that traditional financial regulations were not designed to address. Some key hurdles include: Jurisdictional Clarity: The line between a commodity and a security in the crypto space can be blurry, leading to ongoing debates about whether the CFTC or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has primary oversight for certain assets. This requires careful coordination and potentially new legislative clarity. Technological Evolution: The pace of innovation in blockchain and digital assets is incredibly fast. Regulators must stay abreast of new technologies, consensus mechanisms, and use cases to create relevant and effective rules without stifling progress. Global Coordination: Digital assets transcend national borders. Effective regulation requires international cooperation to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure a consistent approach to global markets. The CFTC crypto efforts will need to consider international standards and practices. Balancing Innovation and Risk: The challenge lies in striking the right balance. Overly strict regulations could stifle innovation and drive businesses offshore, while insufficient oversight could expose investors to undue risk. Overcoming these challenges will require ongoing dialogue, adaptability, and a deep understanding of both financial markets and blockchain technology. How Does Project Crypto Propel Digital Asset Evolution? The CFTC’s crypto sprint is part of a broader, more encompassing initiative dubbed ‘Project Crypto.’ This larger framework underscores a concerted effort by U.S. regulators to establish a comprehensive and coordinated approach to digital assets. A key aspect of Project Crypto is the explicit coordination with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce. This inter-agency collaboration is vital because many digital assets can potentially fall under the purview of both agencies, depending on their structure and use case. The coordination aims to: Reduce Regulatory Ambiguity: By working together, the CFTC and SEC can clarify which assets fall under which regulatory umbrella, providing much-needed certainty for market participants. Harmonize Enforcement: A unified approach can lead to more consistent enforcement actions, ensuring fair play across the board. Leverage Combined Expertise: Both agencies bring unique perspectives and expertise to the table, which, when combined, can lead to more robust and effective policies for the CFTC crypto and SEC crypto landscapes. Beyond inter-agency coordination, Project Crypto is also exploring a pilot program for digital asset markets. Such programs often involve creating regulatory ‘sandboxes’ where new technologies and business models can be tested under controlled conditions, allowing regulators to learn and adapt without imposing immediate, broad-sweeping rules. Furthermore, the CFTC’s role as an observer in industry tokenization efforts highlights its commitment to understanding and potentially influencing the foundational shifts occurring in asset ownership and transfer through blockchain technology. This foresight ensures the agency remains relevant and responsive to market developments. Actionable Insights for the Future of CFTC Crypto For anyone involved in the digital asset space—from developers and entrepreneurs to investors and financial institutions—the CFTC’s proactive stance offers several key insights: Stay Informed: The regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly. Regularly monitor official announcements from the CFTC, SEC, and other relevant bodies. Subscribing to regulatory updates and engaging with industry associations can provide crucial insights. Prepare for Compliance: Businesses operating in the digital asset space should begin assessing their operations against potential future regulations. This might involve enhancing internal controls, strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and preparing for potential registration requirements. Engage with Policymakers: The CFTC has shown a willingness to engage with the industry. Providing constructive feedback and sharing insights on how regulations might impact innovation can be beneficial. Industry participation in public comment periods is vital. Embrace Transparency: As regulators focus on market integrity, transparency will become increasingly important. Projects and platforms that prioritize clear communication, robust auditing, and strong governance will be better positioned for success. Diversify Knowledge: Understanding both the technological aspects of digital assets and the intricacies of financial regulation is becoming indispensable. For investors, this means not just understanding market trends but also the regulatory environment that shapes them. The future of CFTC crypto interactions will demand this holistic understanding. These insights underscore the importance of proactivity and adaptability in navigating the exciting, yet complex, world of digital assets. Conclusion The U.S. CFTC’s launch of its ‘crypto sprint’ and the broader ‘Project Crypto’ initiative marks a significant turning point for digital asset regulation in the United States. This decisive move underscores a clear commitment to fostering innovation, protecting investors, and positioning the U.S. as a dominant force in the global digital economy. While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead in navigating the complexities of this nascent industry, the coordinated efforts between the CFTC and SEC, alongside considerations for pilot programs and industry tokenization, demonstrate a thoughtful and ambitious approach. This bold stride by the CFTC crypto team is not just about establishing rules; it’s about building a robust, secure, and thriving ecosystem where digital assets can realize their full potential, ultimately benefiting consumers, businesses, and the broader economy.

As Bitcoin holds above support and Ethereum consolidates near $3,700, attention is shifting fast. Large-cap coins are showing signs of exhaustion trending dashboards are zeroing in on small-cap tokens with faster upside. This pattern isn’t new—it mirrors previous market transitions where capital moved into low-float coins with stronger narrative velocity. As influencers revive talk of “altcoin season,” wallets are already repositioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the early-stage tokens now entering this speculative spotlight . Ethereum’s early breakout still echoes in investor playbooks In 2016–2017, Ethereum shocked traditionalists by turning early $1,000 entries into life-changing gains . The secret wasn’t luck—it was early conviction and entry before major listings or institutional access. Today, similar dynamics are playing out with new projects that offer high-engagement communities, limited access windows , and public roadmaps. ETH’s initial adoption cycle created a template: real upside lives at the edges of visibility, not the center. Analysts now advise watching which tokens are mirroring that early stage pattern in both momentum and structure. Growth, that draws Ethereum-era comparisons This is exactly where MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating interest. Analysts have begun positioning its current momentum alongside Ethereum’s breakout years , noting key similarities: surging retail traction, limited early access, and an expanding roadmap with future listings in view. Unlike passive meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to deliver on development and community participation, with July setting all-time highs in wallet creation and daily Telegram growth . With exclusive access open now and market visibility climbing rapidly, forward-looking investors are eyeing what could be another early-stage cycle. Some are framing this moment as a rare ETH-style setup – before institutional attention enters. The best opportunities emerge before the spotlight arrives When attention turns to altcoins, the best performers are rarely those already trending on Coinbase or Binance. Instead, it’s the tokens that build momentum early , lock in loyalty, and limit supply flow that explode once retail floods in. Today’s altcoin watchers are preparing—not reacting. They’re evaluating access mechanics, social engagement velocity, and project credibility. And while not every coin can follow Ethereum’s trajectory, those that demonstrate similar foundational traits—community, scarcity, roadmap—are being studied carefully. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE now find themselves at the center of these evaluations. Conclusion: MAGACOIN FINANCE enters ETH-like early phase, say analysts History never repeats – but it often rhymes. Ethereum’s rise started with narrative strength and user engagement, not institutional backing. Today, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed as one of the few tokens capturing that same early-stage momentum , with analysts drawing sharp parallels to ETH’s formative cycle.

Sharp shifts in several key metrics, such as open interest and net taker volume, confirm the intensity of the sell-off. Bitcoin Decline Wipes Out $500 Million In Open Interest According to a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant by contributor Amr Taha, BTC’s drop below $115,000 led to a sharp decline in open interest on Binance, which fell from $14 billion to under $13.5 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejected At $120,000: Binance Whale Inflows Suggest Possible Drop To $110,000 The following chart shows Binance open interest declining by nearly 4% in a single day – a move typically associated with liquidation events. Supporting this, data from CoinGlass shows $760 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. To explain, such large-scale liquidation events typically occur when leveraged traders face forced position closures – long or short – due to margin calls. The sharp BTC drop resulted in the liquidation of approximately 183,514 traders in just 24 hours. In addition to falling open interest and widespread long liquidations, Binance’s net taker volume also points to rising bearish sentiment. The metric plunged to -$160 million, underscoring aggressive selling pressure. For context, Binance net taker volume measures the difference between market buy and sell orders initiated by takers. A positive value suggests dominant buying activity (bullish), while a negative value reflects dominant selling activity (bearish). Binance net taker volume dropping into negative territory further reinforces bearish pressure on BTC. Since this net selling coincided with the decline in open interest, it indicates that many derivatives traders are panic-closing late long positions. Will BTC Make Recovery? Despite the falling price, shrinking open interest, and negative net taker volume, Taha suggests that these bearish indicators could paradoxically set the stage for a short-term rebound. Related Reading: Bitcoin Overheating Signals Easing – Is A Second-Half Rally Ahead? Bitcoin’s selling pressure may be nearing exhaustion, while short interest continues to rise. This combination could trigger a market rebalancing phase, potentially paving the way for price stabilization – or even a short squeeze-driven bounce. However, on-chain data points to continued bearish momentum. The increasing share of new investors among BTC holders may lead to overheated market conditions in the near term. At the same time, exchange reserves are rising, which could contribute to more selling pressure. Long-term BTC holders also appear to be selling in significant volumes, suggesting potential rally exhaustion. That said, BTC could still remain on track for its year-end target of $180,000 – but only if it holds key support at $110,000. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $115,310, down 2.1% over the past 24 hours.

With Bitcoin dominance slipping and ETF-driven capital rotations favoring smaller caps, attention is rapidly turning toward underexposed tokens with viral upside potential. Across social platforms, Telegram groups, and trending dashboard, there’s a clear pattern: early-access tokens with meme appeal and limited supply are generating the loudest buzz. These aren’t random bets – they’re narrative-driven assets that align with historical patterns seen in SHIB and other major runs. Timing, community traction, and visibility now matter more than ever, especially before CEX listings unlock mainstream entry. In this shifting environment, investors are positioning where momentum is just beginning—not already priced in. One such token increasingly being discussed in this breakout category is MAGACOIN FINANCE, as its visibility grows across retail channels and early – access demand rises quickly. SHIBA INU’s 2021 run proves the power of early timing SHIBA INU made history in 2021 after rising from obscurity to deliver over 40,000,000% gains in a single year. It became a case study in how powerful timing, early community traction, and viral market dynamics can create life-changing outcomes. While not every token replicates SHIB’s path, the story reinforced a clear lesson: those who positioned themselves early , before centralized listings and media buzz, were the ones who captured the real upside. That kind of setup doesn’t appear often – but when it does, it’s usually brief. MAGACOIN FINANCE tops crypto trending charts as early access closes Now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing signs of entering that same breakout phase. Over the past few weeks, it has consistently ranked on top crypto trend lists – driven by wallet growth, social engagement, and accelerating demand for access. What makes this moment unique is the structural setup: the project is still in exclusive early access , and that access is rapidly approaching capacity. With limited supply, growing visibility, and a utility-focused roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads as a project that pairs timing with real momentum. For many watching the space, this is being marked as a potential breakout candidate before it reaches broader exposure. History shows early-phase tokens can deliver massive upside Every market cycle produces a few projects that go from under-the-radar to explosive returns—but it’s rarely after they hit major exchanges. Instead, it’s the tokens that show sharp organic engagement, time-limited access, and a building narrative that capture the earliest and most aggressive moves. While nothing is guaranteed, many investors now understand that projects with those ingredients—like rapid trending chart momentum and closing early access phases – can sometimes deliver outcomes reminiscent of SHIBA INU’s rise. The window for such setups doesn’t last long. Conclusion: The setup is here—will history repeat? As MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate crypto trending lists and early-access demand pushes allocation limits, the comparisons to early SHIBA INU are no longer hypothetical—they’re actively being discussed across the space. This phase, before major listings or mass media coverage, is when serious upside has historically emerged . The question is whether this will be another fleeting trend or the beginning of something much larger. Those tracking timing, scarcity, and trend momentum already know what kind of setups to watch.

Price charts swing, trends form, and some digital currencies remain steady with meaningful progress. Right now, four names are commanding attention across user groups: BlockDAG, Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Tron (TRX). While each project has its own growth path, they all are gaining traction for different reasons: tech progress, market entries, and powerful use cases. For anyone checking the current list of top cryptos to watch now, these four offer serious reasons to be considered. Let’s break down what makes them stand out and why their moves suggest longer-term traction, not just short-term hype. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): $0.0016 Price Tag Available Until August 11 Among the top cryptos to watch now, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers a rare early entry point at just $0.0016 until August 11. Its presale has already raised $358 million and sold over 24.6 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the strongest performers in presale history. Despite reaching batch 29, it remains accessible to new buyers, adding to its rapid momentum. The coin’s early supporters have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. With a projected launch price of $0.05, some analysts estimate potential climbs toward $1 or even higher. Adoption is strong: 200,000+ holders, 4,500 developers working on 300+ Web3 dApps, and over 2.5 million daily users mining via the X1 app. Since the recent demo of both the X1 app and X10 miner, BlockDAG’s exposure has expanded quickly. The increasing demand and daily price increments between batches are shrinking the profit window. Among the top cryptos to watch now, BlockDAG offers one of the lowest entry points paired with high community backing. 2. Binance Coin (BNB): Big Buyers Signal Long-Term Play Large financial entities have begun shifting major funds into BNB, signaling strong support behind its growth. Two publicly traded firms recently bought over $500M worth of Binance Coin each, pointing to a fresh corporate interest in crypto assets. Priced near $830.74, BNB had gained 8.6% over the past week before slightly correcting from its $861.20 peak. BNB is evolving past its original exchange-linked appeal. Today, it’s showing up in corporate strategies and financial forecasts. With market watchers predicting a $1,000 breakout, it secures its place among the top cryptos to watch now. Institutional adoption is a serious driver, often setting the pace for broader market movements. 3. Cardano (ADA): Whale Positioning and Real-World Tech Utility Cardano recently took a small dip, falling by over 10% and trading near $0.79. But behind the scenes, big holders are making careful moves. One whale removed 271 million ADA, roughly $218 million, from exchanges, likely planning to hold it long term. Another significant update is Cardano’s support for Apple Pay. This step opens up accessibility to global retail users and may reshape how ADA is used in everyday transactions. Its combination of deep-pocket backing and expanding payment integration positions Cardano firmly as one of the top cryptos to watch now. 4. Tron (TRX): Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Tron is building bridges between blockchain and legacy finance. After its Nasdaq-linked debut via Tron Inc., the project announced a $1 billion plan to expand through new financial instruments. The team itself holds over 365 million TRX, reinforcing its commitment. Currently trading at $0.3236 with a 2.9% weekly uptick, TRX has overtaken Cardano in market cap rankings. Its ability to grow in both regulated and decentralized spaces gives it a dual edge. That’s what places Tron comfortably among the top cryptos to watch now. Final Words! BNB’s institutional support keeps growing, Cardano is aligning itself with payment giants like Apple, and Tron is proving it can scale both inside and outside blockchain circles. Then there’s BlockDAG, a project with $358M already raised, 24.6B coins sold, and presale price of $0.0016 still open until August 11. Early buyers have already seen a 2,660% growth since batch 1, and the project shows strong daily user engagement. Among the top cryptos to watch now, BlockDAG’s early entry price and massive developer ecosystem make it especially attractive. Whether it’s corporate backing, whale action, payment integration, or a presale with real scale, each of these names earns its place in the list of top cryptos to watch now .

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will lift its ban on retail access to cryptoasset-backed exchange-traded notes (cETNs) starting October 8, 2025. This decision follows a consultation launched in June and reflects what the regulator calls a more mature market for these products. Retail investors will be able to trade cETNs listed on FCA-recognised UK investment exchanges. However, the FCA confirmed that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail clients will remain in place.

Pressure on liquidity and whale rebalancing are drawing sharp attention to assets that combine limited access with growth momentum—and as a result, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been quietly generating buzz with whale demand surging behind it. Pepe (PEPE) gains renewed traction amid meme resurgence Pepe Coin (PEPE) recently jumped approximately 20% in a month, signaling renewed interest among meme‑coin traders. It has rebounded from a key support level, with bullish price action driving renewed momentum. Analysts caution that its massive supply caps higher price targets, but the burst in social activity and retail attention suggests it remains a powerful play for short‑term volatility. MAGACOIN FINANCE accelerates as whale-led demand spikes While these smaller meme coins draw bigger attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing backdoor accumulation from whale investors, helping drive its momentum into overdrive. Whales are accumulating , and demand for early access is rising rapidly across wallet signups, community activity, and trending charts. The project’s structured early-access system – exclusive entry open now but nearing capacity – paired with growing utility and ecosystem momentum, positions it as one of the few tokens remaining where timing still matters. For investors seeking big gains, this is a standout setup fueled by calculated capital behavior, not just hype . Bonk (BONK) builds momentum ahead of supply‑reduction catalyst Bonk (BONK), trading under $1, continues to gain traction as it approaches the milestone of 1 million on-chain holders, which will trigger a planned 1 trillion token burn, reducing overall supply. The token surged recently, supported by on-chain growth and hype around deflationary mechanics, though some retracement is expected at resistance around $0.00003. Why the sub‑$1 bracket is catching smart money History shows that the most explosive gains in crypto often come from coins trading at cents , not dollars. When liquidity exits large caps, it tends to flow into early‑stage projects with strong narratives and limited cap exposure. Investors now prioritize transparent token structures, growing engagement, and strategic access phases – benchmarks seen across the top performers of past cycles. Conclusion: Keep your radar tight on under‑$1 setups Sector momentum is real—but for those with capital ready and patience intact, under‑$1 tokens like PEPE and BONK may deliver fast-moving gains. Even more compelling is MAGACOIN FINANCE, whose whale-led demand and fast‑filling access window combine scarcity with structure. In a market where meaningful upside often occurs before visibility peaks, acting now may give you a tactical edge as the sector cycles again.

Most recently, the downtrend intensified with sellers making their presence known by taking the price to the $3 support level. If they manage to break it later, then bears will be able to test the support at $2.7. Chart by TradingView 2. Momentum Stays Bearish In the past two weeks, the momentum turned bearish for XRP. Both the MACD and the RSI indicators crossed into bearish territory and continue to make lower lows at the time of this post. This indicates that the correction is in full swing and there is no reversal in sight yet. Chart by TradingView 3. Sellers Dominate A quick look at the volume profile shows that in the last 15 days, sellers have absolutely dominated by closing five consecutive 3-day candles in red. This is slightly atypical considering that XRP had such a strong rally prior to this. However, the volume profile is making lower lows, which indicates exhaustion from sellers.

This incredible achievement, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at $114,000 on the Binance USDT market. This unprecedented Bitcoin Price Surge marks a pivotal moment, capturing the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts globally. It signifies not just a numerical ascent but a profound shift in market sentiment and the digital asset’s growing influence in global finance. This article delves into the significance of this surge, the forces propelling it, potential challenges, and what it might mean for the future of the crypto landscape. What Does This $114,000 Milestone Mean for the Bitcoin Price Surge? Reaching $114,000 is far more than just another price point for Bitcoin; it is a powerful statement about its enduring strength and potential. This level represents a new frontier, challenging previous expectations and setting a new benchmark for digital asset valuation. Its implications are multi-faceted: Psychological Breakthrough: Surpassing such a significant figure often triggers a psychological cascade, encouraging more investors to enter the market, fearing they might miss out on further gains. It reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value. Increased Mainstream Validation: Each new all-time high attracts greater media attention and public discussion, further cementing Bitcoin’s legitimacy in mainstream finance. This validates the asset for institutional and retail investors alike. Enhanced Market Capitalization: A higher price directly translates to a larger market capitalization, making Bitcoin a more substantial asset class comparable to traditional financial instruments and even major corporations. Liquidity and Trading Volume: Price surges typically correlate with increased trading activity, boosting liquidity across exchanges and making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. This momentous rise suggests a robust underlying demand and a maturing market infrastructure capable of supporting such valuations. The Bitcoin Price Surge at this level indicates strong conviction among holders and a willingness to acquire the asset at higher prices. Key Drivers Behind the Unprecedented Bitcoin Price Surge Several powerful forces have converged to propel Bitcoin to this extraordinary valuation. Understanding these drivers is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of the current market rally: Driver Impact on Bitcoin Price Surge Institutional Adoption Major financial institutions, corporations, and hedge funds are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class. This influx of large capital significantly boosts demand and stability. Macroeconomic Factors Concerns over inflation, currency debasement, and global economic uncertainty push investors towards Bitcoin as a digital hedge or ‘digital gold,’ a safe haven asset. Supply Halving Events Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reduction (halving) decreases the rate at which new BTC enters circulation, creating scarcity. Reduced supply against consistent or rising demand naturally drives prices higher. Technological Advancements Ongoing improvements to Bitcoin’s network, such as the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, enhance its utility and scalability, making it more attractive for wider use. Retail Investor Interest Increased accessibility through user-friendly platforms and growing awareness contribute to a broad base of retail investors entering the market, adding significant buying pressure. These elements combine to create a powerful bullish momentum, demonstrating Bitcoin’s evolving role from a niche digital currency to a significant global financial asset, underpinning the current Bitcoin Price Surge . Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Risks for the Bitcoin Price Surge? While the recent surge is exciting, it is important to approach the market with a clear understanding of potential challenges and risks. Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant volatility, and a price point of $114,000 does not eliminate this inherent characteristic. Investors should be aware of: Market Corrections: Sharp rallies are often followed by corrections as profits are taken. A significant price drop after a peak is a normal market behavior. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could impact market sentiment and price. Security Concerns: While Bitcoin’s blockchain is secure, individual exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacks, leading to potential loss of funds. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin (whales) can significantly influence market prices through their buying and selling activities, creating unpredictable swings. Economic Headwinds: Broader economic downturns or shifts in global monetary policy could impact investor appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Prudent investors consider these factors and implement risk management strategies to protect their portfolios, even amidst a powerful Bitcoin Price Surge . Actionable Insights for Investors: Capitalizing on the Bitcoin Price Surge For those looking to engage with Bitcoin during this exciting period, a strategic approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing, thoroughly research Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and historical performance. Understand what you are investing in. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a single large investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility and can be effective during a Bitcoin Price Surge or downturns. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one asset. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies or traditional assets can help manage risk. Set Clear Investment Goals: Define your investment horizon (short-term vs. long-term) and your risk tolerance. This will guide your decisions during market fluctuations. Secure Your Holdings: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for larger holdings to enhance security against cyber threats. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, market analysis, and regulatory updates. Knowledge is power in a rapidly evolving market. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results. Investment in cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks, and it is possible to lose capital. The Future Outlook: What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Surge? With Bitcoin now firmly established above $114,000, the question on everyone’s mind is: what comes next? While no one can predict the future with certainty, several factors suggest continued growth and evolution for Bitcoin. The trend of institutional adoption is expected to accelerate. As more traditional financial products tied to Bitcoin emerge (e.g., ETFs), accessibility for a broader range of investors will increase. This could lead to even greater capital inflows and potentially sustain the Bitcoin Price Surge over the long term. Furthermore, as global economies continue to navigate complex challenges, Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, scarce asset may become even more appealing as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Technological developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as advancements in scaling solutions and enhanced privacy features, will also play a role in its future utility and adoption. As the network becomes more efficient and user-friendly, its appeal for everyday transactions could grow, further solidifying its position. However, the path forward will likely not be linear. Regulatory clarity, global economic conditions, and technological competition will all influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Despite potential short-term fluctuations, the fundamental drivers of scarcity, decentralization, and increasing utility position Bitcoin for a significant role in the future of finance. Bitcoin’s journey to $114,000 is a testament to its growing influence and the evolving landscape of digital finance. Bitcoin Price Surge: BTC Soars Past $114,000 The monumental rise of Bitcoin past $114,000 is a truly historic moment in the cryptocurrency landscape. It underscores the growing confidence in digital assets and Bitcoin’s unique position as a leader in this financial revolution. While the journey has been marked by volatility, the underlying strength, increasing adoption, and fundamental drivers suggest a future where Bitcoin continues to challenge traditional financial paradigms. This incredible Bitcoin Price Surge is not just a fleeting event but a significant indicator of a maturing asset class poised for continued relevance and impact in the global economy. As the market evolves, staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective remains paramount for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does the $114,000 price point signify for Bitcoin? The $114,000 price point signifies a new all-time high and a major psychological breakthrough for Bitcoin. It demonstrates strong market confidence, increased institutional and retail adoption, and reinforces its growing status as a significant global asset class. What are the primary factors driving the current Bitcoin Price Surge? Key drivers include increased institutional investment, macroeconomic concerns leading investors to seek hedges against inflation, Bitcoin’s supply halving events reducing new supply, ongoing technological improvements to the network, and growing retail investor interest and accessibility. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after such a significant price increase? Investing in Bitcoin always carries risks. While the price has surged, many analysts believe Bitcoin has long-term growth potential. It is crucial to conduct your own research, understand your risk tolerance, and consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) rather than making a single large investment. What are the main risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility at this level? Despite the high price, Bitcoin remains volatile. Risks include potential sharp market corrections, evolving regulatory landscapes, security vulnerabilities (like exchange hacks), and the influence of large holders (whales) on price movements. It is important to manage risk and only invest what you can afford to lose. How does institutional adoption influence Bitcoin’s value? Institutional adoption significantly influences Bitcoin’s value by bringing substantial capital, increased liquidity, and mainstream legitimacy to the market. When large financial entities and corporations invest, it signals confidence and can lead to sustained demand and price stability over time. What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin after this surge? The long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains largely positive, driven by its finite supply, decentralization, and increasing utility. Continued institutional interest, technological advancements, and its role as a potential hedge against traditional financial instability are expected to support its growth, though price movements will likely remain volatile.

Bloomberg’s review of Bank of England data showed that despite four rate cuts since July last year and more likely to come, households are about $14.5 billion worse off each year than 12 months ago. This shortfall comes even though the Monetary Policy Committee cut its key rate from 5.25% over that period. Savers have felt the pinch as banks and cut rates on deposits, reducing returns on cash. Homeowners have not seen similar relief, since many are on mortgage deals agreed at the peak of borrowing costs and must wait for those terms to expire. These numbers underline the challenge for policymakers to reduce pressure for households and revive the weak growth in Britain, as they work to reduce the benchmark rate that was at 5.25% a year ago, highest since the global credit crunch. Earlier in April, Cryptopolitan reported that the Bank of England cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25%. Consumer spending makes up about 60% of the UK economy, and any recovery hinges on people spending more. But many remain cautious, saving money amid fears of further tax rises in the autumn. A GfK savings index rose in July to its strongest level since 2007. Bank of England to cut another 0.25 percentage point off the main rate The Bank of England is expected to shave another 0.25 percentage point off its main rate, taking it to 4% this Thursday with signs of the labor market is cooling following Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ April tax increases and rising global trade tensions. Yet inflation is at a 17-month high, running hotter than the Bank forecast in May. Governor Andrew Bailey is expected to urge caution on further easing. While energy bills and other temporary factors have driven prices up, officials fear that higher wage demands could push costs even higher. Lower rates have cost savers nearly £5 billion in lost earnings on cash deposits, including tax-free Individual Savings Accounts as well as time and sight accounts, based on the total stock of deposits and effective rates through the last year. Furthermore, households are paying about £6 billion more each year in interest on unsecured debts and mortgages than they were 12 months ago. In comparison, the US household debt also hit a record $18.2 trillion, based on an earlier report by Cryptopolitan . The Bank warns more borrowers will shift onto higher rates in the coming months, estimating that a typical homeowner could pay about £1,300 extra a year in mortgage costs over the coming 2 years. Approximately 1 million people have fixed deals above today’s rates and must wait before benefiting from cheaper credit. Since July 2024, just before the first cut, the average rate rose by about 0.2 percentage points on on the UK’s mortgage stock. Economists expect the Bank of England to stick to its easing cycle once every quarter, taking rates to approximately 3.5% by spring, 2026. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Analyst Sees $5 Surge Any Moment – Details While the token’s price briefly dipped following the news, long-term indicators suggest this move could be a major bullish trigger. Asset Managers Revise Solana ETF Filings Amid SEC Dialogue As of August 1, at least seven asset managers submitted amended S-1 registration statements for Solana-based ETFs. These updates, which now include staking provisions and clearer custodianship structures, reflect ongoing discussions with the SEC. Notably, Grayscale’s updated proposal introduces a 2.5% annual fee in SOL, while VanEck’s version includes active staking rewards and dual custodianship. These moves are viewed as part of a coordinated strategy to align with SEC expectations, especially after the Commission recently approved in-kind redemption structures for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Market watchers believe a decision on Solana ETFs could arrive as early as late August or September 2025. SOL Price Reacts Cautiously, But Long-Term Momentum Builds Surprisingly, Solana’s price dropped by over 3% following the ETF filings, closing at $170.24. This suggests the news may already be priced in, or that traders remain cautious amid broader market uncertainty. Technical indicators show bearish momentum, with SOL struggling to stay above key support zones at $170 and $158. A close above $180 could reignite bullish sentiment, while a drop below $158 may signal a deeper correction toward $145 or $130.

A greenlight from the SEC could legitimize Solana as a mainstream investment asset, increase market liquidity, and open the door for more institutional adoption. With over $60 billion in staked SOL and a maturing ecosystem, Solana is well-positioned to benefit once regulatory clarity arrives.

Historically, Q3 has often served as a catalyst for altcoin breakouts following summer consolidation. While Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range and Ethereum navigates ETF speculation, several under-the-radar altcoins are rapidly gaining traction – driven by community hype, viral narratives, and emerging utility. Crypto analysts are now paying close attention to five specific projects poised to outperform in the coming weeks. These coins represent a mix of meme-driven momentum, infrastructure utility, and cross-sector growth potential. One standout is MAGACOIN FINANCE, recently flagged by multiple analysts for its staggering 14,200% upside potential . Others, like PENGU and Jeo Boden, are riding powerful waves of community interest, while more technically grounded tokens like RNDR and SUI continue to expand through developer adoption and real-world applications. Here’s a closer look at the five altcoins analysts are closely watching before the next market breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Flag 14,200% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly risen through the ranks of trending crypto projects. Fueled by political appeal and a deeply engaged base, it has already surpassed several key presale milestones. Analysts project a possible 14,200% return , citing parallels to early-stage SHIB and DOGE cycles. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE goes beyond meme hype – it leverages scarcity-driven tokenomics, social referrals, and strategic deflation mechanisms that give it a unique edge in the crowded meme coin space. With viral content spreading across social media platforms, MAGACOIN is becoming a dominant force in the current presale cycle. Jeo Boden: A Political Meme Coin With Relentless Momentum Jeo Boden is a parody-driven meme coin inspired by political themes and Gen-Z humor. What started as a fringe project has now exploded across social media, consistently trending on DEXTools and amassing a loyal holder base. Its cultural relevance and satirical tone have fueled a wave of speculative buying. While it’s intentionally unserious in tone, traders are taking it seriously—many viewing it as a high-upside play in the meme coin narrative of 2025. PENGU: Meme-NFT Hybrid Making Exchange History PENGU has quickly cemented its status as one of the most exchange-listed meme tokens in recent memory. With over 130 listings and growing, PENGU blends NFT utility with meme coin virality. Its expansion into plush toys, NFT drops, and influencer partnerships makes it stand out from traditional meme projects. Analysts believe its ability to bridge Web3 culture with mainstream merchandising could give it longevity far beyond the current cycle. Render (RNDR): AI Infrastructure Backed by Real Demand Render is increasingly seen as one of the few AI-related crypto tokens with real-world utility. By decentralizing GPU rendering across creative industries, RNDR is building the backbone for future metaverse and AI integrations. As demand for AI infrastructure intensifies, Render’s growth in both institutional adoption and developer use cases makes it a reliable mid-cap play with long-term potential. SUI: A High-Speed Layer 1 Gaining Ecosystem Support SUI continues to attract developers and funding thanks to its focus on high throughput, fast finality, and user-friendly design. Developed by Mysten Labs, SUI offers a scalable alternative to congested Layer 1s like Ethereum. Its rapidly growing ecosystem and strong community support suggest it may be one of the best-positioned L1s heading into the next phase of market expansion. Conclusion: As August approaches, these five tokens are gaining momentum across different corners of the crypto world. Whether it’s the meme-powered explosion of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Jeo Boden, the NFT utility of PENGU, or the infrastructure strength of RNDR and SUI, each project is attracting serious analyst attention. MAGACOIN’s 14,200% upside potential stands out as one of the most aggressive forecasts—but in crypto, early conviction often leads to life-changing returns. With sentiment shifting bullish, positioning ahead of time may prove to be a winning strategy.

New Listings Could Spark Surge in 2025,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/pi-coin-breakout-incoming-new-listings-could-spark-surge-in-2025/,"Pi Network has just integrated TransFi, a secure fiat on‑ramp solution available to over 70 countries , supporting 40+ currencies and 250+ payment methods, including credit cards and Apple Pay. This move eliminates the multi‑step conversion process, letting users in developing markets access Pi directly and seamlessly. With trading volume surging toward $80 million , and a fully diluted valuation around $41.2 billion , the upgrade sets Pi up for broader mainstream participation. As investor enthusiasm shifts toward tokens with real liquidity paths and arrival potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly catching attention for reaching an all‑time peak in market visibility and community buzz. Listings, utility, and speculation: What may drive Pi toward $2 Currently trading in the $0.40–$0.41 range, Pi Coin’s next major move hinges on momentum from exchange listings and ecosystem expansion. Some analysts suggest a move toward $0.75 to $2 later in 2025 if global deployments and volume growth continue. Technically, price action has shown a breakout above the key $0.42 falling wedge – a chart pattern often signaling bullish reversal. However, risks remain, including rising exchange supply and user-reported wallet issues. Analysts recommend watching circulation data and listing confirmations closely. V isibility all-time high as demand surges While Pi Coin captures headlines for fiat onboarding, MAGACOIN FINANCE is celebrating its own breakthrough in early – phase momentum. In July, the project consistently topped crypto trend dashboards and saw record-breaking community growth across the industry. Whale investors are quietly accumulating, driving visibility and demand beyond typical retail activity. With early-access still open but nearing capacity, MAGACOIN’s rare mix of limited supply, rising buzz, and expanding utility mirrors setups that historically preceded major moves. For those timing cycles, it’s now one of the most structured asymmetric plays on the table. Timing and narrative: Where early-stage plays stand apart Success in crypto often comes from pairing narrative momentum with timing and scarcity—long before tokens hit major exchanges. Pi Coin now offers fiat access and regulatory momentum, but it may still be constrained by supply dynamics. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is weaving that narrative into its early phase – with chart trends and whale activity signaling shifting capital. In past cycles, projects like this amplified sharply once buy-side interest converged with limited entry . Watching for access window closing, surging buzz, and development updates may be the best way to separate lasting opportunities from fleeting hype. Conclusion: Access, visibility, and narrative in sharp focus Pi Coin’s integration with TransFi could mark the start of a new growth chapter. But in the background, MAGACOIN FINANCE is hitting all-time highs in market visibility – and entering what many believe is its last early-access window. Whether Pi approaches $2 or not, timing is everything right now. When visibility , buzz , and scarcity overlap, opportunities often favor those who act early. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is precisely the kind of asset positioning itself for a potential breakout as broader recognition still lags.

Two sources knowledgeable of the situation explained these delays , stating that the government faces internal challenges threatening to stop the approval process completely. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a key figure in Trump’s trade negotiations and tariff policies, is now facing criticism. His department is being accused of stalling critical trade operations. His team has failed to release anticipated trade regulations, maintained minimal communication with industry stakeholders, and suffered a wave of resignations and buyouts that reduced its pool of specialized staff, crippling its ability to function effectively. BIS delays approval processes for export license applications Earlier, Nvidia announced that officials in Washington had promised to approve its shipments of AI chips to China. Examples of these officials include Lutnick. However, reports reveal that their license has been delayed, diminishing the U.S. companies’ hope to initiate distribution soon. Considering the situation, one of the U.S. officials acknowledged that this was the highest number of license applications in history. Lutnick’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) team also raised security concerns surrounding these license applications. In a statement, an anonymous official said the Bureau of Industry and Security is imposing strict regulations and aggressive enforcement to align with President Donald Trump’s trade policies—disrupting the market. Individuals who wished to expand their business overseas and tech companies that aimed for stringent export rules expressed their disappointment in the agency. According to them, this demonstrates a lack of action, yet the agency’s role is to enhance international trade. Meghan Harris, who worked as an official on the National Security Council during the first Trump administration, has commented on the matter. Harris noted that concerning the operation of enterprises within the United States, licensing as an activity supports the economy and reinforces the position of the U.S. as a trading superpower. Hence, in light of her reasoning, these delays and uncertainties about the licensing approval process are a net negative concerning many aspects of their economy. Jeffrey Kessler’s action raises controversy among individuals The licensing process is one of the U.S. rules in the export sector, to monitor the movement of sensitive products and tech devices from getting into the wrong hands, threatening the country’s security. In March, individuals raised concerns about BIS’s under-secretary, Jeffrey Kessler’s practices of micromanaging the bureau and his lack of effective communication. These concerns were raised after Kessler asked BIS staff to minimize communication with company spokespeople and industry executives during a staff meeting. Later, he asked that all meetings be noted in a spreadsheet. This also includes staff requesting permission from Kessler’s office to join meetings with other government agencies, an approval that is reportedly difficult to obtain. Concerning Kessler’s strict regulations on BIS, a representative from the agency acknowledged that this was for the good of BIS to maintain its integrity. In addition, the representative stated that it is due to his strict regulations that he has managed to win Lutnick’s trust.

On this single day, these highly anticipated investment vehicles witnessed a combined net outflow of a staggering $812.27 million. This figure marks the highest daily net outflow observed over the past five months, sending ripples through the digital asset community. Understanding these significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile yet promising landscape of digital finance. US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Reach Record Highs: A Detailed Look The sheer scale of the US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1 caught many by surprise. According to data shared by Trader T on X, the total net outflow of $812.27 million represents a substantial movement of capital out of these funds. This event underscores the dynamic nature of institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated investment products. The outflows were not evenly distributed, with some funds experiencing far greater reductions in their holdings. This highlights varying investor behaviors and fund-specific dynamics within the broader market. Spot Bitcoin ETF Net Outflow (August 1) Fidelity (FBTC) $331.42 million ARK Invest (ARKB) $327.93 million Grayscale (GBTC) $66.79 million Bitwise (BITB) $38.27 million Grayscale Mini BTC $33.60 million Franklin Templeton (EZBC) $6.57 million Invesco (BTCO) $5.08 million BlackRock (IBIT) $2.61 million The table above details the significant outflows experienced by various U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 1. US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Staggering $812 Million Exodus Raises Concerning Questions Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB accounted for the majority of the outflows, signaling substantial position adjustments. While Grayscale’s GBTC also saw outflows, its proportional impact was less given its larger asset base. Several other ETFs, including Invesco’s BTCO and BlackRock’s IBIT, also reported net outflows, though on a smaller scale. Some ETFs reported no change in their holdings. Why Did US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Occur So Suddenly? The sudden surge in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows prompts an important question: what factors contributed to this significant capital movement? Market analysts and observers point to several potential reasons, often a combination of macro-economic shifts and specific cryptocurrency market dynamics. Profit-Taking: After periods of price appreciation, some investors may choose to realize profits. ETFs provide an easy mechanism for institutional and large-scale investors to do so. Broader Market Correction: The cryptocurrency market is subject to cycles of correction. A general downturn in investor sentiment or a specific crypto trigger could lead to reduced exposure. Macroeconomic Factors: Changes in interest rates, inflation data, or geopolitical events can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Rebalancing Strategies: Large institutional investors often rebalance their portfolios periodically to maintain a desired risk profile or align with new mandates. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fluid. New proposals or increased scrutiny could cause temporary pullbacks. A single day’s data, while significant, doesn’t always indicate a long-term trend. These outflows could be a one-off event driven by specific circumstances affecting a few large players, rather than a widespread loss of confidence. The Immediate Impact of US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows on the Market When significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows occur, the immediate impact on the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s price, can be noticeable. While direct causation is complex, a large outflow from these funds can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin in the underlying market. Here’s how these outflows can influence the market: Increased Selling Pressure: When investors redeem shares, the ETF provider typically sells a corresponding amount of Bitcoin to meet those redemptions. This adds to the supply, potentially driving down price. Shift in Market Sentiment: Large outflows can be interpreted as weakening institutional interest, leading to a decline in overall market sentiment and potentially triggering further selling. Liquidity Concerns: Very large, sudden outflows could test liquidity in certain trading pairs or at specific price levels. The market’s reaction is often a blend of direct selling impact and psychological impact from perceived trends. Traders and analysts closely monitor these flows as an indicator of institutional conviction. Navigating Volatility: Insights for Investors Amidst US Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows For investors, understanding the implications of events like significant US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows is key to making informed decisions. Market volatility is inherent in cryptocurrency, and reacting impulsively to daily fluctuations can harm long-term goals. Consider these insights when navigating market uncertainty: Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s price history shows cycles of rallies and corrections. Investors with a long-term horizon often view dips as opportunities. Diversification is Key: A diversified portfolio across different cryptocurrencies or traditional assets can help mitigate risk during downturns. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Rely on multiple, credible sources. Understand the difference between short-term market noise and fundamental shifts. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):: Investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price can help smooth out volatility. While large outflows can be concerning, they are a natural part of a maturing market where institutional participants actively manage positions. Such events test market resilience and often precede periods of re-accumulation. What Lies Ahead for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Despite the recent surge in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows , the long-term outlook for these investment vehicles remains positive. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. was a landmark event, signifying a new era of institutional acceptance and accessibility for Bitcoin. Looking forward, several factors will likely shape the trajectory of these ETFs: Continued Institutional Adoption: As more financial advisors and institutional platforms integrate these ETFs, their reach and asset under management (AUM) are expected to grow. Market Maturation: As the crypto market matures, volatility may decrease, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a broader range of investors. Regulatory Clarity: Further regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies globally could boost investor confidence and attract more capital into regulated products. While a single day of significant outflows is noteworthy, it does not erase the fundamental importance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in bridging traditional finance with the digital asset world. They represent a crucial step towards mainstream adoption, offering a regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. In conclusion, the $812.27 million in US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1 was a significant event, marking the highest daily net outflow in five months. Led primarily by Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB, these withdrawals highlight the dynamic nature of institutional investment in Bitcoin. While such movements can create short-term market pressure and shift sentiment, they are often attributable to factors like profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. For investors, maintaining a long-term perspective, diversifying portfolios, and conducting thorough research remain essential strategies for navigating the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The long-term trajectory for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to point towards their increasing role in mainstream finance, despite occasional periods of significant capital movement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the large US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows on August 1? The significant outflows on August 1 were likely caused by a combination of factors, including profit-taking by large investors after periods of Bitcoin price appreciation, portfolio rebalancing by institutional funds, and broader macroeconomic shifts influencing risk appetite. Which US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced the largest outflows? On August 1, Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB led with the largest net outflows, accounting for a substantial portion of the total $812.27 million. Grayscale’s GBTC also saw significant withdrawals. How do US spot Bitcoin ETF outflows affect Bitcoin’s price? Large outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to selling pressure on Bitcoin in the underlying market, as ETF providers sell Bitcoin to meet redemptions. This can lead to a short-term decrease in Bitcoin’s price and a shift in market sentiment. Are these outflows a sign of declining interest in Bitcoin ETFs? Not necessarily. While significant, these outflows could be part of normal market cycles, such as profit-taking or portfolio adjustments by large institutional players. They do not automatically indicate a long-term decline in interest. What should investors do in response to these significant outflows? Investors should avoid impulsive reactions. Instead, focus on a long-term investment strategy, consider diversifying portfolios, and conduct thorough research. Dollar-cost averaging can also be a useful strategy to mitigate volatility.

With meme coins outperforming legacy assets during key bull cycles, the spotlight now turns to the next batch of game-changers preparing to launch or surge. These aren’t just tokens; they are movements, meme-fueled communities, and sometimes cultural icons. Among this next wave of potential meme market leaders are MoonBull ($MOBU), Floki ($FLOKI), Brett ($BRETT), Popcat ($POPCAT), and Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT). Each project brings a unique twist to the meme economy, but MoonBull stands above all in terms of opportunity, urgency, and insider advantages. It’s the best upcoming crypto in 2025. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull is an Ethereum meme coin created specifically for traders who chase performance, rapid gains, and meme culture. Built with a strong emphasis on early-stage rewards, it delivers secret token drops and elite staking incentives accessible only to whitelist participants. Unlike typical meme coins, MoonBull blends smart contract reliability with exclusive DeFi mechanics. Security, transparency, and Ethereum-native compatibility make it not only accessible but deeply integrated into the larger DeFi system. Once the public presale opens, the advantage held by whitelist members will no longer be available. With major social buzz and development milestones already underway, MoonBull is positioning itself as the best upcoming crypto in 2025. The project has engineered scarcity and premium incentives to drive aggressive early demand. Once the presale opens, entry pricing will increase, and whitelist-only perks will disappear permanently. MoonBull makes this list because it combines virality with genuine utility and early-stage investor protection, all while maintaining the meme culture edge. How to Get Whitelisted for MoonBull ($MOBU): Step-by-Step Guide Gaining access to the MoonBull whitelist is the single most strategic move for anyone looking to get in on the best upcoming crypto in 2025.

Enter a valid email address in the secure whitelist form. Confirm your submission via the email verification link. Await a private notification that reveals the exact date and time for the Stage One launch. Be ready to participate as soon as the presale opens. Taking these steps ensures a front-row seat to MoonBull’s explosive entry into the market. With limited whitelist spots available, speed is critical – once filled, the chance is gone. 2. Floki ($FLOKI) Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, Floki ($FLOKI) evolved from a simple meme into a sprawling crypto ecosystem. The project now includes a metaverse game (Valhalla), an NFT marketplace, and education platforms. Floki’s development team has aggressively expanded use cases while maintaining the viral humor that originally drove its popularity. Floki’s ability to evolve while holding onto its meme identity is a rare balance. The coin has gained listings on major centralized exchanges and is increasingly accepted by global brands. Such developments add legitimacy and long-term value to its meme coin origins. Floki earns its place on the best crypto in 2025 list due to its multi-dimensional approach, real-world partnerships, and a community that has proven resilient through volatile cycles. 3. Brett ($BRETT) Brett is a meme coin born from the iconic character in Matt Furie’s universe, closely tied to Pepe lore. However, unlike many short-lived meme tokens, Brett delivers high community engagement, organized transparency from the dev team, and consistent development updates. Brett rose rapidly in recent months, signaling early interest from retail and meme coin enthusiasts alike. It has become a cultural favorite across Telegram and X, gathering a massive following without relying on traditional marketing. This grassroots momentum is key to sustaining long-term meme value. Brett secured its spot among the best cryptos in 2025 because of its cultural roots, growing liquidity, and organic viral reach. 4. Popcat ($POPCAT) Popcat started as an internet meme and rapidly evolved into one of the most-talked-about coins on Solana. What makes Popcat stand out is its gamified tokenomics, where holding and engaging with the community earn extra benefits. Popcat’s humor-driven branding hides a surprisingly robust architecture. Built on a fast and low-cost Solana framework, Popcat enjoys high-speed transaction capabilities and excellent scalability. The project has already been embraced by meme collectors and NFT enthusiasts, giving it a wide web3 footprint. Popcat is featured on the best crypto in 2025 list due to its perfect balance of playful engagement and cutting-edge blockchain design. 5. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) is among the newest meme coins, yet it’s already attracting attention for its quirky branding and meme-styled storytelling. This squirrel-themed token presents itself as the ultimate acorn-chasing crypto with well-executed humor and solid tokenomics. What sets PNUT apart is its surprise airdrop model and community-first token allocation. Designed to reward active participants early, PNUT mirrors many successful token launches that rewarded early believers with life-changing gains. Peanut the Squirrel rounds out this list as a top crypto pick in 2025, because of its innovative distribution strategy, meme appeal, and engaged early supporters.

On August 1, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a substantial combined net outflow of $152.26 million. This figure, as highlighted by data shared by Trader T on X, marks the third-highest single-day net outflow since these groundbreaking products were introduced to the market. Such a significant movement naturally captures the attention of investors and market analysts, prompting a closer examination of what exactly transpired and what these Ethereum ETF outflows could signify for the broader digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Specifics: Which Ethereum ETFs Saw Outflows? To fully grasp the scale of these Ethereum ETF outflows , it is essential to look at the individual products that contributed to this considerable sum. While the overall figure is impactful, understanding the distribution across various funds provides a clearer picture of investor behavior and market preferences. The data reveals that several prominent Ethereum ETFs faced significant redemptions on this particular day. ETF Name Net Outflow (Millions USD) Grayscale’s mini ETH $47.68 Bitwise’s ETHW $40.30 Grayscale’s ETHE $37.20 Invesco’s QETH $8.42 Fidelity’s FETH $6.17 Franklin Templeton’s EZET $5.37 VanEck’s ETHV $5.18 ARK 21Shares’ CETH $1.94 This table illustrates that Grayscale’s mini ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW led the redemptions, accounting for a significant portion of the total Ethereum ETF outflows . The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating that the outflows were concentrated among specific products. Why Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows Happening? Decoding the Market Signals. Understanding the catalysts behind such significant Ethereum ETF outflows is crucial for investors and market participants. Several factors could contribute to these movements, often reflecting broader market sentiment or individual investor strategies: Profit-Taking: After periods of positive price performance for Ethereum, some investors might opt to realize their gains. This is a common practice in any investment market, where assets are sold after reaching a desired profit margin, leading to redemptions from ETF holdings. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall mood in the cryptocurrency market plays a significant role. Concerns about macroeconomic conditions, shifts in global financial policies, or even a general downturn in risk appetite can lead investors to reduce their exposure to more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutional investors and even savvy individual investors regularly rebalance their portfolios to maintain specific asset allocations. These Ethereum ETF outflows could be a result of a strategic decision to adjust exposure to digital assets in favor of other asset classes, or vice versa, depending on their investment objectives. Regulatory Uncertainty: While spot Ethereum ETFs have been approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains in flux. Any perceived shift in regulatory stance or new commentary from authorities could trigger caution among investors, leading to a reduction in their holdings. Competition from Direct Holdings: Some investors might choose to hold Ethereum directly on exchanges or through other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, especially if they seek greater control, lower fees, or access to staking rewards not always available through ETFs. The Immediate Impact: How Do Ethereum ETF Outflows Affect the Market? When significant Ethereum ETF outflows occur, they can send ripples through the market. The most immediate effect is often a bearish signal, which can exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price in the short term. This is because fund managers, to meet redemption requests, may need to sell a portion of their underlying Ethereum holdings, thereby increasing selling pressure on the open market. Beyond price action, these outflows can also influence investor confidence. Sustained periods of redemptions might make new investors hesitant to enter the market through these ETF vehicles, perceiving a lack of momentum or underlying weakness. However, it is important to note that the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market is substantial. While $152.26 million is a considerable sum for a single day, the market’s ability to absorb such movements without a drastic price collapse speaks to its growing maturity and depth. Broader Context: Are These Ethereum ETF Outflows a Trend or an Anomaly? While the $152.26 million outflow is significant, ranking as the third-highest, it is essential to place these Ethereum ETF outflows within a broader historical context. Such movements are not entirely unprecedented in the world of exchange-traded funds, particularly in nascent asset classes like cryptocurrencies. For instance, Bitcoin ETFs have also experienced periods of substantial outflows, especially during broader market corrections or shifts in investor sentiment. These ebbs and flows are a natural part of capital movement in dynamic financial markets. The very nature of ETFs, designed for liquidity and ease of trading, means that capital can move in and out relatively quickly. Therefore, a single day’s outflow, while notable, does not necessarily dictate a long-term trend. Instead, it often reflects a snapshot of market sentiment and investor reactions to prevailing conditions. Understanding these patterns helps investors maintain perspective and avoid overreacting to short-term events, recognizing that market cycles involve both inflows and outflows. Navigating the Current Climate: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst Ethereum ETF Outflows. For investors currently holding or considering investments in spot Ethereum ETFs, these recent Ethereum ETF outflows offer several key considerations and actionable insights: Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets, including those influenced by ETFs, are known for their volatility. Focusing on the long-term potential of the Ethereum ecosystem and its technological advancements, rather than short-term price fluctuations, can be a more effective strategy. Prioritize Diversification: As with any investment, diversification remains a cornerstone of prudent portfolio management. Spreading investments across different asset classes and within the crypto space can help mitigate risks associated with the performance of a single asset or ETF. Implement Robust Risk Management: Investors should only invest capital they can comfortably afford to lose. Defining clear entry and exit strategies, setting stop-loss orders, and regularly reviewing one’s risk tolerance are crucial steps in managing exposure to volatile assets. Stay Informed and Conduct Due Diligence: The cryptocurrency market evolves rapidly. Staying abreast of regulatory news, broader market sentiment, and fundamental developments within the Ethereum network is vital. Informed decisions are always the best decisions. The Road Ahead: What Do These Ethereum ETF Outflows Mean for the Future of Digital Asset Investments? The recent Ethereum ETF outflows underscore the dynamic and maturing nature of the digital asset investment landscape. While significant, these movements are part of a broader process where cryptocurrencies are increasingly integrated into traditional financial products. The approval and launch of spot Ethereum ETFs themselves represented a major milestone, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for a wider audience to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. This institutional embrace is a long-term positive, even if it comes with the typical market behaviors seen in traditional finance, including periods of profit-taking and rebalancing. Looking forward, the long-term success of spot Ethereum ETFs will hinge on their ability to attract sustained inflows over time, proving their utility as mainstream investment vehicles. As the market continues to mature and regulatory clarity improves, these products could play an even larger role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. The journey of mainstream crypto adoption is still unfolding, and moments like these outflows provide valuable data points for its trajectory. Concluding Thoughts: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum ETFs The $152.26 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 1 serves as a crucial data point, highlighting a period of significant investor activity. While substantial, it is essential to view these Ethereum ETF outflows within the broader context of market cycles and evolving investor strategies. These events are not uncommon in nascent markets and can often provide valuable insights into market sentiment and liquidity dynamics. For the burgeoning world of digital asset investments, understanding these flows is key to navigating the path forward and appreciating the complex interplay of factors shaping the future of digital asset investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot Ethereum ETF? A: A spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that directly holds Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making it accessible to a broader range of investors. Q2: Why did U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experience significant outflows on August 1? A: The significant Ethereum ETF outflows on August 1 can be attributed to several factors, including profit-taking by investors after periods of price appreciation, broader negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, strategic portfolio rebalancing by large investors, or reactions to ongoing regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset space. Q3: How do these Ethereum ETF outflows impact the price of Ethereum? A: Large Ethereum ETF outflows can exert short-term downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. This is because ETF managers may need to sell a portion of their underlying ETH holdings to meet redemption requests, increasing the supply of ETH on the open market and potentially leading to a price decline. However, the overall impact depends on the market’s liquidity and demand. Q4: Is this a common occurrence for ETFs in general? A: Yes, outflows and inflows are a normal part of ETF operations, especially in volatile or new asset classes. ETFs are designed for liquidity, allowing investors to easily buy and sell shares. Periods of significant outflows can occur due to various market conditions, investor sentiment shifts, or rebalancing strategies, similar to traditional stock or bond ETFs. Q5: What should investors consider in response to these outflows? A: Investors should maintain a long-term perspective, focusing on Ethereum’s fundamental technology and ecosystem growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification across different assets, implementing sound risk management strategies, and staying informed about market trends and regulatory developments are also crucial considerations.

Over the past 24 hours, the world’s largest cryptocurrency recorded a dip to $114,326 before slightly recovering above the $115,000 mark. Despite this rebound, the asset remains under pressure, with recent market movements highlighting potential shifts in trader sentiment and long-term holder behavior. Data shared by market analysts indicates that derivatives activity is playing a significant role in current price fluctuations. Insights from the analytics platform CryptoQuant suggest that sudden changes in leveraged positions and aggressive selling pressure on major exchanges are contributing to the ongoing volatility. At the same time, on-chain data shows an increase in activity from long-term Bitcoin holders, suggesting a structural change in the market that may influence future price dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet Leveraged Positions Under Pressure on Major Exchanges According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin’s decline below $115,000 coincided with a notable reduction in open interest on Binance, dropping from $14 billion to under $13.5 billion in a short span. This 4% decline in open interest within a single day is often linked to liquidation events, where leveraged positions are closed automatically due to margin calls. Taha explained that many traders appear to have exited long positions as the price fell, potentially triggering a cascade of sell orders and amplifying market pressure. Net Taker Volume on Binance also turned sharply negative, nearing -$160 million, suggesting an increase in aggressive selling activity. This trend reflects fear-driven reactions among market participants, particularly retail traders, who may have chosen to close or reverse positions amid expectations of further price declines. Despite this wave of selling, Taha noted the possibility of a short-term rebound. A reduction in leveraged long positions combined with an increase in short exposure could create conditions for a market rebalancing or a short squeeze if selling pressure eases in the coming days. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Show Signs of Major Reallocation In addition to short-term derivatives market dynamics, other analysts are pointing to broader structural changes in Bitcoin’s investor base. CryptoQuant analyst OnChainSchool highlighted that in 2024, more than 255,000 BTC previously inactive for over seven years were reactivated. In 2025, this trend has continued, with over 215,000 BTC already moving within the first several months of the year. The average monthly movement of long-dormant coins has risen from 4,900 BTC in 2023 to over 30,000 BTC in 2025. Transaction sizes have also grown significantly, from around 162 BTC to over 1,000 BTC per transfer. According to OnChainSchool, these patterns indicate that large-scale holders, rather than retail investors, are reallocating capital on a scale not seen in previous cycles. The analyst suggested that beyond price fluctuations, these shifts may have long-term implications for market liquidity and Bitcoin’s future ownership distribution.

While Bitcoin dominance remains strong, traders are beginning to rotate into high – upside opportunities across meme coins, gaming tokens, and emerging infrastructure plays. Altcoins with strong narratives, growing communities, and upcoming catalysts are quickly gaining traction. Among the standout names, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured analyst attention with bold upside projections. Market experts forecast that a $4,500 position in MAGACOIN FINANCE could become $52,500 , based on current momentum and rapid presale growth. With a deflationary token model and viral appeal, it is positioned as one of the most compelling entries of Q3. Four other tokens—Wall Street Pepe, Haedal, Bitget Token, and SkyArk Chronicles – are drawing increased interest across social platforms and analyst circles. Each brings something unique to the table, whether it’s cultural relevance, staking utility, CEX backing, or gaming utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts Predict a 10x Upside Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE blends meme culture with a pro-freedom message that has gone viral across X and Telegram. Its presale has already passed multiple milestones, signaling strong early-stage demand. Analysts believe that the token’s appeal lies not only in its branding but also in its aggressive deflationary structure and reward – driven referral model. With market sentiment improving, MAGACOIN is viewed as one of the few meme coins with both high upside and lasting momentum. The forecast? A $4,500 allocation potentially reaching $52,500 if current buyer enthusiasm holds. Wall Street Pepe (WSPE): Meme Culture Meets Market Power Wall Street Pepe is culturally resonant meme tokens of the year. Mixing themes of financial rebellion, meme warfare, and old-school trading aesthetics, WSPE has drawn in thousands of holders and continues to trend on DEXTools. With ongoing community campaigns and token burns, it’s maintaining high engagement while preparing for potential Tier 1 exchange listings. For traders looking for a narrative-rich meme coin with staying power, WSPE is becoming possible option Haedal: Cross-Chain Staking With Real Yield Utility Haedal is a new staking-focused project that’s generating buzz for its ability to provide real yield across multiple blockchains. It offers a user-friendly dashboard for managing staking portfolios and earns rewards by integrating both on-chain validator infrastructure and off-chain partnerships. Analysts are watching Haedal closely as capital continues flowing into DeFi platforms with reliable APY potential and cross-chain accessibility. Its combination of usability and functionality makes it one of August’s most practical candidates. Bitget Token (BGB): CEX-Backed Momentum Builder Bitget Token, the native coin of the Bitget exchange, is experiencing renewed momentum as exchange volumes pick up. With Bitget expanding its ecosystem, launching new staking products, and incentivizing BGB holders, demand is surging both from traders and long-term holders. BGB has also held strong through recent volatility, making it a popular pick for those seeking a mid-cap token with real-world CEX utility and steady exchange support. SkyArk Chronicles (SAC): Gaming Meets NFT Economy SkyArk Chronicles is an emerging blockchain game that merges role-playing mechanics with NFT integration. Built by a team of Web2 and Web3 veterans, SAC offers immersive gameplay while enabling item ownership through its native token. As GameFi narratives begin to rebound, SkyArk’s ecosystem approach and active development pipeline give it an edge. With community quests and NFT drops scheduled for August, momentum is quickly building . Conclusion : August is shaping up as a crucial month for identifying breakout altcoins before the next market-wide move. From the meme-powered rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Wall Street Pepe to the staking innovation of Haedal, the exchange utility of Bitget Token, and the GameFi vision of SkyArk Chronicles, each token offers a distinct value proposition. MAGACOIN’s $4,500-to-$52,500 potential stands out, but all five are gaining analyst traction as capital shifts into higher-risk, higher-reward positions. With altcoin season heating up, early entry may prove decisive.

A coin sitting below the $1 mark might seem like small stakes, but in reality, it could hold much more promise than others trading at higher prices. The shift in the community’s mindset is clear now; today’s participants look beyond prices and focus more on practical developments and strong foundations. Names like BlockDAG, Cardano, TRON, and Stellar are proving that affordability doesn’t mean a lack of progress. These top crypto gems to buy under $1 are making real progress across different use cases. They’re not gaining attention just for their low prices but for the solid moves happening in the background. Let’s dive into why each one is gaining traction. 1. BlockDAG: Rising Presale Giant Already Raised $358M Excitement around BlockDAG (BDAG) is no longer based on speculation. The project is showing real action, backed by working apps, user engagement, and strong funding. At $0.0016 per coin, BlockDAG remains accessible but has shown momentum that can’t be ignored. The presale remains open until August 11th at this price. So far, BlockDAG has sold 24.6 billion coins and raised $358 million in total presale funding, reflecting strong user confidence. With a launch price of $0.05, early supporters have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660% since batch 1. That return is rare in today’s market and continues to attract attention. What’s more, BlockDAG has successfully hosted miner demo events globally, showing its X1 and X10 products in real use. It now boasts over 4,500 builders, daily competitions like Buyer Battles, and a 15% referral reward, all of which are helping increase participation. The growing activity suggests BlockDAG could climb toward $1, and with many speculating long-term targets between $5 and $10, the upside remains large. At its current price point, BDAG stands out as one of the top crypto gems to buy under $1. With limited time left in the presale and increasing demand, it’s attracting growing attention across the crypto space. 2. Cardano: Resilient Structure and Smart Contract Strength Cardano’s development strategy, built on academic research and proof-of-stake mechanisms, gives it a unique position. It’s energy-efficient and ideal for scaling decentralized applications. The focus has always been on sustainability, long-term development, and reliable upgrades. Since early July, Cardano’s price has surged over 50%, breaking through a 230-day resistance level. Analysts see an ascending triangle forming on its chart, often a bullish sign for future growth. With a previous all-time high of $3.10, even a partial return to that range could deliver 3x–4x growth. Among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, Cardano’s ongoing research-backed development and its use in real-world applications make it a solid long-term option for those watching fundamentals closely. 3. TRON: High Volume and Fast Payments Set It Apart Hovering around $0.33, TRON focuses on powering content platforms, games, and apps that need fast transactions. The platform processes over $2 trillion in stablecoin transactions each quarter, one of the highest volumes across any blockchain. It also handles more than 2,000 transactions every second, making it extremely efficient. TRON has just passed the $0.30 threshold, showing signs of bullish movement. Its solid activity levels, rising developer community, and wide adoption continue to support strong long-term possibilities. Market analysts suggest a jump toward $5–$7 could be realistic, with a full breakout to $15–$20 possible if global use spikes. Thanks to these strengths, TRON deserves its place among the top crypto gems to buy under $1, especially for those tracking usage metrics and developer traction. 4. Stellar: Evolving With Major Partnerships and Payment Tools Stellar sits close to $0.42 and focuses on simplifying payments across borders. By linking banks, businesses, and those without access to banking, Stellar builds payment solutions for developing economies. It has kept fees low and speeds fast, thanks to upgrades like Protocol 23. The project has partnered with top firms like IBM, PayPal, and MoneyGram, which increases its utility in financial services. These collaborations helped boost Stellar’s price by 30% in recent weeks, and there’s speculation of further gains ahead. With a push into the global payment space and improving features, Stellar holds strong potential to reach $5 to $10 over time, or even $20 with broader expansion. That momentum secures Stellar’s name among the top crypto gems to buy under $1. To Sum Up! Some of the most successful digital currencies began their journeys trading for pennies. BlockDAG has already seen 2,660% growth since its first presale batch and recently hosted successful miner product demos. With over 4,500 active builders, the excitement around BDAG is real and growing as it nears the final phase of its presale.

As co-founder of the prominent BitMEX crypto exchange, Hayes’s insights carry significant weight within the digital asset community. His recent pronouncements via X suggest that Bitcoin could be on a trajectory to test the monumental $100,000 mark, with Ethereum potentially reaching $3,000. But what exactly underpins this audacious forecast, and what does it mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive deep into the macroeconomic forces and strategic thinking that could propel these digital giants to new heights. What’s Driving Arthur Hayes’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Arthur Hayes’s outlook isn’t merely a speculative guess; it’s rooted in a nuanced analysis of global macroeconomic conditions, particularly focusing on the United States. His recent observations highlight that the full impact of U.S. tariff policies is expected to become significantly more apparent in the third quarter of the year. This assessment comes in the wake of critical U.S. nonfarm payroll data, which provides a snapshot of the nation’s economic health and labor market dynamics. Hayes underscores a critical point: “No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” This statement is central to his Bitcoin price prediction . In essence, he argues that the traditional economic engines of major economies are struggling to generate sufficient credit growth to stimulate nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). When traditional financial systems face such constraints, investors often seek alternative assets that are less correlated with conventional markets or that offer a hedge against potential inflation or economic stagnation. Key factors contributing to Hayes’s perspective include: U.S. Tariff Policies: These policies can disrupt global supply chains, influence trade balances, and impact inflation, potentially leading to a flight of capital into non-traditional assets. Nonfarm Payroll Data: While seemingly a labor market indicator, its implications extend to consumer spending, economic growth, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Weak or stagnant growth signals can prompt investors to look for store-of-value assets. Credit Creation Deficit: A lack of sufficient credit growth means less money flowing into productive economic activities, which can depress nominal GDP. This scenario often pushes capital into assets perceived as scarce or independent of traditional financial system vulnerabilities, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understanding the Macroeconomic Undercurrents Influencing Bitcoin Hayes’s analysis suggests a deeper interplay between global finance and the crypto market. The concept of “credit creation” is fundamental to how economies grow. When banks lend money, they create new credit, which fuels investment, consumption, and ultimately, nominal GDP. If this process slows down significantly across major economies, it implies a tightening of financial conditions or a lack of robust economic activity. In such an environment, assets that exist outside the traditional banking system, like cryptocurrencies, can become attractive. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is particularly appealing due to its decentralized nature, finite supply, and perceived resistance to inflationary pressures. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and burgeoning role in the Web3 space, also stands to benefit as capital seeks innovative and independent avenues. Consider the potential ripple effects: Economic Factor Impact on Traditional Markets Potential Effect on Crypto (BTC/ETH) Slow Credit Growth Reduced nominal GDP, potential stagnation Increased demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin Tariff Policy Impacts Supply chain disruption, inflation concerns Hedge against inflation, flight to digital gold Weak Nonfarm Payrolls Signals economic slowdown, lower consumer confidence Investors seek uncorrelated assets, pushing the Bitcoin price prediction higher Arthur Hayes’s Personal Market Moves: A Strategic Insight into Bitcoin’s Future? Interestingly, Hayes’s optimistic Bitcoin price prediction comes alongside some notable personal trading activity. Earlier, he offloaded significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) and Ethena (ENA). While this might seem counterintuitive to a bullish stance, it often reflects sophisticated portfolio management or tactical positioning rather than a loss of faith in the long-term potential of these assets. Details of his recent offloads: Asset Amount Offloaded Approximate USD Value Ethereum (ETH) 2,373 ETH $8.32 million Ethena (ENA) 7.76 million ENA $4.62 million Arthur Hayes’s strategic moves are often closely watched by the crypto community for insights into market trends and potential shifts in the Bitcoin price prediction. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why Arthur Hayes Sees a Stunning $100K Future Such moves could indicate several strategies: Profit Taking: Cashing out gains from recent rallies to secure profits. Rebalancing: Adjusting portfolio allocation to increase exposure to other assets, or to raise cash for future opportunities. Tax Planning: Strategic sales can sometimes be related to managing tax liabilities. Funding Other Ventures: Capital might be needed for investments in new projects or personal endeavors. It is important to differentiate between a short-term tactical trade and a long-term fundamental belief. Hayes’s continued public optimism regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum’s future suggests his recent sales are likely part of a broader, more sophisticated financial strategy, rather than a sign of diminishing conviction in his long-term Bitcoin price prediction . Is a $100K Bitcoin Target a Realistic Outlook? The idea of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is not new, but it consistently garners attention. Arthur Hayes’s specific macroeconomic rationale adds another layer of credibility to this often-discussed target. While such a surge would represent significant gains for investors, it’s crucial to consider the various factors that could influence this trajectory. Potential Benefits of a $100K Bitcoin: Increased Mainstream Adoption: Higher prices often bring more institutional and retail interest, further legitimizing crypto. Network Effect: A rising price can attract more developers, users, and capital into the ecosystem, strengthening its foundation. Wealth Creation: Significant returns for early investors and those who have held through market cycles. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: The path to $100K is unlikely to be smooth, with potential for sharp corrections. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto gains prominence, so does the attention from regulators, which can introduce new challenges. Global Economic Shocks: Unforeseen global events could alter the macroeconomic landscape Hayes describes. Competition: While Bitcoin is dominant, the broader crypto market is dynamic, with new innovations emerging. Many analysts and models, including stock-to-flow models and various quantitative analyses, have projected Bitcoin reaching or exceeding $100,000 in cycles past or in the near future. Hayes’s unique perspective, tying it to specific macroeconomic indicators like credit creation and tariff impacts, offers a fresh lens through which to view this ambitious Bitcoin price prediction . It emphasizes that traditional financial pressures can paradoxically fuel growth in decentralized assets. Arthur Hayes’s compelling Bitcoin price prediction for $100,000, and Ethereum for $3,000, provides a fascinating look into how macroeconomic shifts could drive the next major crypto bull run. His insights into U.S. tariff policies and the global credit crunch offer a robust framework for understanding why he believes digital assets are poised for significant appreciation. While his personal trading activities might appear contradictory at first glance, they likely represent strategic maneuvers within a larger, bullish long-term vision. As the third quarter unfolds and economic data continues to emerge, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if Hayes’s bold forecast becomes a reality, cementing Bitcoin’s role as a formidable asset in an evolving global economy. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Price Prediction Q1: Who is Arthur Hayes? A1: Arthur Hayes is the co-founder of BitMEX, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. He is well-known for his insightful macroeconomic analyses and bold predictions within the crypto space. Q2: What is Arthur Hayes’s latest Bitcoin price prediction? A2: Arthur Hayes expects Bitcoin (BTC) to test the $100,000 level and Ethereum (ETH) to test the $3,000 level. This is his latest Bitcoin price prediction . Q3: What factors influence Arthur Hayes’s Bitcoin price prediction? A3: Hayes’s prediction is primarily influenced by the anticipated impact of U.S. tariff policies becoming more apparent in Q3, and his observation that “no major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp.” These macroeconomic conditions suggest a shift of capital towards decentralized assets. Q4: Why did Arthur Hayes offload ETH and ENA if he’s bullish on crypto? A4: Personal trading activities like offloading assets often reflect sophisticated portfolio management strategies, such as profit-taking, rebalancing, or funding other ventures, rather than a change in long-term conviction. It is common for traders to take profits even if they remain bullish on the overall market direction and their Bitcoin price prediction . Q5: How do U.S. tariff policies affect Bitcoin’s price? A5: U.S. tariff policies can disrupt global trade, potentially leading to inflation or economic uncertainty. In such scenarios, investors may seek safe-haven assets or inflation hedges, and Bitcoin is often seen as a digital alternative to traditional stores of value, which can drive its price up. Q6: What is “credit creation” and why is it important for the economy? A6: Credit creation refers to the process by which banks lend money, effectively creating new money in the economy. This credit fuels investment, consumption, and economic growth (nominal GDP). A slowdown in credit creation can indicate economic stagnation, making alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing.

The proposal follows a similar call last month by Aave co-founder Marc Zeller to halt the deployment of the Aave protocol on the Bitcoin Layer 2 network BOB. “L2s consume the time of talented developers. Each of these chains requires as much care as Ethereum, but the returns are minimal. By cutting development in this area, Curve can focus on more productive aspects,” phil_00Llama said in a post on the CurveDAO forum yesterday. For years, Ethereum has adopted a “rollup-centric roadmap” strategy, aiming to increase scalability through Layer 2 solutions. However, this approach is now being questioned by some. Some advocate for a renewed focus on Ethereum's core layer (Layer 1). Related News: Nasdaq-listed Company Announces Major Bitcoin and Solana Purchase Curve Finance is active on approximately 25 chains, including Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and many more. However, according to DeFiLlama data, the platform's total locked value (TVL) is almost entirely on the Ethereum mainnet: approximately $2.3 billion. Layer 2 platforms Arbitrum and Base only hold around $50 million in TVL. phil_00Llama justifies this by saying, “Curve’s pools on the Ethereum mainnet generate 450 times more revenue than all L2s combined, even on the slowest day.” He also argues that the focus should be on expanding Curve’s stablecoin solution, scrvUSD, on Ethereum. A CurveDAO member noted that L2 deployments only generate around $1,500 per day in revenue, making it an inefficient strategy given the high maintenance costs and short-lived network structures. He argued that developers should focus on “more meaningful work” instead. *This is not investment advice.

When we talk about significant moves in this space, especially concerning institutional adoption, the spotlight often turns to ARK Invest crypto strategies. The firm, under the leadership of Cathie Wood, has consistently demonstrated a willingness to invest in areas they believe will shape the future, and cryptocurrency is undoubtedly one such frontier. Recently, ARK Invest made headlines again with another substantial acquisition in the digital asset sector. On August 1st, the firm purchased an additional $29.79 million in Coinbase shares and $17.129 million in Bitmain shares. This latest move, reported by Ark Invest Daily on X, underscores ARK’s unwavering confidence in the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It’s a powerful signal that despite market fluctuations, ARK Invest sees fundamental value and growth opportunities within this nascent industry. What’s Behind ARK Invest Crypto’s Latest Strategic Moves? ARK Invest’s investment philosophy centers on identifying and capitalizing on disruptive innovation. Their latest acquisitions in Coinbase (COIN) and Bitmain, though a private entity and accessed likely through specific funds or derivatives given its private status, align perfectly with this core belief. These aren’t just speculative bets; they represent a strategic positioning within key pillars of the crypto economy. Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform in the United States, providing a gateway for millions of users to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Investing in Coinbase offers exposure to the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies, transaction volumes, and the overall growth of the crypto user base. It’s a direct play on the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. Bitmain, on the other hand, is a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining industry, particularly known for its ASIC miners. An investment in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, provides a stake in the foundational infrastructure of various proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. It’s about investing in the hardware that secures and enables these decentralized networks. This dual approach provides diversified exposure to the ARK Invest crypto thesis. To better visualize the scale of these recent acquisitions, consider the breakdown: Company Investment Amount (USD) Role in Crypto Ecosystem Coinbase (COIN) $29.79 Million Leading Crypto Exchange, Custody Services Bitmain $17.129 Million Dominant Crypto Mining Hardware Manufacturer Why is Coinbase a Core Component of ARK Invest Crypto Holdings? Coinbase represents a significant piece of the puzzle for ARK Invest crypto strategy due to several compelling factors. Firstly, as one of the most recognized and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, Coinbase offers a crucial on-ramp for both retail and institutional investors. Its compliance efforts and public listing provide a level of transparency and legitimacy that many other crypto ventures lack, aligning with ARK’s focus on investable innovation. Secondly, Coinbase benefits directly from the network effect of increasing crypto adoption. As more individuals and institutions enter the crypto space, Coinbase’s trading volumes, custody services, and subscription revenues are likely to grow. This positions it as a beneficiary of the overall expansion of the digital asset economy, regardless of which specific cryptocurrencies gain prominence. Furthermore, Coinbase is actively expanding its offerings beyond simple trading, venturing into areas like staking services, institutional custody, and a burgeoning developer ecosystem. This diversification provides multiple avenues for revenue growth and strengthens its position as a foundational player. For ARK Invest, owning Coinbase shares is a strategic bet on the infrastructure of the future digital financial system. How Does Bitmain Complement the ARK Invest Crypto Vision? While Coinbase focuses on the user-facing side of crypto, Bitmain delves into the very foundation of certain digital assets. Bitmain is a powerhouse in the design and manufacturing of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) used for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes it a critical player in the security and operation of these decentralized networks. Investing in Bitmain, or entities with exposure to its operations, allows ARK Invest to gain exposure to the underlying hardware layer of the crypto industry. This provides a different, yet equally vital, exposure compared to an exchange. It’s a play on the ongoing need for computational power to validate transactions and secure blockchain networks. As Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies continue to operate, the demand for efficient mining hardware persists. This strategic move highlights ARK’s comprehensive view of the crypto market, acknowledging that both the front-end user experience (Coinbase) and the back-end infrastructure (Bitmain) are essential for the long-term viability and growth of the digital asset ecosystem. It demonstrates a holistic understanding of how the ARK Invest crypto portfolio can gain exposure to various critical aspects of the industry. What Are the Broader Implications of ARK Invest Crypto Investments? These consistent investments by ARK Invest, particularly in high-profile companies like Coinbase and key infrastructure providers like Bitmain, send a powerful message to the broader financial market. They signify increasing institutional confidence in the legitimacy and staying power of digital assets. When a firm with the reputation and research capabilities of ARK Invest makes such moves, it often encourages other institutional players to take a closer look. Validation of the Asset Class: ARK’s continued buying reinforces the idea that cryptocurrencies are not just a fleeting trend but a legitimate and evolving asset class with long-term potential. Diversification Strategy: For ARK’s various ETFs, these investments provide diversified exposure to the crypto market beyond simply holding Bitcoin or Ethereum directly. They offer a way to participate in the growth of the infrastructure and service providers. Market Sentiment Influence: Cathie Wood’s pronouncements and ARK’s investment decisions often move markets. Their acquisitions can generate positive sentiment and draw attention to the underlying companies and the crypto sector as a whole. Focus on Innovation: The acquisitions underscore ARK’s commitment to investing in disruptive technologies. They view blockchain and digital assets as fundamental innovations that will reshape various industries. The consistent pattern of these acquisitions by ARK Invest crypto funds suggests a deeply held conviction in the transformative power of decentralized technologies and digital currencies. It’s a long-term vision that looks beyond daily price fluctuations to the fundamental shifts occurring in finance and technology. What Challenges Might ARK Invest Crypto Holdings Face? While ARK Invest’s bullish stance on crypto is clear, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with investing in this volatile sector. No investment is without its hurdles, and digital assets present a unique set: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and by extension, companies whose revenues are tied to them, can experience significant and rapid fluctuations. This volatility can impact the short-to-medium term performance of ARK’s holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains largely undefined in many jurisdictions, including the United States. Changes in regulations could significantly impact companies like Coinbase, affecting their operations, compliance costs, and business models. Competition: The crypto space is highly competitive, with new exchanges, mining operations, and blockchain technologies emerging constantly. This competition could erode market share or profitability for existing players. Technological Risks: While blockchain technology is robust, it’s still evolving. Risks such as security breaches, protocol vulnerabilities, or unexpected technological shifts could impact the entire ecosystem. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate changes, and global liquidity can also influence investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially affecting the performance of ARK Invest crypto assets. ARK Invest is known for its long-term investment horizon, often looking beyond short-term market noise. However, these challenges remain important considerations for any investor evaluating the digital asset space. Conclusion: ARK Invest’s Enduring Vision for Digital Assets ARK Invest’s continued accumulation of shares in companies like Coinbase and Bitmain is more than just a series of transactions; it’s a reaffirmation of their profound conviction in the future of digital assets. Cathie Wood and her team are not simply reacting to market trends; they are actively positioning their portfolios to benefit from what they believe will be one of the most significant technological and financial transformations of our era. Their strategic focus on both the user-facing platforms and the underlying infrastructure demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the crypto ecosystem’s growth drivers. These moves underscore a belief that despite the inherent volatility and regulatory headwinds, the long-term trajectory for digital assets is upward. For investors watching the space, ARK Invest’s consistent commitment to ARK Invest crypto investments serves as a powerful indicator of institutional confidence and a potential roadmap for how established finance views the evolving digital frontier. It’s a compelling narrative of innovation meeting investment, shaping the financial landscape for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ARK Invest?

For Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures, one of the most revealing indicators is the BTC long-short ratio . This metric offers a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate a price increase (long) or a decrease (short). It is not just a number; it is a pulse check of the market’s collective conviction, a tool that can empower traders to make more informed decisions. By analyzing these ratios, we can gain valuable insights into potential market movements and identify shifts in investor psychology. What Exactly Is the BTC Long-Short Ratio? The BTC long-short ratio is a simple yet powerful indicator that reflects the proportion of long positions versus short positions on a given cryptocurrency exchange for Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative product that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. Long Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will increase. They profit if the price goes up. Short Positions: These are opened by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will decrease. They profit if the price goes down. The Ratio Calculation: The ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number or volume of long positions by the total number or volume of short positions. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 indicates more short positions, suggesting bearish sentiment. Our data presents it as percentages for easier understanding. This ratio provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among leveraged traders. When a significant majority of traders are leaning one way, it can sometimes signal an impending reversal, as extreme positioning often precedes a shift in market direction. Decoding the Daily BTC Long-Short Ratio Landscape Let us examine the recent 24-hour BTC long-short ratio data for Bitcoin perpetual futures across several prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. This data offers immediate insight into current market positioning: Metric Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Across Exchanges 48.22% 51.78% Binance 48.05% 51.95% Bybit 47.12% 52.88% Gate.io 49.96% 50.04% As observed from the table, the aggregated data indicates a slight dominance of short positions, with 51.78% of traders leaning bearish compared to 48.22% leaning bullish. This suggests a cautious or slightly negative sentiment among futures traders over the past 24 hours. Individual exchange data largely mirrors this trend, with Bybit showing the strongest bearish bias and Gate.io exhibiting a near-even split, indicating diverse sentiment across platforms. This collective positioning is a key aspect of understanding the current market mood regarding the BTC long-short ratio . Why Do These BTC Long-Short Ratios Matter for Your Trading Strategy? Understanding the BTC long-short ratio is not just an academic exercise; it provides practical utility for your trading strategy. This metric offers several benefits for traders looking to gain an edge in the volatile crypto market: Sentiment Gauge: The most direct application is as a sentiment indicator. A high percentage of long positions suggests optimism, while a high percentage of short positions indicates pessimism. This can help confirm or contradict your own market bias. Contrarian Signals: Extreme imbalances in the ratio can sometimes act as contrarian signals. For instance, if the ratio shows an overwhelming number of long positions, it might suggest that the market is overextended, and a correction or reversal could be imminent. Similarly, an excessive number of short positions might indicate a potential short squeeze or bounce. Liquidation Risk Assessment: When one side of the market is heavily leveraged, it creates a pool of potential liquidations. If the price moves against the majority, these liquidations can trigger cascading effects, leading to rapid price swings. Monitoring the BTC long-short ratio can help anticipate such volatility. Confirmation Tool: The ratio can be used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and on-chain data to confirm trading signals. For example, if a chart pattern suggests a bullish breakout, and the long-short ratio is also increasing, it could provide stronger conviction for a long trade. Challenges and Nuances in Interpreting BTC Long-Short Ratios While the BTC long-short ratio is a valuable tool, it is not without its complexities and limitations. A nuanced understanding is crucial to avoid misinterpretations: Data Aggregation Issues: The data often comes from various exchanges, and not all platforms provide transparent or real-time ratio information. Aggregated data, while useful, might not capture the full picture of the entire market. Context is Paramount: The ratio should never be used in isolation. It must be analyzed alongside other key metrics such as funding rates, open interest, price action, and broader macroeconomic factors. A high long ratio during a strong uptrend might be healthy, whereas the same ratio during a consolidation phase could signal a top. Whale Influence: Large institutional traders or ‘whales’ can significantly skew the ratio with their substantial positions. Their motives might differ from retail traders, and their positioning could be part of a larger strategy not immediately apparent from the ratio alone. Short-Term Focus: The 24-hour BTC long-short ratio primarily reflects short-term sentiment. While useful for day traders, it might not provide significant insights for long-term investors. Longer timeframes or aggregated historical data might be needed for broader trend analysis. Lagging vs. Leading Indicator: In some scenarios, the ratio can be a lagging indicator, reflecting what has already happened. In others, particularly at extremes, it can be a leading indicator of potential reversals. Discerning this requires experience and careful observation. Actionable Insights: Leveraging BTC Long-Short Ratios in Your Trading Now that we have explored what the BTC long-short ratio is and its nuances, let us discuss how to practically apply this knowledge to enhance your trading decisions: Identify Extreme Ratios: Pay close attention when the ratio deviates significantly from its historical average or approaches extreme levels (e.g., 70%+ long or 70%+ short). These extremes often precede significant price movements or reversals. For instance, if the ratio is overwhelmingly long, consider if the market is due for a pullback as ‘fuel’ for short liquidations builds. Combine with Funding Rates: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts are fees paid between long and short positions to keep the contract price close to the spot price. A high positive funding rate combined with a high long-short ratio can indicate an overheated market, making long positions riskier. Conversely, negative funding rates with a high short ratio might suggest a potential short squeeze. Observe Divergences: Look for divergences between the ratio and price action. If Bitcoin’s price is making higher highs, but the BTC long-short ratio is showing a decreasing number of long positions, it could signal weakening bullish momentum or a lack of conviction from new buyers. Risk Management: Use the ratio to inform your risk management. If the market is heavily skewed in one direction, consider reducing your leverage or taking partial profits if you are on the side of the majority. If you are taking a contrarian position, ensure you have tight stop-losses. Track Across Exchanges: While the aggregate ratio is helpful, observe individual exchange ratios as well. Significant differences might indicate localized liquidity or specific trading dynamics on certain platforms. By integrating these actionable insights, traders can move beyond simply observing the BTC long-short ratio to actively using it as a component of a robust trading strategy. The Future of Market Sentiment: What’s Next for BTC Long-Short Ratios? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and so too are the tools and metrics traders use to navigate it. The BTC long-short ratio will continue to be a vital indicator for gauging short-term sentiment and potential market turning points. As the market matures and more sophisticated trading strategies emerge, the interpretation of these ratios may also evolve. The rise of institutional participation, advancements in algorithmic trading, and increasing regulatory clarity could all influence how these ratios behave and what signals they convey. Therefore, continuous learning and adaptation are essential for any trader relying on this metric. Staying informed about broader market trends and technological developments will enhance your ability to effectively utilize the BTC long-short ratio for future trading success. Conclusion The BTC long-short ratio provides a powerful lens through which to view the immediate sentiment of Bitcoin perpetual futures traders. While the recent 24-hour data suggests a slight bearish bias across major exchanges, it is crucial to remember that this metric is most effective when interpreted within a broader context. By understanding its calculation, recognizing its benefits as a sentiment and contrarian indicator, and acknowledging its limitations, traders can integrate this valuable tool into their analytical framework. Employing actionable insights such as identifying extremes, combining with funding rates, and practicing diligent risk management will enable you to leverage the BTC long-short ratio to navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater confidence and precision. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin perpetual future? A Bitcoin perpetual future is a derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. It is designed to track the underlying Bitcoin price closely through a funding rate mechanism. How does the BTC long-short ratio reflect market sentiment? The BTC long-short ratio reflects market sentiment by showing the proportion of traders betting on a price increase (long) versus those betting on a price decrease (short). A higher percentage of long positions indicates bullish sentiment, while a higher percentage of short positions indicates bearish sentiment. Can the BTC long-short ratio predict price movements? While the BTC long-short ratio is a strong indicator of sentiment and can sometimes precede price movements, especially at extreme levels, it is not a standalone predictor. It should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools for more accurate predictions. Why do different exchanges show slightly different BTC long-short ratios? Differences in ratios across exchanges can be due to varying user bases, trading strategies prevalent on each platform, and the specific algorithms or methodologies they use to calculate and present the ratio data. Each exchange has its own unique liquidity and trader demographics. Is a high short ratio always a bad sign for Bitcoin’s price? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio indicates prevailing bearish sentiment, extreme short positioning can sometimes lead to a ‘short squeeze.’ This occurs when the price unexpectedly rises, forcing short sellers to buy back their positions to cover losses, which further fuels the price increase. How often should I check the BTC long-short ratio? The frequency depends on your trading style. For day traders, checking the ratio hourly or every few hours might be beneficial. For swing traders, daily or even weekly checks might suffice to understand broader sentiment shifts.

The mission? Becoming the first token in the world that everybody holds, no matter their background, wealth, or level of crypto knowledge. What began as a bold experiment in fair tokenomics has evolved into a movement backed by data, unwavering community support, and unmatched staying power. HOLD sets out to be the Bitcoin on Ethereum, acting as a primary store of value with no one wallet owning more than 0.58% of the supply. Built Different from Day One At launch, HOLD introduced a revolutionary mechanism that took the entire market by surprise: no one could buy more than a tiny sliver of the supply. The buy limit increased slowly, eliminating early bot abuse and whale dominance. This approach inspired countless imitators, but none could match HOLD’s balance of fairness and organic growth. Then, the developer took it a step further—first buying 72.22% of the total supply with his own funds, and then burning it (see Etherscan ). The result: no central supply, no major dumps, and no future dilution. What remains is pure scarcity, controlled entirely by the retail investors. Backed by the Community, Not VC Money HOLD is a community takeover (CTO) project with no developer wallet or team wallet. The project is entirely community owned. From crypto veterans like Paddy (known for early calls on SHIB and Telcoin) and WIZZ , to community members grinding in X Spaces and IRL sticker warriors all over the world, $HOLD is powered by real people—not insiders or VCs. That means no VC wallets, no airdrops, and no token unlocks. HOLD’s grassroots movement continues to grow, with nearly 2,000 new holders in the last 90 days alone. Impeccable strength and tenure Having survived 660 days in the crypto trenches proves the strength of HOLD and its community. In this time, HOLD has survived three 80%+ pullbacks. This is significant and stands as a milestone in the crypto community, and the holder base has changed from early adopters to diehard believers. HOLD has achieved what many projects only dream of, and is primed for its next stage as we head into the strongest crypto bull market the world has ever seen, with a chart that calls to mind similar projects like SPX, SHIB, and DOGE, only with much greater upside potential. Soon Everybody Will Hold The mission of HOLD is simple but powerful: Everybody Will Hold. Everybody in crypto, then eventually everybody on Earth. Already, the community is spreading the word in over 40 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. With its unrivaled distribution and supply dynamics, HOLD has become a universal symbol of fairness, community, and shared opportunity in crypto. Now Live on Base With a new deployment on the Base chain, HOLD begins its next chapter. Faster and less expensive transactions bring accessibility to a new wave of holders, without compromising the original mission. Both smart contracts are now live: ETH Contract: 0x68b36248477277865c64dfc78884ef80577078f3 BASE Contract: 0x9493c825f691f272ce12b0d001b746130629bf71 HOLD Stats (July 2025) Price: $0.0093 Market Cap: $25.7M Holders: 4490 Circ.

Analysts expect clear definitions and guidelines may unlock institutional and retail flows previously held back. In this landscape, investors are watching for projects that can merge momentum with structural credibility. One such emerging token increasingly mentioned in this circle—and appearing on trusted ledger lists – is MAGACOIN FINANCE, now riding peak visibility amid security validation and audit-backed trust. Why September may mark a structural shift in crypto trust Media reports and industry commentary suggest the SEC’s policy change is more than technical – it’s symbolic . By shifting toward supportive frameworks around token classifications, staking, and digital-ledger security, the agency may offer renewed confidence to institutions now positioning for regulatory clarity. As insiders pivot capital in anticipation, timing and trust credentials become critical entry points. High on credibility and trust metrics Unlike many early-stage altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has earned a perfect 10/10 TrustScore from independent auditors – based on transparent tokenomics, fixed supply, verified smart contracts. Complementing this, the project has passed a full smart contract audit, with no critical vulnerabilities identified and structural integrity confirmed. Analysts consistently highlight its governance and public verification as rare strengths in the meme-token space. As regulations evolve, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a model case of early-stage altcoins built on structural transparency and audit-backed security. How these dynamics shape tactical investor decisions Historically, crypto cycles reward those who enter when both regulatory clarity and project legitimacy are aligning—before mainstream entry floods in. If September does usher in crypto-friendly policy, projects with public trust credentials and early technical validation are likely to outperform . Tokens that combine visible demand, audit transparency, and time-sensitive access often become the breakout candidates. MAGACOIN FINANCE now fits that profile—with its latest audit bolstering investor confidence in this critical phase. Conclusion: Timing, trust, and transparency converge Crypto insiders are eyeing the SEC’s reforms as a potential watershed moment – one that may change the playing field for early – stage assets . MAGACOIN FINANCE, fortified by independent audit ratings and TrustScore excellence, stands out as a token aligning momentum with legitimacy. Whether regulators deliver or not, the message is clear: when structural trust , audit credentials, and early visibility coincide, the long – term opportunity often follows. Investors positioning now may be able to capitalize before broader institutional adoption shifts the landscape.

This has prompted project proponents and analysts to ask who is selling at such adverse times for the underlying asset’s price. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko It’s safe to say that the past few days have been quite painful for the entire cryptocurrency industry, with more than $250 billion evaporating from the total market cap. Bitcoin’s price tumbled to multi-week lows of under $113,000, while many altcoins have crashed by 5-10%. However, Pi Network’s native token has taken this correction even worse. Pi has slumped by 16% in the past day alone, and more than 30% monthly. As a result, it plunged to a new all-time low today at $0.34 (on CoinGecko), which broke the previous anti-record from yesterday. On some exchanges, the price slump was even more profound, prompting analysts like Moon Jeff to ask who is selling at such low levels. $PI broke below its previous low at 40 cents. Now at 0.32.

Data from PiScan shows that there could be some relief in the near future. The token unlocks are set to be reduced in the next month, as only two days will see more than 7.5 million coins released. The average for the next month will be at 5.3 million, which is a lot fewer than the 7+ million in June and July.

It’s the engine that powers the entire Bitcoin network, creating new coins and validating transactions. Recently, a significant player in this space, Bitdeer, shared some exciting news that highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset accumulation. This development offers a fascinating glimpse into the operations of large-scale miners and their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. Bitdeer, a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) cloud mining company, recently announced via X that it successfully mined a total of 63.1 BTC over the past week. This achievement not only demonstrates their operational efficiency but also provides valuable insight into their strategic asset management. The firm also sold 26.8 BTC during the same period, indicating a thoughtful approach to balancing liquidity with long-term holdings. Consequently, Bitdeer’s pure holdings have increased by 36.4 BTC, bringing their total to an impressive 1,637.8 BTC. This growth underscores the ongoing profitability and strategic importance of professional Bitcoin mining operations. What is Bitcoin Mining and How Does Bitdeer Excel? For those new to the crypto world, you might be wondering: what exactly is Bitcoin mining ? At its core, it is the process by which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation, and new transactions are added to the blockchain. This process involves powerful computers solving complex computational puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees. It’s a critical function that ensures the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Bitdeer operates primarily as a cloud mining service. What does this mean? Instead of individuals buying and maintaining expensive mining hardware, they can purchase ‘hash rate’ from companies like Bitdeer. This allows them to participate in Bitcoin mining without the complexities of managing equipment, electricity costs, or cooling systems. Bitdeer leverages its vast infrastructure, advanced mining rigs, and optimized energy solutions to perform mining operations on a large scale. Their expertise in managing these complex systems allows them to achieve consistent mining outputs, as evidenced by their recent 63.1 BTC weekly haul. This model democratizes access to mining while centralizing the operational heavy lifting. Bitdeer’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: A Deep Dive into Growth Bitdeer’s recent report isn’t just about the quantity of Bitcoin mined; it also reveals a strategic approach to managing their digital assets. Mining 63.1 BTC in a week is a significant feat, but their decision to sell 26.8 BTC alongside this achievement provides a clearer picture of their operational strategy. This balancing act of accumulating new assets while liquidating a portion can be crucial for covering operational expenses, reinvesting in infrastructure, or managing market exposure. It reflects a sophisticated financial management strategy typical of large-scale crypto enterprises. The net increase of 36.4 BTC to their pure holdings, bringing the total to 1,637.8 BTC, demonstrates a clear long-term accumulation strategy. This indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and a commitment to growing their digital asset reserves. Understanding these movements is key to appreciating the financial health and strategic direction of a major Bitcoin mining entity. Let’s look at a simplified breakdown of their recent activity: Activity Amount (BTC) Impact on Holdings BTC Mined This Week 63.1 Increase BTC Sold This Week 26.8 Decrease Net Increase in Holdings 36.4 Positive Current Total Holdings 1,637.8 Accumulated This table illustrates the company’s dynamic management of its mined assets, highlighting a strategy that balances immediate needs with long-term accumulation. Such transparency from a major player like Bitdeer offers valuable data points for market analysts and investors. The Broader Impact of Robust Bitcoin Mining Operations The consistent success of large-scale Bitcoin mining operations like Bitdeer has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Firstly, it contributes to the overall security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. The more miners there are, and the more robust their operations, the more secure the network becomes against potential attacks. Secondly, their operational scale influences the market dynamics. While mining introduces new supply, the strategic holding patterns of major miners can also impact market sentiment and available supply for trading. Furthermore, the growth of companies like Bitdeer drives innovation in the mining sector. This includes advancements in energy efficiency, the development of more powerful mining hardware, and the exploration of sustainable energy sources for mining. As the industry matures, the focus on environmental impact becomes more pronounced, pushing miners towards greener solutions. Bitdeer, like many other large players, is increasingly investing in renewable energy projects to power their operations, aligning with global sustainability goals. This shift is vital for the long-term viability and public perception of Bitcoin mining . The profitability of Bitcoin mining is also closely tied to the price of Bitcoin itself, as well as the network’s difficulty adjustment and the block reward halving events. With the recent halving, the block reward for miners was cut in half, making operational efficiency and strategic asset management even more critical for profitability. Companies like Bitdeer, with their established infrastructure and strong financial position, are better equipped to navigate these changes compared to smaller, less capitalized operations. Their ability to continue mining and accumulating BTC post-halving speaks volumes about their resilience and long-term vision. Challenges and Opportunities in the Bitcoin Mining Landscape While the recent figures from Bitdeer paint a positive picture, the Bitcoin mining industry is not without its challenges. Volatility in Bitcoin’s price directly impacts revenue. Energy costs, regulatory changes, and increasing network difficulty are constant factors that miners must navigate. The competition is fierce, and staying ahead requires continuous investment in technology and infrastructure. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities. The drive for greater energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources are pushing the industry towards a more sustainable future. Innovation in mining hardware continues to improve profitability and reduce operational footprints. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these dynamics is key. The strength of mining operations like Bitdeer can be seen as a barometer for the health and confidence within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Their continued accumulation of BTC signals a strong belief in the asset’s long-term value, providing a layer of stability and institutional backing to the market. The transparency provided by companies like Bitdeer, sharing their mining output and holdings, helps build trust and provides valuable data for market analysis. Conclusion Bitdeer’s recent announcement of mining 63.1 BTC and increasing its pure holdings to over 1,637 BTC highlights the robust and evolving nature of the Bitcoin mining industry. It showcases not only the company’s operational strength but also its strategic approach to asset management in a dynamic market. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the role of large-scale miners like Bitdeer becomes increasingly important in securing the network, driving innovation, and shaping the supply-side economics of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Their ongoing success is a testament to the enduring power and potential of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is cloud mining, and how does Bitdeer fit into it? Cloud mining allows individuals to participate in Bitcoin mining by renting computing power (hash rate) from a mining farm like Bitdeer, rather than owning and operating their own hardware. Bitdeer provides the infrastructure and expertise for large-scale mining operations. Q2: Why did Bitdeer sell some of the Bitcoin they mined? Selling a portion of mined Bitcoin is a common strategic move for mining companies. It helps cover operational costs, invest in new equipment, manage liquidity, and potentially capitalize on favorable market prices while still accumulating a net increase in their holdings. Q3: How does Bitcoin mining impact the Bitcoin network? Bitcoin mining is crucial for the network’s security and functionality. Miners validate transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new bitcoins. This process maintains the integrity and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Q4: What are the main challenges for Bitcoin mining companies today? Key challenges include the volatile price of Bitcoin, rising energy costs, increasing network difficulty (making mining harder), and evolving regulatory landscapes. The recent Bitcoin halving also significantly reduced block rewards, increasing pressure on profitability. Q5: How does Bitdeer’s accumulation of BTC affect the market? When large entities like Bitdeer accumulate significant amounts of BTC, it can signal long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Their strategic holding patterns can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially influencing market dynamics and sentiment. Q6: Is Bitcoin mining becoming more environmentally friendly? Yes, there is a growing trend towards more sustainable Bitcoin mining. Many large mining operations, including Bitdeer, are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources like hydro, solar, and wind power to reduce their carbon footprint and improve energy efficiency.

Bitcoin Price Just Made A Low Under $115,000 Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market has witnessed a wave of bearish momentum during the past day as prices across the coins have declined. BTC went into the low $114,000 levels earlier in the day, but the coin has since bounced back above $115,000. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Here? 6 Key Metrics Show Market Shift The below chart shows how the asset’s recent performance has looked. Last week, BTC also dropped toward the $115,000 mark, but back then, it was able to quickly bounce back to resume sideways movement around $118,000. As such, it only remains to be seen whether the current deviation is a temporary one as well or if it’s the start of a real break away from the consolidation range. Most of the altcoins have taken a worse hit than the number one cryptocurrency during the past day, with some like Solana (SOL) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) exceeding losses of 5%. Crypto Derivatives Market Has Racked Up Large Liquidations A consequence of the market-wide volatility has been that liquidations have piled up over at the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector, according to data from CoinGlass. Below is a table that shows the numbers related to the latest market liquidations. As is visible above, a total of $804 million in cryptocurrency contracts have found liquidation during the past day. Out of these, $741 million of the contracts, equivalent to 92% of the total, were longs. Ethereum (ETH) led the derivatives flush with $250 million in liquidations, Bitcoin followed at $200 million. ETH topping the sector in this metric over BTC is likely a combination of two factors: its price has seen a steeper decline in the last 24 hours and speculative interest around it has been elevated due to the earlier breakout. Signs were already there that a volatile liquidation event may be coming. As this chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn on Wednesday shows, the Bitcoin Aggregated Open Interest was sharply climbing. The “Aggregated Open Interest” here naturally refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to BTC that are open on all centralized exchanges.

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM) have all seen strong rallies in recent weeks—but the question now is whether that momentum can continue. At the same time, early buyers are turning attention to newer, lower-cap opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project is gaining traction for its aggressive growth pace and expanding user base, with analysts suggesting a potential upside of 37x once it hits key listings. XRP Eyes Rebound After $3.55 High XRP’s recent climb to $3.55 was followed by a correction to $3.12, where it is currently consolidating. Despite the pullback, whale accumulation continues. Many analysts believe a breakout could occur if ETF approval rumors resurface. Price Prediction: XRP could trade between $3.00 and $4.75 in the coming weeks, with upside hinging on regulatory catalysts and volume recovery. Early-Stage Frenzy Builds Anticipation MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract speculative attention. Insider reports suggest new rounds are closing within hours, as buyers aim to lock in early allocations. Some projections place the potential ROI as high as 37x , making it one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies this quarter. If momentum continues through launch and listings, the token could be the next frontier of the altcoin season. ADA Forecast Looks Strong into Protocol Launch Cardano currently trades around $0.76, still significantly below its previous all-time high. With the Midnight protocol and ecosystem updates approaching, long-term buyers are beginning to accumulate. Price Prediction: ADA could revisit the $1.00–$1.20 range in Q3, with room to move higher if network growth accelerates. Stellar Holds Steady After Rapid Climb Stellar (XLM) surged to $0.55 in July before correcting to its current level of $0.41. RSI remains neutral, showing indecision—but some expect renewed movement if broader market sentiment improves. Price Prediction: If support holds, XLM may test the $0.48–$0.52 range, while a drop below $0.39 could open downside to $0.33. Conclusion XRP, ADA, and XLM are showing signs of stabilization after recent rallies, with traders watching key support and resistance levels. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as the breakout opportunity, with forecasts of up to 37x returns for early participants—fueling growing demand during its early stages.

The cybersecurity firm Zimperium says the so-called DoubleTrouble trojan “has rapidly evolved in both its distribution methods and capabilities,” and is now permeating channels on the social platform Discord. “In its latest evolution, the malware has integrated several new and advanced features, significantly expanding its capabilities beyond earlier iterations. These enhancements enable more effective data theft, device manipulation, and evasion techniques. The new functionalities include: displaying malicious UI overlays to steal PIN codes or unlock patterns, comprehensive screen recording capabilities, the ability to block the opening of specific applications, and advanced keylogging functionality.” Researchers say the malware convinces users to download it by masking itself as an extension or an add-on, and it uses the Google Play icon to appear trustworthy. It also manipulates device functionality by exploiting Android’s Accessibility Services, allowing it to block legitimate banking or security apps with misleading “system maintenance” prompts. In addition, the malicious software simulates user actions like taps and swipes, allowing attackers to remotely control infected devices and steal data, including passwords and banking details, with alarming precision. The trojan’s attacks are ongoing, primarily targeting users in Europe through phishing websites and Discord-hosted APKs. Specific victim counts remain unknown at time of publishing.

Bitcoin dominance is rising, sending pressure across the altcoin market. Analyst says August could define Ethereum’s path for the year. The crypto market is sending mixed signals. Despite earlier hopes for an altcoin season, Bitcoin dominance in this cycle is rising, which usually means trouble for small-cap altcoins. While a few altcoins might do well, the overall altcoin market has shown signs of weakness. So while broader altcoins face pressure from BTC’s dominance, altcoin leader Ethereum still has a shot to flip the script.

Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a technical analyst on X, recently shared this observation, highlighting the performance of both assets as they approach key resistance zones after completing similar breakout patterns. This has led many market watchers to assess whether these levels will hold or finally give way. The most important resistance level for #XRP and #XLM right now! pic.twitter.com/wBlrjhUoA8 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 31, 2025 Identical Patterns and Shared Resistance In the analysis presented by Steph, XRP and XLM are seen on the weekly timeframe following near-identical falling wedge patterns . These patterns are typically considered bullish once broken to the upside, and both assets have now done exactly that. The chart reveals that both assets broke above the upper trendline of the falling wedge in July. After this breakout, each asset’s momentum appears to have stalled near notable resistance levels. XRP has reached an all-time high of $3.65 , and this level has so far held firm, stalling further upward momentum. Similarly, XLM has faced resistance around $0.51, with this ceiling capping its performance in July and preventing it from reaching a new all-time high, including XRP. Steph Is Crypto described these levels as the most important resistance for both assets, and overcoming them could open the door to significant gains for both assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Technical Implications of Resistance The resistance zones on both charts show a clear barrier that has not yet been broken decisively. For XRP, a clean break and close above this zone on the weekly chart would be viewed by many technical analysts as a confirmation of continued bullish momentum. Other prominent analysts have predicted that breaching the $3.65 level could send XRP toward double-digits . Until such a move occurs, the price could remain trapped below this level, consolidating or even retracing. XLM faces a similar scenario, where the breakout could potentially send it to a new all-time high, breaking the record it set in 2018. Legendary trader Peter Brandt recently shared bullish predictions for XLM , and if buying pressure increases, the asset could overcome this resistance and meet his expectations. For both XRP and XLM, this resistance zone is not just a technical level, but represents a psychological barrier, with traders closely watching for signs of strength or weakness.

SEC Will Set a Precedent for Crypto Industry,https://timestabloid.com/international-bar-association-ripple-xrp-v-sec-will-set-a-precedent-for-crypto-industry/,"While regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. work to establish clearer digital asset legislation, the judiciary has taken on a more immediate role in determining how cryptocurrencies are treated under existing legal frameworks. The Ripple lawsuit , specifically its handling of XRP token sales, has become a pivotal moment in U.S. crypto law. In the recent publication by the International Bar Association (IBA), titled Digital Regulations in the Metaverse Era, the Ripple case is referenced as having significant potential to influence how courts draw boundaries in token-based transactions. The analysis focuses on how the court, under Judge Analisa Torres, made a distinction between “direct contractual efforts between issuers/promoters and purchasers” versus general “market purchasing in the token space.” This differentiation could become the basis for future case law affecting both developers and investors across the cryptocurrency landscape. The International Bar Association affirms that the outcome of Ripple v. SEC will set a precedent for the entire cryptocurrency industry. This is documented below. https://t.co/aHaf8WoiE2 pic.twitter.com/0ZqnVG8X8t — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 XRP and the Judicial Line Drawn At the core of the case was whether XRP constituted a security under U.S. law. The court found that Ripple’s sales of XRP on public exchanges did not violate existing securities laws , though it did rule against Ripple’s direct sales to institutional investors. This decision ultimately provided Ripple with a legal win that many in the industry had anticipated for years, and opened up the U.S. market for XRP adoption. While the lawsuit extended much longer than that ruling, the decision was pivotal and remains unchanged despite subsequent developments in the lawsuit. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications Beyond Ripple and XRP In the highlighted section, it notes that rulings “have the potential to create a precedent in the cryptocurrency industry.” This includes how courts might interpret relationships between promoters and token buyers moving forward. Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) highlighted this development with an image from the IBA’s report, reinforcing the relevance of the precedent set by XRP. That judicial distinction could have a lasting influence on how new tokens are structured, marketed, and offered in secondary markets. Ripple fought for clarity for XRP, and now market participants can draw from this outcome when crafting token strategies that minimize legal exposure. The precedent doesn’t resolve all regulatory uncertainty, but it offers a functional distinction that may influence future enforcement actions. The cryptocurrency space is finally receiving proper regulation through the recently passed GENIUS Act , and additional bills are currently being considered by the U.S. government. XRP will always hold a unique role in setting an important precedent for crypto regulation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ethereum (ETH) are capturing outsized attention. Mutuum Finance is at a price of $0.035 during phase 6 of presale. Those investing now are guaranteed a 71.43% ROI at launch. Mutuum Finance has already sold over $13.9 million and has more than 14,800 investors on board. Alongside Ethereum (ETH), Mutuum Finance is the top crypto to buy now. Ethereum (ETH) Reclaims $3,000 Amid DeFi Summer Momentum Ethereum is currently trading at $3,618. Technical signals like the breakout from a symmetrical triangle, rising open interest, and sustained ETF inflows suggest momentum is strengthening. Common 2025 price target is ranging from $4,000 to $6,000, and some bullish forecasts extend to $7,000–$8,000 if institutional demand continues to grow. In this rising DeFi environment, interest is also shifting toward emerging protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Accelerates Growth with Phase 6 Launch Mutuum Finance is performing well in presale, selling out the 5th round ahead of schedule. The project is now in round 6 valued at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is transforming the DeFi world by creating an extensible financial system with use cases in real life. The presale has gained more than 14,800 token owners and raised more than $13.9 million. $100K Worth of Tokens Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance has also launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be awarded a $10,000 prize in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is proof of how committed the project remains towards building a long-term and loyal fan base. CertiK-Backed Bug Bounty Boosts DeFi Security In another bid towards its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team will reward a maximum of $50,000 USDT to the participants who identify likely vulnerabilities in the project. The aim of the bounty program is to obtain a suitable coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is segmented into the four classes of severity; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the commitment of the team towards the security of ecosystem along with investors’ trust. Next-Gen Dual-Lending Solutions Mutuum Finance is among the top DeFi projects on which the users are in absolute control of their assets. The project applies a double-lending mechanism for provision of flexibility alongside the effectiveness which comprises Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract uses a self-executing smart contract that conducts the lending automatically with no human intervention, programmed to respond to the change in market prices based on a floating rate of interest according to what exists at the time of the demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the middlemen and has a possibility of being directly linked to lenders and borrowers. It is even more common in meme coins because it has a possibility of having specified terms of a loan and flexibility based on the risk-bearing willingness of a user. Ethereum (ETH) may be reclaiming momentum above $3,600, but it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s turning heads with its early-stage growth. Currently in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, MUTM offers a guaranteed 71.43% ROI at launch price $0.06. The next price jump to $0.04 is coming soon. So far, over $13.9 million has been raised, and more than 14,800 investors are already in. Backed by CertiK, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 token giveaway, Mutuum Finance is the top DeFi opportunity to watch this summer.

The platform expects Ripple’s native token to outperform in the coming years, supported by institutional adoption and the rollout of tokenized financial infrastructure. Amid this surge in AI-driven interest, investors are also turning to earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which just posted its highest-ever level of weekly user interaction. The project’s momentum is fueling comparisons to the early days of many top projects – where small investments turned into life-changing gains . XRP Forecast by Year: AI Models Suggest Steady Growth Gemini AI outlines a bullish case for XRP through 2029. In the short term, the model sees XRP revisiting its previous all-time high of $3.84 as early as 2025, with upside linked to ETF speculation and cross-border settlement use cases. By 2026, the forecast estimates a climb to $6.20, driven by banking partnerships and broader regulatory clarity. If Ripple’s legal environment stabilizes, the path toward $9.30 by 2027 becomes increasingly likely. For 2028 and 2029, Gemini AI predicts XRP could break into double digits, reaching $12.75 and $15.60 respectively. These targets are tied to broader adoption of blockchain for government-backed digital currencies and improved global remittance rails. While XRP maintains its stronghold in the top crypto ranks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exploding with fresh investor momentum. This week marked its most active community participation yet, with analysts citing record-breaking growth in engagement and funding velocity. With rising demand and a finite presale allocation, early backers are eyeing returns that could rival 2021’s biggest altcoin success stories . Conclusion If Gemini AI’s model is right, XRP could see significant growth over the next five years—but the biggest winners may come from the projects just entering the spotlight now. With MAGACOIN FINANCE hitting historic engagement milestones, many investors are taking notice before the gates fully open.

The Bullish Case for Bitcoin’s Year-End Comeback,https://cryptopotato.com/from-115k-to-150k-the-bullish-case-for-bitcoins-year-end-comeback/,"As July closed out, Bitcoin suffered a notable pullback as it corrected to approximately $113K – a decline of several thousand dollars from mid-month highs north of $123K. Despite the setback, the market watchers remain bullish about the world’s largest crypto asset’s prospects for the year-end. $115K Now, $150K Soon? As Bitcoin mining enters the second half of 2025, the sector’s fundamentals remain strong, but the room for errors is shrinking. The analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash predicts that the crypto asset will trade between $130,000 and $150,000 by year-end, if the ETF inflows remain and the macroeconomic backdrop remains consistent. In a statement to CryptoPotato , TeraHash said that several factors are at play. The Federal Reserve’s expected rate cut in September, along with regulatory clarity from the SEC, CFTC, and the full implementation of Europe’s MiCA framework in Q4, are expected to play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment. “On-chain, hashrate is expected to reach ~1.2 ZH/s, with mining difficulty climbing toward 140T, driven by large-scale deployment of next-gen ASICs and geographic expansion into energy-advantaged regions such as Paraguay, Oman, and parts of Africa. But as costs rise and competition accelerates, miners without efficient hardware or access to low-cost energy will struggle to remain profitable.” At the same time, Hashrate-as-a-Service (HaaS) offerings are gaining traction among institutional investors, as they provide a lower-risk avenue to gain mining exposure. As the post-halving environment increasingly favors scale and strategic execution, the latter half of 2025 will test miners’ adaptability. “Bitcoin mining in late 2025 is about precision, adaptability, and staying ahead in a system that grows more competitive with every block.” Jaw-Dropping BTC Prediction While a certain cohort of investors has resorted to profit-taking, long-term bullish sentiment remains intact. For instance, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors came up with an even bolder prediction that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by year-end. Prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper also believes that the crypto asset could hit that milestone. Amid all the furor, financial giant Charles Schwab, as well as billionaire CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz, predict that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by the end of 2025.

Despite years of dominating blockchain payments, Ripple’s dominance of the PayFi sector now seems to be slipping, especially with newer projects gaining traction. A hot new name is Remittix (RTX) , a crypto-to-fiat settlement network that aims to make remittances and spending everywhere easier to understand.”. With price action of XRP under intense scrutiny by investors, all eyes turn toward alternatives that really offer working products — not legacy market share or court wins. XRP Price Dives, Market Flips XRP took a nose dive to $3.02, which is down 2.37% in 24 hours, even while witnessing a whopping $9.38 billion rise in trading volume. The actual fall has created rumors: is it that whales are reshuffling, or that sentiments have begun sifting in the market? Ripple has been way out in front of the blockchain payment push for years, but waiting on legal clarity and scaling answers has left room for new entrants. That is where Remittix enters the picture — not as a disruptor, but as the next chapter in PayFi. Though XRP remains a front-runner, buyers now share their portfolios, going for new tokens that have usability and small entry points. With Remittix priced at just $0.0842, the upside potential seems much more appealing to early adopters. Remittix Wallet Launch May Change the PayFi Market Arriving in Q3 2025, the Remittix Wallet is used for instant fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions across 30+ countries. It enables sending BTC, ETH, or XRP straight into a local bank account — no intermediaries, no delay. Unlike the majority of wallets, this wallet is not for storage purposes only — it’s designed for everyday payments, business, and international remittances. From Latin America freelancers to European small businesses, Remittix is the financial link they’ve been seeking. Key Remittix Wallet Features: Crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ nations Mobile-first PayFi wallet with competitive fees Real-time FX rates on every transaction 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat pairs supported Designed for global users, not just traders Remittix Project: Hype vs. Numbers The Remittix (RTX) presale is gaining momentum. With nearly $18 million in funds raised, and 578 million tokens sold, it’s clear the demand is picking up speed. Early investors now receive a 50% bonus, and this adds even more value before listings go live. The cross-chain functionality of the wallet, crypto staking, and business API plans set Remittix apart from being a hype token. It’s an operational solution with clear direction — and that separates it from 99% of presales out there.

At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading around $115,745, down approximately 2.2% in the past 24 hours and nearly 6% below its July all-time high of $123,000. The latest market movement has raised questions about short-term price stability, particularly amid growing concerns over weak structural support in the current trading zone. Recent data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant suggests that while long-term holders remain largely profitable, short-term sentiment has shifted. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? Cooling Futures Market Hints at Possible Breakout Bitcoin UTXO Data Points to Changing Investor Behavior Activity among Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), a metric that tracks coins being spent either in profit or at a loss, indicates that many investors are beginning to react to smaller price drops, potentially signaling increased market uncertainty. In a recent analysis on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, contributor Darkfost shared insights on how UTXO activity can reflect broader market sentiment. “This chart, based on UTXOs from block data, highlights the number of UTXOs spent either in profit or in loss,” the analyst wrote, noting that this approach focuses on transaction count rather than value, helping filter out price-based noise. Historically, Bitcoin has seen a dominance of UTXOs spent in profit, with patient holders benefiting from long-term appreciation. Between July 11 and 13, the ratio of profitable UTXOs compared to those spent at a loss surged above 10,000, meaning for every loss-making spend, there were over ten thousand profitable ones. However, this ratio has since declined to around 500, suggesting that some investors are now closing positions at a loss even with minor price retracements. This change, according to Darkfost, may indicate short-term selling pressure despite the overall profitable status of most holders. Weak Support Structure Adds to Downside Risk Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, highlighted structural weaknesses in Bitcoin’s recent price surge. On July 10, BTC rapidly climbed from $112,000 to $115,800, but this upward move left little on-chain support in the price range. Bitcoin Teleported from $112 to $115.8K – But There’s Thin Air Below “From a technical point of view, there’s no past resistance or consolidation that could now act as support. If this final support area breaks, price could move down quickly.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/a3hQoANfDc — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 1, 2025 “The move happened so quickly that no support levels were formed,” the analyst explained. “If momentum drops or sellers step in, the price could fall just as fast as it rose.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Calm Before the Storm?

The model anticipates key momentum from rising transaction volumes, network adoption, and use cases in sectors like gaming and DeFi. As more investors seek early exposure to promising altcoins, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also drawing serious attention. With interest accelerating and presale access tightening, analysts say it may represent one of the last remaining early-stage opportunities with immense potential. Solana Could Surge to $315, Says Gemini AI According to Gemini AI’s base-case projection, Solana could hit $550 by 2029, with a potential high of around $590-600 if current adoption trends hold. The platform has recently seen a spike in developer activity, increased institutional integrations, and expanding retail engagement—factors that strengthen its long-term growth case. These predictions are supported by sustained demand for Solana-based NFT marketplaces, payment apps, and staking protocols. If the macro environment remains favorable, Gemini’s model assigns a 72% probability of Solana delivering a 2–3x return by 2030 . Presale Access Dwindles as MAGACOIN FINANCE Heats Up Amid the growing interest in altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now attracting a flood of investor activity , with many comparing its momentum to the early days of projects like SHIBA INU and even Solana itself. Presale spots are rapidly disappearing, and participation metrics show a sharp rise in new buyer engagement. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its approach to sustainable growth and ecosystem expansion. Unlike flash-in-the-pan meme tokens, this project offers actual utility, a clear roadmap, and strategic staking rewards . For those seeking to enter before the wave of exchange listings, the window to act is closing fast. What Could Fuel Solana’s Next Rally? Solana’s future depends on continued scaling and sustained user engagement. If the network can maintain uptime stability, reduce congestion, and retain its edge in low-cost transactions, Gemini AI believes the asset will remain a top performer in the Layer-1 race. With Ethereum’s scaling challenges still unresolved, Solana’s speed and ecosystem-wide upgrades could keep it front and center in the next crypto bull market. Combined with a broader shift toward utility-driven altcoins, Solana remains one of the most closely watched assets heading into 2026, but MAGACOIN is beginning to take the spotlight..

Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-dominance-still-in-most-bullish-formation-heres-what-to-expect/,"XRP Dominance is once again in a defining moment, with its current structure on the monthly time frame suggesting a potential for significant upward movement. According to prominent crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), the digital asset’s market cap dominance remains in what he describes as “the most bullish formation.” The accompanying chart illustrates a long-term bullish pennant pattern , a setup that historically carries a strong likelihood of breaking upward, typically between 60% and 65%, based on EGRAG’s notes. #XRP Dominance – Still in the Most Bullish Formation! #XRP Dominance is currently navigating a crucial threshold! It’s vital that it remains above 4.5% to keep the bullish pennant formation intact. Remember, we’re analyzing this on a monthly time frame, which means the… pic.twitter.com/8Mdwou7sU7 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 1, 2025 Monthly Structure and Key Levels The chart presents a clear structure dating back several years, where XRP Dominance has respected a descending channel. Within this context, recent price action has moved above a key long-term resistance zone, currently undergoing a crucial retest. EGRAG CRYPTO states the importance of holding the 4.5% level, stating that maintaining this level is vital for the continuation of the bullish pennant formation. Another analyst recently drew attention to the shifting market sentiment as traders are moving away from Bitcoin to altcoins . The chart shows that XRP Dominance has tested major support zones on multiple occasions. Each of these retests preceded major upward movements. These helped it reach current levels. Now, the asset appears to be mirroring this behavior once again. Breakout Potential and Target Zones The white rectangular region on the chart, positioned around the 4.5% to 5.75% range, represents a historically significant resistance zone that could soon become support. The market is currently engaging with this region, and a successful hold above it could validate the bullish turn. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Above this area lies what EGRAG refers to as the “VOID,” a region lacking major historical resistance, potentially allowing XRP to shift toward a price discovery phase . Projected targets are outlined at 21% and 27%. These translate to $13.34 and $17.15, placing XRP firmly within double-digit territory . Additionally, the analyst highlighted crucial resistance levels, aligning with Fibonacci extension levels. These are 11.44% (Fib. 0.702), 15.22% (Fib. 0.786), 21.54% (Fib. 0.888), and 31.54% (Fib. 1). At current market values, these translate to $7.27, $9.67, $13.68, and $20.04. It’s also important to note that this analysis is built on a monthly timeframe. As EGRAG emphasizes, signals on this scale are typically more stable and less prone to short-term volatility. Supporting indicators such as moving averages and long-term trendlines are also integrated into the chart, showing the gradual curvature upward, supporting the notion of building bullish momentum.

After years of legal battles and price stagnation, the token is finally showing signs of breakout potential. With the SEC lawsuit mostly behind it and increasing interest from institutional players, XRP may be on the verge of reclaiming the momentum it once had during its all-time high days. While XRP continues to capture attention, emerging altcoins are also gaining rapid traction. One standout is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project now drawing comparisons to Dogecoin’s historic rally . Analysts note that early-stage growth, community enthusiasm, and a swelling holder base are beginning to mirror what DOGE experienced before its mainstream explosion . XRP Price Forecast: Will 2025 Be the Breakout Year? Many analysts now point to $2.50–$3.00 as a realistic range for XRP by the end of 2025, assuming regulatory clarity holds and utility adoption expands. The return of institutional trust, fueled by growing cross-border partnerships and the potential for new ETFs, could accelerate demand. One of the bullish indicators lies in the increased on-chain activity for XRP, which has risen steadily since mid-2024. Coupled with Ripple’s expansion into Asia and the Middle East, the network could gain further traction in high-volume corridors where traditional banking remains inefficient. Rapid Momentum Sparks Investor Buzz As XRP regains its footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining fast among those hunting for the next breakout. The project has seen a surge in demand, with round allocations selling out rapidly. What’s driving the hype is a combination of strong community engagement, expanding use cases, and new milestones achieved almost weekly. Some traders now speculate that early MAGACOIN FINANCE buyers could see gains rivaling DOGE’s epic run, especially with the presale stages nearing their final rounds . Momentum metrics have hit all-time highs , with analysts warning that presale access may soon vanish entirely for new participants. For those watching the next potential meme-to-mainstream story unfold, this may be the last window to get in early. What to Watch for XRP Next While XRP’s move back to $3 would represent a major victory for long-term holders, it would still leave room for additional upside should mass adoption accelerate. Analysts caution that XRP still faces headwinds from a saturated altcoin market and lingering regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. But if current trends hold, XRP could position itself as a leader in global payments once again. Conclusion XRP’s path toward a $3 valuation by the end of 2025 appears increasingly realistic as investor confidence returns and institutional interest rises. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of the year, with momentum building in ways that echo Dogecoin’s legendary climb. Both assets offer compelling narratives—but one is still available at ground-floor levels.

The price is hovering around $114,670 , testing an important liquidity zone between $115K and $116K , while a stronger support lies in the $110K–$112K range if the drop continues. Recent price movements have cleared out short-term liquidity, which could prepare the market for a breakout once consolidation wraps up. The key resistance to watch is $119,504, a level that has rejected upward moves recently. A breakout above this could pave the way for Bitcoin to challenge its all-time high again. Van de Poppe suggests that August might act as a stabilization phase, potentially setting the stage for a renewed rally towards the end of the month, not just for Bitcoin but also for altcoins.",,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-08-02 08:31:04

Here Are the Details,https://timestabloid.com/ripples-occ-banking-license-application-is-now-available-here-are-the-details/,"Ripple’s ambition to expand its financial infrastructure took a formal step with the release of Volume 1 of its Interagency Charter Application, submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman), a crypto commentator on X, shared an analysis of the document, which outlines the company’s proposal to establish Ripple National Trust Bank . This is a limited-purpose national trust bank that would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ripple Labs and be headquartered in New York. Though Ripple has been synonymous with the digital asset XRP, the application focuses more on its native stablecoin RLUSD. #Ripple ’s OCC Banking License application is now available! Vol. 1 is the public release. The application provides some clues about Ripple’s intentions and structure to consider. 1/6 pic.twitter.com/Qzr0dIASdD — WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) August 2, 2025 The Purpose of Ripple’s Bank As the filing shows , Ripple is not applying for a traditional banking license involving deposit-taking or lending activities. Instead, the bank will handle fiduciary activities, enabling it to provide custody and infrastructure services in line with OCC oversight. Importantly, the trust bank will not fall under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which applies only to institutions that engage in lending or deposit activities. The application states that, “as a national trust bank, the Trust Bank will not be subject to the CRA.” This positions the bank squarely within a business-to-business (B2B) framework, focused on custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management, rather than retail banking. WrathofKahneman drew attention to XRP’s absence from the application. He believes that this move may be an intentional separation to avoid entangling a regulated banking entity with XRP because it has faced legal scrutiny . Still, the absence does not rule out a future XRP integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Confidential Strategy and Potential IPO Another dimension to the filing relates to Ripple’s internal structure and compensation plans. The application references a confidential stock benefit plan included in an unpublished exhibit, indicating that the company will issue private stock to executives and insiders. While this practice is not unusual, WrathofKahneman noted that the confidentiality suggests a broader corporate strategy, potentially in anticipation of increased scrutiny or even a future Initial Public Offering (IPO) . Ripple’s Commitment to Experience and Expertise The Trust Bank’s operational and governance structure also reveals Ripple’s commitment to experienced oversight. The initial list of organizers includes John McDonald, a seasoned financial executive and President of Standard Custody & Trust Company, and John Zavaglia, Ripple’s Treasurer with extensive experience in corporate finance and treasury operations. It also includes Stuart Alderoty , Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, with over 35 years in regulatory and legal leadership across major financial institutions, Timothy Keaney, a former Vice Chairman of BNY Mellon, and David Puth, former CEO of CLS Group and Centre Consortium. Together, they will form the initial five-member board of directors, with Ripple retaining full ownership of the entity.

Hines noted that the US has officially established a digital asset reserve, and that Bitcoin is considered a “unique asset class.” The government’s goal is to “hold as much Bitcoin as possible.” Trump officially established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and National Digital Asset Stockpile with an executive order he signed in March. However, the initiative received only brief mention in the White House's cryptocurrency policy report released this week. Speaking on Crypto in America, Hines said, “We believe in the accumulation strategy. The reserve has been established. We also have a strategic national digital asset stockpile. Bitcoin is in a class of its own, and everyone recognizes that.” Related News: Is the Rally in XRP Over or Just Getting Started? Pay Close Attention to These Levels Hines emphasized that establishing the infrastructure requires time and effort, but that the process is progressing well. “There's still a lot to do, but I believe people will like the direction we're heading. Concrete steps will be taken soon.” While the report cited establishing a regulatory framework to strengthen American leadership in digital financial technologies as a top priority, it did not provide details about the Bitcoin reserve. Hines, however, said the reserve plan was “steadily progressing.” Hines, who declined to answer questions about how much Bitcoin the federal government holds, said, “I can't disclose that right now. There are a few reasons, but we can share them when the time comes. All I can say is, we want to own as much BTC as we can, and we're working toward that goal.” According to blockchain analysis firm Nansen, the US government is estimated to hold approximately 198,000 BTC, or approximately $2.35 billion worth of assets. *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Mill City plans to raise $500M to expand its SUI token treasury after a $450M initial investment. The stock dropped over 11% following the announcement, despite being up 165% since July 24. Mill City is positioning itself as the first institutional-grade Sui treasury with official backing. The announcement came just days after Mill City secured $450 million via the sale of 83 million shares to institutional investors, including Pantera Capital, Electric Capital, ParaFi Capital, and FalconX. The firm used those funds to purchase 76.2 million SUI tokens valued at $276 million. The remaining capital will support its existing short-term lending operations. Mill City Stock Sinks After Announcing $500M Equity Line Shares of the finance firm dropped 11.4% to $4.91 on Friday following the announcement, with after-hours trading extending losses by another 4.28%, according to Google Finance. “This equity line is intended to give us the firepower to scale our position as the only Sui treasury on the market with an official Sui Foundation relationship,” said Stephen Mackintosh, Mill City’s Chief Investment Officer. He described the move as a step toward offering institutional-grade exposure to the Sui ecosystem through public markets. Mill City’s strategy aligns with a growing trend among public companies to diversify their crypto treasuries beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. In recent weeks, firms have added BNB, Solana, and XRP to their portfolios. Welcome to Sui, Mill City Ventures. With Mill City’s launch today, everyone can access Sui on Nasdaq.

The firm’s new $500 million equity line was arranged with Alliance Global Partners and is intended to further scale its position in SUI. While investors initially reacted negatively, the broader trajectory of MCVT stock remains bullish, it’s still up 165% since July 24, when the SUI initiative was first unveiled. Galaxy Asset Management is overseeing Mill City’s SUI holdings as the official treasury manager. At the time of writing, SUI is trading at $3.45, down 2.4% on the day, mirroring the wider market downturn. Crypto Treasuries Aren’t Really Buying Crypto A growing number of publicly traded companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build crypto treasuries, but one analyst says many aren’t actually buying digital assets from the open market . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders. Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

49411623,https://invezz.com/?p=2823869,1754125143,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Best presale crypto for early gains: BPENGU offers up to 75% before listing,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/02/best-presale-crypto-for-early-gains-bpengu-offers-up-to-75-before-listing/,"July 2025 marked a historic month for crypto investment funds, attracting a staggering $11.2 billion in inflows and pushing total assets under management (AUM) to around $221 billion, a clear signal that institutional excitement and retail interest are converging in unprecedented fashion. Amid this surge, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU) is emerging as a standout opportunity with its limited 30-day presale launching July 28 and a confirmed listing date set for September 2, 2025. With a hard cap of $10 million, this exclusive presale window is poised to close fast, rewarding early supporters with rising token prices every two days across 15 stages. Bitcoin Penguins is where crypto meets cool Bitcoin Penguins is where meme culture waddle meets Bitcoin’s legendary pedigree. By fusing the viral momentum of penguin-themed NFTs with Bitcoin’s status as digital gold, BPENGU is more than a token, it’s a movement. Tailored for the crypto crowd craving both fun and fundamentals, BPENGU runs on Solana’s blazing-fast blockchain, offering low fees, high scalability, and a smart presale design. The presale spans 15 stages over 30 days, each with a 5% price increase to reward early buyers handsomely. Purchase in Stage 1, and you secure tokens at $0.00100 before prices climb, potentially gaining over 75% before listing. Smart presale designed for growth Beyond its compelling narrative, BPENGU’s presale mechanics stand out as a technical feature crafted to reward early investors while maintaining sustainable demand. The 15-stage flash presale spans 30 days, with each stage lasting approximately two days and featuring a 5% price increment. Early-stage buyers benefit from significantly discounted entry, securing a low price of $0.00100 in Stage 1. By Stage 15, tokens will be priced near $0.00198, incentivizing urgent participation. The presale hard cap is set at $10 million, adding scarcity and urgency. By gradually increasing the price across presale stages, the model encourages early participation and discourages last-minute FOMO buys. It’s designed to build a strong, invested community that’s in it for more than just a quick flip. Out of the 10 billion total BPENGU tokens, more than half, 55% are set aside for presale participants. The remaining supply is split across staking, liquidity, community initiatives, and team allocations, aiming to keep things fair, transparent, and built for the long haul. Penguins, profits, and presale perks-BPENGU has it all July’s record $11.2 billion inflows into crypto funds signal growing investor confidence, especially in altcoins and Ethereum-based assets. Ethereum alone absorbed $1.59 billion in inflows, outpacing Bitcoin, which recently saw minor outflows, an early sign that altseason may be dawning. BPENGU is perfectly timed to capitalize on this shift. With Bitcoin’s ongoing macro momentum and altcoin enthusiasm heating up, BPENGU’s presale offers rare access to a token that combines meme culture hype with Bitcoin-backed credibility. The confirmed September 2 listing means tokens won’t linger in limbo, while the 15-stage dynamic pricing rewards swift action. Altcoins like Solana and XRP also saw strong inflows, proving the appetite for promising projects is alive and well. BPENGU’s roadmap is ambitious, targeting a $2 price point by November 2025, implying a possible 1000x return from presale prices. Strategic partnerships, community competitions, and innovative staking programs further boost its appeal for high-risk, high-reward investors ready to ride the next wave.

Today, everyone is looking forward to learning when precisely Remittix (RTX) would be next in line. Unlike the majority of memecoins, Remittix is set to combine true utility in the real world with blockchain technology, aiming to facilitate easier cross-border payments and sustainable growth through its ongoing project and the upcoming beta wallet launch. Current Market Statistics for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin currently trades at $0.2060, down 4.94%, with a market cap of around $30.97 billion and a trading volume of $3.06 billion. Shiba Inu trades at $0.00001214, down 4.94%, with a market cap of around $7.15 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of around $285 million. These figures indicate the scale of their popularity and volumes of trading regardless of the recent price declines. They have largely increased due to buzz generated by communities and viral popularity. What Remittix Is Original and Its Project Success Remittix (RTX) has a price of $0.0895 per token with over 578 million tokens sold and almost $18 million worth raised from its presale. The project is developed as a cross-chain DeFi platform that enables one to send cryptocurrencies straight into everyday bank accounts in 30+ countries. This focus on utilitarian use makes Remittix stand out from memecoins driven by speculation. Remittix also announced its Q3 2025 scheduled beta wallet release recently. The wallet supports over 40 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies, supports real-time FX conversion, and has a mobile-first design. The project’s smart contract has also been audited by CertiK, furthering its trust and security guarantee. The sharp price increases of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin were led by social media sentiment and speculative buying. Remittix is more practical in its approach, targeting real crypto use cases like instant, low-cost cross-border transactions and staking for cryptocurrencies. With a 50% token bonus surviving and the $18 million soft cap target in reach, Remittix is making serious waves. The beta wallet release will continue to increase adoption, making it a project to watch for early-stage cryptocurrency investing. Why Remittix Is Positioned for Sustainable Growth Problem solving for real-world payments across borders Low gas fee crypto project with high transaction speeds Over $17.92 million raised in presale, with growing community Future mobile wallet launch in Q3 2025 for ease of use Security-driven approach with support of CertiK audits As the crypto space matures, projects like Remittix that emphasize innovation and real utility can realize steady, long-term growth. Becoming as mainstream as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin might not be immediate, but Remittix’s approach is more favorable to crypto long-term value creation.

After months of consolidation below the $0.50 mark, traders are now eyeing bullish signals that could send the price higher, especially with broader altcoin sentiment improving. Historical patterns show that ADA tends to lag behind Bitcoin’s rallies before staging abrupt catch-ups—a trend that could repeat in the coming weeks. With traders anticipating positive ETF rulings and more clarity around blockchain regulation, many are also watching smaller cap plays emerging under the radar. One such name that continues to gain traction across crypto forums and X (Twitter) is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-rising altcoin that’s now topping social media engagement charts and quickly climbing the meme coin ladder. What Could ADA Be Worth in August 2025? According to projections from Perplexity AI and Gemini-based models, Cardano could trade between $0.68 and $1.10 by late August, assuming Bitcoin sustains its $80K+ range and altcoin liquidity remains strong. A mid-range target of $0.89 has been assigned by technical forecasters based on support-resistance zones on the weekly chart. This would represent an 80%+ rise from ADA’s current range if confirmed. Fueling this optimism are developments in the Cardano ecosystem, including the Midnight sidechain and more frequent mentions of ADA in ETF speculation reports. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that any delay in broader market recovery could push ADA’s surge into Q4 instead. A New Contender Dominates the Meme Coin Buzz While large-cap assets like ADA wait for confirmation, one emerging altcoin is already dominating buzz metrics, with multiple trend-tracking platforms now placing it above traditional meme tokens in user mentions and engagement. The project’s early-stage phase is drawing comparisons to the explosive early days of SHIBA INU – but with more structure and actual development milestones in place. With early-stage slots filling rapidly and round closings happening in record time, some are now calling it a top contender for 2025’s breakout altcoin. A small sum invested today could potentially mirror previous meme token surges and turn into a fortune, based on past cycles and current entry prices. Investors are watching closely as major exchange listings appear to be on the horizon. What Could Push ADA Higher? Several catalysts could propel ADA toward the upper end of its projected range. These include an ETF announcement involving Cardano, a successful Midnight airdrop event, and renewed whale accumulation patterns. Developer activity remains high, and ADA’s DeFi ecosystem has grown steadily, giving it more long-term utility than some competitors. Still, it’s the broader crypto sentiment that may ultimately determine ADA’s August performance. If Bitcoin breaks new highs and capital rotates into quality altcoins, Cardano could see a delayed but strong upside reaction. Conclusion Cardano may be on the edge of a potential rebound as technical indicators and market sentiment start to turn. With price models forecasting up to $1.10 and the altcoin market heating up, ADA remains one to watch in August 2025. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight in the meme coin space, rapidly overtaking old favorites with record-breaking activity and community growth.

This follows a concerning trend that has been developing this year, which suggests that theft from digital asset services could reach a new milestone by the end of 2025. Related Reading: ‘Hated Rally’ Coming? Pump.Fun (PUMP) Soars 30% From Lows Amid Token Buybacks Crypto Exchanges Lose $114 Million In July On Friday, security firm PeckShield noted that the total losses from crypto hacks reached $142 million in July, with crypto exchanges topping the list. CoinDCX, GMX, and BigONE recorded 80% of the total losses. Notably, Indian exchange CoinDCX suffered the highest loss of the month after a security breach on July 19 resulted in the transfer of $44 million in USDT from one of the platform’s wallets to six unknown personal wallets. Hackers were able to access the crypto exchange’s system after compromising an employee’s login credentials. Recent reports revealed that the employee was allegedly lured into a fake job task and persuaded to download and use his CoinDCX-designated laptop to complete tasks, unsuspectingly downloading files with malware. Meanwhile, Perpetual and spot crypto exchange GMX recorded the second-largest hack of the month after losing around $42 million on July 9 when an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the protocol’s first version on Arbitrum. GMX V1’s vault contract had a vulnerability that allowed the attacker to manipulate the GLP token price through the system’s calculations, resulting in approximately $42 million worth of assets being transferred from the GLP pool to an unknown wallet. Nonetheless, the incident saw a happy ending after the hacker accepted a white-hat bounty and returned most of the funds. As reported by NewsBTC, the exploiter returned $10.49 million worth of FRAX and 10,000 ETH, valued at $30 million, on July 11. 2025 Alarming Trend Continues Based on data from PeckShield’s previous reports, Q2 showed a diminishing trend in total crypto losses, with May and June recording 40% and 56% month-on-month (MoM) declines, respectively. However, the short-term trend changed in July as the total value of stolen funds surged 27.2% from June’s $111.6 million. Additionally, the total number of major incidents slightly increased by 13.3%, from 15 registered incidents in June to 17 hacks in July. This follows a broader trend developing this year, as Chainalysis explained on its “2025 Crypto Crime Mid-Year Update.” In the report, the on-chain analytics firm revealed that crypto theft this year has been “more devastating” than the entirety of 2024, with over $2.7 billion worth of funds stolen from crypto services in the first half. Related Reading: Ethereum Celebrates 10 Years: Coinbase CEO Shares Vitalik Buterin Anecdote As ETH Eyes $4,000 By the end of June, more value had been stolen year-to-date (YTD) than during the same period in 2022, suggesting that theft from crypto services could potentially increase another 60% by year’s end. Additionally, YTD activity shows a steeper trajectory into the end of the first half, with an alarming velocity and consistency, than in previous years. For reference, 2025 required 142 days to hit the $2 billion mark in value stolen from platforms, while 2022 reached this volume in 214 days. “If this trend continues, we could see 2025 end with more than $4.3 billion stolen from services alone,” the report forecasted.

The server will feature enterprise-grade specs including an AMD 9950X CPU, 256GB RAM, and a 10GB unmetered connection. Reserved slots will support key XRPL infrastructure, while remaining capacity will be open to the public on a best-effort basis. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, announced on Saturday he is ‘ independently’ deploying a new, high-performance server hub for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to better support its validators and applications. In a detailed post on X, Schwartz explained that the initiative is his personal project and not affiliated with Ripple , despite his role at the company. He noted that after a few years of not running his own XRPL infrastructure, he identified the need for a high-quality hub to serve XRPL ecosystem in a reliable and stable manner. “This would be my server run by me with no official connection to Ripple other than that I’m a Ripple employee,” Schwartz stated.

With multiple altcoins in the red as well, including a new all-time low for Pi, it’s no wonder that the total crypto market cap has dumped by nearly $250 billion in a few days. BTC Keeps Dropping The primary cryptocurrency experienced a brief retracement at the end of the previous business week when it dipped from $119,000 to under $115,000 amid substantial sell-offs by Galaxy Digital on behalf of a client. However, once the sale was completed, BTC recovered most losses and even headed toward $120,000 after the weekend. The bears were quick to intercept the move and didn’t allow another price jump. Bitcoin remained calm until Wednesday, when the latest FOMC meeting was scheduled to take place. Despite the positive US GDP data for Q2 and Trump’s continued pleas for rate reduction, Powell and company left them unchanged for a fifth consecutive time. BTC reacted with an immediate price slip to under $116,000 but bounced off and challenged $119,000 on Thursday morning. However, more Trump-induced volatility followed amid new tariff developments and nuclear sub movements, and bitcoin plunged below $113,000 on Friday evening for the first time since July 10. It has recovered around a grand since then, but it’s still 1% in the red daily and 3% down weekly. Its market cap is down to $2.260 trillion, while its dominance stands tall at 60%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XRP Fares Well Most larger-cap alts have followed BTC on the way south, with even bigger price declines. ETH has slipped below $3,500 after a 4% daily drop, SOL is below $165, while DOGE, HYPE, LINNK, BCH, and HBAR have retraced by around 3-4%. Pi Network’s native token dumped to another all-time low earlier today, while ENA has plunged by 7%. There are a few exceptions from the larger-cap alts, including XRP and LTC, which are slightly in the green. TON has risen by over 3.5% to almost $3.6. The total crypto market cap has dumped to $3.750 trillion on CG. This means that the metric has lost roughly $250 billion since Thursday’s peak. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Rieder, the asset management giant’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note to clients that Friday’s tepid jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics could convince the Fed to institute a larger cut than expected, according to a new report from CNBC. “If slack in the labor force builds at all, or we continue to see a below 100,000 jobs hiring rate persistently, we would expect the Fed to start moving rates lower, and a 50-basis point cut in September might be possible depending on how the data evolves.” The new labor report indicated total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 73,000 jobs in July, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 100,000. The CME FedWatch Tool, which generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices, estimates there’s an 80.3% chance the Fed will cut the federal target rate by 25 basis points at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, up from 37.7% on Thursday. However, the tool currently estimates there’s zero chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference this week that no decisions have been made about September’s potential policy choices.

These movements, totaling 500 million and 200 million XRP, respectively, were publicly identified via blockchain monitoring platforms and later shared by crypto analyst Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) on X. The transactions took place just minutes apart, with the 500 million XRP lock occurring at 05:44 UTC and the 200 million XRP lock registered at 05:43 UTC. While these transactions are part of Ripple’s routine escrow system , they come at a moment of heightened attention to XRP’s performance. JUST IN: Ripple locks 700M $XRP (worth over $2.08B) back into escrow 500M XRP 200M XRP pic.twitter.com/99Z9whpQDp — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 2, 2025 How Ripple’s Escrow Works Ripple’s escrow system was introduced in 2017 to address long-standing concerns about XRP’s circulating supply. Through this mechanism, 55 billion XRP were initially placed into a series of time-locked contracts, with a maximum of 1 billion XRP released monthly. Some experts believe this escrow system protects XRP’s price , and the company retains the option to place unused XRP back into escrow. That’s precisely what appears to have occurred here. These relocks help preserve scarcity and reduce fears of oversupply, which can impact market sentiment. Can Escrow Activity Push XRP Above Crucial Support? At the time of the escrow activity, XRP traded just below $3, a crucial support level it lost on August 1 . Investors have expressed concern about the asset’s trajectory, as this decline came less than two weeks after the asset hit a new all-time high . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Although the asset has lost the $3 mark, it has shown relative strength, staying just under $3 instead of falling further. This strength may be attributed to renewed institutional interest , ongoing developments in Ripple’s international partnerships, and the buyers in the market defending the asset from continued declines. Ripple’s escrow sales might contribute to the buying pressure, potentially pushing XRP back above $3 and securing that support level. In some past cycles, these large-scale escrow locks have been seen as stabilizing forces. However, the current market reaction remains muted. While the escrow system has its critics, experts in the crypto space have consistently pushed back against them , as many see the system as a positive force in the market. Market watchers continue to monitor how Ripple’s escrow decisions correlate with the digital asset’s price action.

In its recent post on blogging platform X, the crypto lobby group urged the Senate to rethink how it plans to regulate the decentralized finance industry. According to the post, DeFi Education Fund said the call became necessary after it reviewed the recently published discussion draft on a key crypto market structure bill. The response , signed on behalf of several DeFi Education Fund members, including a16z Crypto, Paradigm, and Uniswap, noted that regulators need to craft the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 (RFA) bill in a tech-neutral manner. DeFi Education Fund wants protection for crypto developers The Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 was released by Republican leaders on the Senate Banking Committee, noting that it was built on the CLARITY Act passed in the House of Representatives last week. The discussion draft was released by four Republican senators, including banking committee chairman Tim Scott and digital assets subcommittee chairman Cynthia Lummis. “My colleagues in the House and Senate and I share the same goal: provide clear rules of the road for digital assets,” said Tim Scott. While the Republicans had pushed three crypto bills in the House with bipartisan support at the time, they were only able to pass the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation of US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act through both chambers before it was signed into law by US President Donald Trump. At the time, Scott and Lummis promised to have the market structure bill passed by the Senate before October. Reacting to the draft bill, DeFi Education Fund mentioned that crypto developers need to be protected from what they called an “inappropriate regulation meant for intermediaries,” noting that it is important for all Americans to have self-custody rights. In a letter addressed to the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott and Senators Lummis, Hagerty, and Britt, it urged them to look into illicit finance, but make sure it doesn’t unfairly burden DeFi innovation. Senate Banking Committee welcomes feedback on the draft bill The banking committee had initially requested feedback on the discussion draft to aid their commitment towards building on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, to promote innovation in the DeFi industry, which is presently worth around $141 billion, without compromising consumer protections or financial stability. In their letter, the group also urged lawmakers to update FinCEN guidance in light of the issues of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm. “The rulemaking should reflect that technology that solely consists of non-custodial, non-controlling software shall not be regulated as a financial institution or financial intermediary,” the letter said. In addition, the crypto lobby group also called for federal preemption of state laws to ensure that there are optimal protections for crypto developers. “Well-resourced traditional financial institutions may exploit the fragmented regulatory landscape by funding or encouraging state-level enforcement actions against DeFi developers — not to protect consumers, but to stifle competition,” the crypto lobby group said. The crypto lobby group was not the only body with a response to the Senate Banking Committee, with a16z Crypto also submitting a separate response. According to a16z , its main criticism of the bill is that it risks undermining investor protections by creating loopholes, especially through the way it treats “ancillary assets.” The firm is arguing that revamping these assets without changes is incompatible with existing US Securities law, especially the Howey Test. A16z Crypto warns that the proposal could allow insiders to exploit exemptions and dump tokens on the public without oversight from the regulatory bodies. The firm, however, advocates for a digital commodity model that will present clear decentralization requirements.

While Cardano continues its steady pace, attention is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a high-potential DeFi disruptor quietly building momentum before a possible parabolic move. Mutuum Finance is in presale phase 6 at $0.035, a 16.17% price hike from the previous phase. Investors who enter at this point are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment at launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has generated over $13.9 million and has been bought by more than 14800 unique holders. And while XRP holds its place as a steady force in the market, Mutuum Finance could steal the spotlight in the months ahead. XRP Edges Ahead on Utility and Momentum XRP is currently trading around $3.12, supported above the key $2.95–$3.00 zone after a recent breakout of a long-term trendline and resistance flip near $2.35, setting the stage for potential upside toward $4.80 in the near term if volume holds up. Meanwhile, Cardano offers strong decentralization and long-term DeFi vision, but its slower transaction speeds, higher fees, and delayed adoption may limit short‑term explosive potential. As traders weigh real-world use cases and capital rotation, interest is increasingly shifting toward rising DeFi coins like Mutuum Finance. Two-Tier Decentralized Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a non-custodial asset control and liquidity protocol on decentralized lending. The project features a Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending platform with the aim of achieving flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes the strengths of smart contracts to extend loans with zero human intervention and the smart contracts respond flexibly to the market by suggesting variable interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model replaces middlemen and enables direct communication between lenders and borrowers. The model is very user-friendly for the management of unstable assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Presale Hits Phase 6, Join the Momentum Mutuum Finance is picking up a lot of steam as its presale phases close rapidly. The project is currently in phase 6 of the presale at $0.035. The price for the subsequent phase will increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Projected to launch at $0.06, phase 6 investors are poised to get a 71.43% return on investment. Demand for investments is increasing with the project already exceeding $13.9 million and already boasting over 14800 token holders. Mutuum Finance Unveils Plans for USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is creating a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited by CertiK, an experienced blockchain security firm. Apart from investors’ guarantee of code base integrity and transparency, the auditing process conducted guarantees that the project will in fact create a secure DeFi protocol. The project has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The four categories of vulnerability to be rewarded are classified as critical, major, minor and low. Cardano (ADA) may offer long-term vision, and XRP continues to climb on utility strength. But neither is moving as fast as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With the token now in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, investors are locking in a 71.43% ROI ahead of its $0.06 launch. The next price jump to $0.04 is just around the corner. Backed by over $13.9 million raised, 14,800+ investors, a $50K bug bounty, and plans for a USD-pegged stablecoin, MUTM is shaping up to be one of the biggest DeFi plays of 2025. Secure your tokens today before Phase 6 ends.

Arthur Hayes sold $13M in ETH, ENA, and PEPE today. Hayes warns of Q3 tariffs, weak job data, slowing credit. The crypto market faced a sudden and steep sell-off today, with Ethereum leading the drop, falling over 5% in the last 24 hours. Adding to the market wide sell-off, Arthur Hayes, analyst and co-founder of BitMEX, sold off a portion of his holdings as well: 2,373 ETH worth around $8.32 million, 7.76 million ENA tokens worth $4.62 million, and 38.86 billion PEPE tokens valued at $414,700, all within just six hours. Many were left wondering why Hayes, known for his strategic market calls, chose to sell instead of buying the dip. According to Hayes, the answer lies in the economic outlook. He warned that the US will soon face serious pressure from upcoming Q3 tariff payments and pointed out the disappointing non-farm payroll data, which shows weakening job growth. Y?

Meanwhile, the XRP community is buzzing with anticipation over potential new highs this month. The article delves into whether these cryptocurrencies can overcome their barriers and maintain growth in the coming weeks. Solana Market Snapshot: Balancing Recovery and Resistance Levels SOL recorded a 15.63% gain over the past month while enduring a 20.19% decline in the last six months. A one-week drop of 7.10% indicates short-term weakness despite recent price movements within a range of $142.76 to $204.07. This behavior reflects notable fluctuations and mixed momentum, with recent gains not fully offsetting its longer-term downtrend. Current price activity shows SOL trading between $142.76 and $204.07 with immediate resistance at $235.84 and early support around $113.22. A second resistance at $297.15 and support at $51.91 provide additional context. Technical indicators present mixed signals: an Awesome Oscillator at 10.28, a Momentum reading of -35.81, and an RSI of 46.50 suggest market uncertainty. Bulls and bears are in a delicate balance with no clear trend. Traders might look to enter on dips toward $113.22, targeting exits near $235.84 resistance, while remaining cautious of quick reversals. XRP Market Update: Strong Monthly Rally Amid Steady 6-Month Growth XRP experienced a vibrant jump over the past month with a gain of nearly 38%. It has seen a steady increase of roughly 4% over the last six months, indicating a period of consolidation after a sharp short-term rally. Price fluctuations have steered the coin between a lower boundary of about $2.23 and an upper limit near $3.74. The recent monthly surge suggests renewed interest and momentum, in contrast to a more contained long-term performance that reflects the market digesting earlier gains. Currently, the price hovers near a support level at $1.43 while facing resistance at $4.45, with a second resistance target around $5.97. Indicators show a mixed picture, with a neutral relative strength index around 50 and a slightly negative momentum indicator. Oscillators provide a blend of bullish and bearish hints, leaving the trend somewhat undefined. Traders should monitor the range between support and immediate resistance for activity; a move above $4.45 could indicate a bullish breakthrough, while a slide below support might favor bears. Caution is advised when taking positions. Conclusion SOL faces a significant challenge at the $200 mark in August. Holding this level will be crucial for its future performance. Meanwhile, XRP supporters are hopeful for new highs this month. Both coins are under close watch as investors look for signs of continued momentum.

Known as “Bitcoin Independence Day,” the event reduced the influence of large mining pools and introduced a more scalable path for BTC via the Lightning Network. In 2017, the community was locked in a “block size war.” Some, led by figures like Roger Ver , wanted to expand the block size to support faster transactions and mass adoption. Others pushed back, arguing that such changes would centralize the network by requiring high-storage infrastructure, excluding smaller node operators. If every 1MB block were always full, it would take over 55 years to fill my new HD. Let's raise the block size limit. pic.twitter.com/LfN7zHn0b8 — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) August 4, 2015 Ultimately, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) activated SegWit, enabling off-chain solutions while preserving decentralization. The opposing camp launched Bitcoin Cash, with larger blocks but minimal lasting adoption. Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash: 8 Years On The hard fork created two distinct chains, but their market trajectories tell very different stories. Bitcoin (BTC) Aug 1, 2017: ~$2,718 Aug 1, 2025: ~$115,000 Gain: ~4,200% Market Cap: Over $2.2 trillion Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Aug 1, 2017: ~$550 May 2021 ATH: ~$1,600 2022 Low: ~$90 Aug 1, 2025: ~$552 Market Cap: ~$10.9 billion Despite initial momentum, BCH has largely trailed behind in adoption and price performance. BTC has solidified its role as a store of value, while BCH’s payment utility hasn’t gained meaningful traction globally. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Bearish but Watchful Technically, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC recently broke below a key ascending trendline near $117,000. A series of lower highs and a descending triangle pattern signal weakening momentum. The 4-hour chart shows a bearish engulfing followed by Three Black Crows, reinforcing seller dominance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Current Price: ~$113,600 Key Resistance: $114,942 Supports to Watch: $112,643 → $110,587 → $108,420 RSI: 30.63, nearing oversold but no bullish divergence yet 50-SMA: Sloping down at $117,264 Trade Idea: A failed bounce at $114,900 offers a short setup with stop-loss above $116,000. Conservative targets: $112,600 and $110,600. Bulls need a close above $117,000 with strong volume to shift bias. Conclusion: Eight years after SegWit, BTC continues to thrive as the dominant digital asset—technically resilient and ideologically anchored. This year’s “Independence Day” reminds us that the protocol’s strength lies in community consensus, not just code. Whether it sparks another rally or just reflection, the milestone reinforces BTC’s unique evolution as both a decentralized system and a multi-trillion-dollar asset. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $6.2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first BTC-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $6.2 million in its public presale, with $6,278,761 out of a $21,644,097 target. The token is priced at $0.0115, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

Analysts from Bitwise and Standard Chartered now forecast a move toward $200K–$250K by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, smart money is quietly shifting capital into select altcoins that show promise for breakout growth, including a developing PayFi project that’s gaining real traction. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $200K Is More Than Just Hype Institutional interest is driving the bull case. Standard Chartered confirms the $200K BTC price prediction remains in play, citing sustained ETF inflows and corporate treasury allocations. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan echoes this view, pinning $200K as an attainable target with continued momentum. On-chain signals support this outlook. CryptoQuant data shows exchange supplies thinning to levels not seen since 2015, even as demand continues to grow. That flight to quality is classic for bullish price discovery cycles. Source: TradingView So while BTC price may feel costly near $120K, the structural case for further gains is intact. Top Altcoin Momentum: Why This Token Is On Traders’ Radar As Bitcoin captures the headlines, some traders are rotating exposure into high-upside altcoins. One token stands out: Remittix (RTX). Unlike memecoins, it offers real utility via crypto-to-FIAT payouts across 30+ countries, no central gatekeepers, and audited code. Highlights of the latest surge: Presale raised $17.92 million, with 578 million tokens sold near $0.0895 Mobile wallet beta launching Q3 2025 for fast fiat conversions Supported by a broad $250,000 Remittix Giveaway that draws user growth and awareness Some analysts now see multi-hundred, even thousand percent upside for RTX before a token listing, based on product execution and tight presale supply. Experts Are Watching the Top Altcoins with Potential, Not Just BTC The Bitcoin price prediction remains eagerly eyed. A breakout to $200K could be the catalyst for a broader bull move. Yet while BTC leads, smart capital is already dispersing into altcoins that offer bigger multiple, and better real-world use. Remittix is emerging as a standout.

This article delves into which digital coins are poised for growth based on current trends and market sentiments. Discover the top picks that investors are eyeing this month for stacking and possibly reaping impressive returns. Ethereum Price Moves Signal Short-Term Bullish Momentum Ethereum saw a strong surge over the last month, gaining 53.42%, while a recent week recorded a slight dip of -0.46%. Over the past six months, the coin advanced by 18.48%, indicating overall upward motion. Price behavior was dynamic, oscillating within the reported range, which suggests active market participation and trading opportunities. The current trading range spans from $2737 to $4302 with key levels in focus. The nearest support is positioned at $1774.72 and resistance at $4904. A boost in monthly gains indicates emerging bullish control, yet a modest decline last week, along with a high RSI at 66.17, points to caution. Price action lacks a definitive trend, as bulls push upward gains, but bears exert sporadic pressure. Monitoring support at $1774.72 for bounce opportunities and resistance at $4904 for profit-taking signals could be beneficial. Cardano Market Insights and Trading Strategies Cardano experienced a notable rebound over the past month with prices surging by 34.62%, a contrast to a 9.31% decline in the last week and an overall 18.32% dip over the preceding six months. The recent upward movement indicates a burst of buying interest that temporarily offset the longer-term bearish trend. Price recovery over the short term hints at renewed energy in the market despite recent volatility. The current trading range sees Cardano priced between $0.539 and $0.938, with immediate resistance at $1.14 and further resistance at $1.54, while support is near $0.34. Indicators show mixed signals with negative momentum at -0.173 and RSI around 45.30, suggesting a market without a strong directional bias. The Awesome Oscillator reading of 0.0533 implies neither bulls nor bears are in control. Traders should consider positions on retracements towards support and watch for breakouts above resistance for potential buying opportunities. Celestia Price Trends Amid Shifts and Volatility The past month TIA saw a noticeable burst with a 25.64% increase, contrasting with a challenging half-year performance marked by a 56.73% drop. Weekly movement fell by 7.30% during this volatile phase. Price fluctuations reflected underlying uncertainty, with temporary gains failing to sustain long-term momentum. Historical data shows a coin that has experienced rapid rallies followed by steep declines, highlighting the potential for quick recoveries and the risk of swift downturns. Recent swings suggest a market with reactive sentiment and mixed signals from technical indicators. Current prices trade between $1.25 and $2.20, with immediate support at $0.82 and resistance nearby at $2.72, while a secondary resistance appears at $3.66. The Awesome Oscillator at 0.02, along with slightly negative momentum of -0.51 and an RSI close to 42.72, indicate a market under mild selling pressure even as buyers eye potential entry points at lower levels. The price range creates opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on short-term reversals or breakouts. A trade setup could involve careful entries near support and monitoring the resistance level for any convincing bullish breakout, while the mixed technical picture suggests caution until a clear directional trend emerges. Conclusion ETH remains a strong choice due to its widespread use and constant development. ADA also appears promising with ongoing updates enhancing its capabilities. TIA shows potential, appealing to those looking for fresh opportunities. Each of these coins has unique attributes that cater to different needs and preferences. August's market mood suggests these as favorable options to consider. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

49413336,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=797672,1754128821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49413336.jpeg,Historical Data Predicts Dogecoin Price Crash In August — But There’s A Silver Lining,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/historical-data-dogecoin-price/,"The month of August has historically been very bearish for the Dogecoin price, and with the new month rolling in already, expectations are that the meme coin will follow this established trend. If this holds, then the downtrend that has already plagued Dogecoin at the end of July could only be the beginning, and the meme coin could end up falling into double-digit losses from here. August Could Turn Red For Dogecoin When looking at past performances of the Dogecoin price over the last 11 years, it is no surprise that investors tend to move cautiously during the month of August. So far, a total of 7 out of 11 years have closed in the red, leaving only four years of green closes so far. This performance pushed the median returns to -9.98% with an average of -0.79%, as shown by data on CryptoRank. Related Reading: Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Just Turned Red For The First Time Since May — What This Means While this average is low, looking at the years when August has closed in the red shows a high loss rate. For example, the last three years have seen the Dogecoin price close out at an average of -10%. August 2020 was just coming off the back of the bull market, and eventually fell 9.98%, signaling the end of the bull run. The next year, August 2023, saw even worse headwinds, and the Dogecoin price crashed 17.9% before the month was over. Then in August 2024, another 16.9% crash rocked the meme coin, leading to three consecutive years of red closes so far. Post-Halving Trend Could Save DOGE Price Amid the bearishness of August, there has been one deviation that has held over the years, and that is the altcoin’s performance following a halving year. The month of August following each Bitcoin halving year so far has been incredibly bullish, returning more than 20% gains in the month. Related Reading: XRP Blows Cold: Price Crash To $2.15 Still Possible If Buyers Falter This was the case for 2017 after the 2016 halving year, when the Dogecoin price rallied 20% in the month of August. Then again, in 2021, following the 2020 Bitcoin halving year, the Dogecoin price would go on to rally 34.2%, suggesting that this year could go in the same direction, since 2024 was a Bitcoin halving year. However, in both 2017 and 2021, the month of July had closed deep in the red before the August rally. But in 2025, the month of July has already seen an over 35% rally in the Dogecoin price, marking a significant deviation from the trend. Given this, it is possible that Dogecoin does not follow the post-halving trend. However, sentiment in the crypto market is still very bullish at this level and could drive prices higher. If Ethereum does continue to rally and trigger an altcoin season, then Dogecoin will undoubtedly lead the start of the meme coin rally as the leader in the space.

49413360,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76481,1754128844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Best DeFi Token for Summer Gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Already Up 250% Since Entering Phase 6",https://timestabloid.com/best-defi-token-for-summer-gains-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"As summer heats up, so does the DeFi market—and this year, investors are shifting their focus from risky speculation to structured, yield-focused protocols. The seasonal narrative isn’t just about finding the next moonshot—it’s about locking in passive rewards with smarter, more diversified DeFi models. That’s exactly why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured attention. It’s not just up 250% since early phases—it’s building an income-generating DeFi ecosystem with layers of value that go far beyond typical APY. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t a copy-paste protocol. It’s engineered for layered yield strategies, built around the concept of mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens issued 1:1 when users deposit blue-chip assets or stablecoins into lending pools. But what sets mtTokens apart is their ability to automatically accrue interest, reflecting a user’s growing claim on the underlying pool. That alone aligns with traditional DeFi utility. However, the real game-changer is that these mtTokens can also be staked into dedicated smart contracts, unlocking a second layer of rewards in the form of MUTM tokens. These rewards don’t come from inflation—they come from real protocol activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to buy back MUTM from the open market using revenue it generates, and then distribute those tokens to mtToken stakers. The result is a compound earning structure where users enjoy both interest on their deposits and dividend-like MUTM rewards—built on a revenue-driven, self-sustaining model. For yield hunters who want more than just a flat APY percentage, this dual-reward structure provides a more complete passive income strategy. Backing this ecosystem is an upcoming decentralized stablecoin set to follow a strictly overcollateralized model. The protocol will mint this stablecoin only when a loan is initiated and burn it automatically when it’s repaid. That keeps inflation at bay and ensures the stablecoin supply remains tightly managed—two qualities sorely missing from many past DeFi stablecoin attempts. This structure, combined with Layer-2 deployment for low-cost and high-speed transactions, positions the stablecoin to serve as both a liquidity anchor and a yield-bearing asset. Presale Momentum Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.035. Over $13.7 million has already been raised and more than 14,700 holders have joined. With 7% of the 170 million Phase 6 tokens sold, buyers are already racing to secure their positions before the next price hike. Phase 7 will push the token price to $0.040—a 15% increase that’s guaranteed to reward those who act fast. Security hasn’t been left to chance either. The protocol underwent a comprehensive CertiK audit, combining static code analysis with manual review. The results include a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00. To further reinforce transparency, a $50,000 bug bounty is live to incentivize responsible disclosure. And for the community, a $100,000 giveaway is running—ten lucky winners will walk away with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The performance speaks volumes. One investor who swapped out of Avalanche (AVAX) at $27 during its cool-down and bought into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 2 at $0.015 has already seen a 133% gain. Those who entered in Phase 1 at $0.01 are up a staggering 250%. With the listing price already fixed at $0.06, gains for early holders remain some of the highest in the 2025 presale space. Beyond current numbers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working through a detailed roadmap built around four phases: Initiating, Building, Finalizing, and Delivering. The project plans to roll out key features including its stablecoin, full-scale lending operations, Layer-2 scaling, and expanded staking modules as it progresses through these stages. What started as a presale with real utility baked in is shaping into a long-term ecosystem for sustainable DeFi returns. As other projects burn out in the seasonal hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gearing up for a different kind of summer run—one that rewards users not just once, but continually, through smart contracts, dual-yield strategies, and a fundamentally sound DeFi model. Investors looking for more than just a quick flip should take note—because layered passive income is the new alpha, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is delivering it before most even know what’s coming.

The past few days, though, have gone in the opposite direction, with many altcoins charting double-digit price declines, while BTC plunged to a three-week low of under $113,000. During these turbulent times of uncertainty, perhaps prompted by Trump’s latest tariffs and the movement of US nuclear submarines close to strategic Russian locations, prominent industry names, such as Arthur Hayes, have started to sell off. Here’s which altcoins the BitMEX co-founder sold in the past 24 hours. ETH, ENA, PEPE Being Sold As the data shared by the analytics resource Lookonchain points out, Hayes has used one of his known addresses to dispose of over $8 million worth of ETH, $4.6 million in ENA, and $414,700 worth of the third-largest meme coin by market cap – PEPE. Later, the Maelstrom exec clarified that the reason for his sales is mostly related to Trump’s tariffs , many of which are set to be implemented starting from August 1. He believes BTC and ETH will retrace, as the former would retest the $100,000 resistance, while the latter will head toward $3,000. Y? US Tariff bill coming due in 3q … at least the mrkt believes that after NFP print. No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp. So $BTC tests $100k, $ETH tests $3k. Come see my @WebX_Asia Tokyo keynote Aug 25 for more info. Back to the beach. https://t.co/zuHlwgQKC7 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) August 2, 2025 Hayes is far from the only larger crypto investor turning to a sell-off strategy amid this market uncertainty. Lookonchain identified an unknown whale that had deposited over $90 million worth of ETH to several exchanges within a span of just two days. Not SharpLink, Though While some whales and Hayes are rushing to sell ETH, the second-largest ether holder, SharpLink, has taken the opportunity to increase its impressive stash. SharpLink( @SharpLinkGaming ) spent another 108.57M $USDC to buy $ETH in the past 9 hours and received 14,933 $ETH ($52.56M) 3 hours ago.

Attached to the tweet is an excerpt from a published academic or industry source detailing Ripple’s engagement with central banks and financial institutions between 2013 and 2017. The document confirms that by 2015, several leading central banks and monetary authorities were examining or participating in Ripple’s initiatives, particularly those related to updating domestic payment systems. Among these entities were the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority. The Federal Reserve is explicitly mentioned as having engaged in a collaboration connected to domestic payments updating, and this is presented as a matter of documented fact. Yes, Ripple collaborated with the Federal Reserve to update domestic payments. Documented. pic.twitter.com/HEm4fEpWu6 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 Context of the Collaboration and Industry Dynamics The cited text outlines the broader context of the payment industry’s transformation due to blockchain innovations. It explains that by 2015, centralized infrastructure for cross-border payments, like SWIFT , was increasingly considered outdated. Institutions and regulators began investigating alternatives. In this context, Ripple emerged as a prominent player with blockchain-based solutions to improve payment efficiency. The collaboration between Ripple and the Federal Reserve is presented as part of this shift. Other national authorities, such as the Bank of England and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, also reportedly worked with Ripple on payment modernization efforts. These interactions are noted alongside references to Ripple’s engagement in global conferences and policy forums, including SWIFT’s SIBOS and Money2020, where Ripple executives were featured participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Industry Integration and Capital Backing The text also references Ripple’s broader industry presence, particularly through its venture capital funding. Between 2013 and 2017, Ripple secured $93.6 million across nine funding rounds. Notably, one of these rounds was led by Santander InnoVentures, which is associated with Banco Santander. That bank later implemented Ripple’s technology for retail cross-border payments. This institutional backing further reinforced Ripple’s position as a viable infrastructure provider in the emerging blockchain payments landscape. Ripple’s increasing visibility is also evidenced by its hosting of the annual SWELL conference in 2017. The event featured prominent keynote speakers, including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and former U.S. President Bill Clinton. This signals the company’s rising stature in both financial and policy arenas. The Role of XRP Price Appreciation in Institutional Interest The document also highlights the influence of XRP’s market performance on institutional interest. It states that the rise in XRP’s price in late 2017 helped attract attention from financial institutions. An informant cited in the text remarked that at that time, Ripple’s valuation exceeded that of nearly every bank on the planet, except possibly twenty. This rapid increase in perceived market value reportedly increased inbound interest in Ripple’s solutions. This observation is presented not merely as a speculative opinion but as a noted factor in Ripple’s growing relevance to institutions. The price momentum of XRP during that period coincided with broader industry awareness and likely contributed to Ripple’s ability to initiate or expand collaborations with central banks and other financial authorities.

Ethereum daily active addresses have hit 841,100, the highest since 2022. This metric tracks how many unique addresses are involved in ETH transfers each day and is considered a proxy for user engagement on the network. The spike is a significant departure from the 600,000-range consolidation we’ve seen in recent months. While this is good for user interest, it doesn’t differentiate between buying and selling. Historically, these spikes in address activity precede volatility and this one is no exception—Ethereum’s price has pulled back sharply after the activity surge. Ethereum $ETH daily active addresses surged to 841,100, the highest in a year, just before the recent drop below $3,500. pic.twitter.com/uHIVLcfBbH — Ali (@ali_charts) August 2, 2025 So what does it mean? Increased transactions often mean traders are repositioning themselves, especially before major market events or key technical setups. USDT Trends Show Broader Market Caution Glassnode reports that the 30-day moving average transfer volume of USDT has risen to $52.9 billion, recovering from 2022’s market downturn. But Ethereum’s share of USDT transaction volume has decreased. https://twitter.com/CryptosR_Us/status/1951283799016317415 Currently: Tron leads with $23 billion in USDT volume BNB follows at $14.9 billion Ethereum trails both This drop in stablecoin settlement dominance could mean while Ethereum network activity is up, transactional preference is shifting to lower-fee chains for stablecoin usage—especially with volatile ETH gas prices. ETH/USD Technical Outlook: Short Bias Persists From a price action standpoint, Ethereum price prediction is looking weaker. ETH has broken below $3,548 and failed to hold above the rising trendline that had been in place since mid-July. A bearish engulfing pattern, followed by three large-bodied red candles (like the Three Black Crows), confirms distribution. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key signals: RSI at 28.97: Oversold but no bullish divergence 50-period SMA at $3,745 is resistance Lower highs and lower lows is a descending triangle Support levels to watch: $3,428 (next critical zone) $3,331 and $3,235 (targets on breakdown) Trade Setup: If ETH retests $3,548 and gets rejected (e.g. shooting star), short at $3,548 with stop above $3,600 and targets at $3,428 or lower. More aggressive would be to short at $3,428 with targets at $3,331 and $3,235. Need to get back above $3,651 and the trendline to flip the bias bullish. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $6.2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first BTC-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $6.2 million in its public presale, with $6,278,761 out of a $21,644,097 target. The token is priced at $0.0115, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

This time it’s not through Ripple, but on his own terms. Schwartz says he hasn’t run XRPL infra himself in years, but now plans to deploy a powerful, high-uptime XRPL hub in a NYC datacenter. This comes in when XRPL went on to hit more than 70 million new transactions (3.83 billion in total) over the last 30 days. It recorded 13.5 million transactions in the last week, which knocked 1.8 million daily transactions. Ripple’s native crypto, XRP, has posted a surge of over 30% in the last 30 days. Ripple CTO returns to XRPL infra Schwartz, in a post, mentioned that it will be equipped with an AMD 9950X CPU, 256GB RAM, and high-speed NVMe storage. He added that the server will run on Ubuntu LTE with a 10GB unmetered connection. This aims to act as a reliable public hub with reserved slots for key validators, hubs, and XRPL applications. “I haven’t run any XRPL infrastructure myself in a few years,” Schwartz wrote , noting this will be a personal project. While the server will operate with production-grade reliability, he stressed it shouldn’t be relied upon as a single point of failure in a decentralized ecosystem. I haven’t run any XRPL infrastructure myself in a few years. Looking at the network, it seems like the most useful thing would be a high-quality hub with reserved slots for UNL validators, other hubs, and servers serving applications on XRPL. This would be me personally, not… — David ‘JoelKatz’ Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 2, 2025 Earlier, Schwartz voiced concerns over the stagnation in XRPL usage, despite Ripple working with over 300 banks. He suggested that the core issue is still regulatory uncertainty. Most institutional activity remains off-chain due to compliance hurdles. On the other side, CEO Brad Garlinghouse had revealed that Ripple has applied for a national bank charter in the US. It looks to join Circle in a push to plug crypto infrastructure directly into the financial system. A national charter means Ripple could bypass traditional banks for settlement and cut costs. XRPL DEX, AMM volumes on the rise Ripple recently bagged a partial win in the legal tussle with the US SEC. It has pushed XRP price to surge by around 29% on the year to date (YTD) timeline, outperforming Bitcoin. XRP is trading at an average price of $2.97 at press time. It went on to hit $3.6 in July. A report by Dune highlighted that XRPL has now surpassed 7 million total accounts. More than 1 million new users joined in 2025 alone, while over 3k new accounts were created daily on average. It added that daily signups regularly exceed 20K. 3/ Accounts • XRPL has now surpassed 7M total accounts • 1M+ new users joined in 2025 alone • 3K+ new accounts created daily on average • Daily signups regularly exceed 20K A 13-year-old chain… still onboarding at startup speed. pic.twitter.com/k38kIqNp0b — Dune (@Dune) August 1, 2025 XRPL’s native DEX and AMM layers have been growing fast in the past 30 days. Its DEX volume grew from 384 million to 465 million XRP. Its AMM volume rose from 350 million to 408 million XRP. However, daily DEX traders averaged around 2,363.

Since Thursday, the largest digital asset by market cap has been in a correction mode after a few weeks of consolidation. Notably, bitcoin fell below the southern boundary of its trading range and dropped from $119,000 to its lowest levels since July 10 at $112,700 on Friday evening. Here are some of the possible reasons behind this rather painful retracement, which range from global economic uncertainty to substantial ETH withdrawals. Macro Reasons The overall BTC correction this week began on Wednesday evening, hours after the US Federal Reserve decided to ignore Trump’s pleas for a rate reduction and left them unchanged. Although this decision was entirely expected, even after the positive US GDP report for Q2, which went out the same day, BTC’s price dipped by a few grand. The asset managed to recover some of the losses by Thursday, but the Fed’s refusal to pivot from its policy has to be named as the first possible reason behind BTC’s overall drop. The POTUS’s tariffs are second in line, as many of them took effect starting from August 1 (Friday). Additionally, Trump made some last-minute changes, which included adding new countries to the list and raising the tariffs against certain Canadian goods. The 47th US President made the news once again on Friday evening by ordering two nuclear submarines to be positioned in “the appropriate regions” around strategic Russian locations. This came as a response to a speech by Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian President, about the growing risks of a war between nuclear-armed adversaries. Although this concludes our list of three possible macro reasons behind BTC’s correction, here are some bonuses that might have had a smaller impact. First, India said it will continue to buy oil from Russia despite Trump’s threats. Second, the POTUS claimed that the unfavorable jobs numbers that were announced on Friday were “rigged” by a Biden appointee. BREAKING: President Trump says today’s jobs numbers were rigged to make him and the Republicans look bad. pic.twitter.com/lmLzvNiUEQ — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 1, 2025 Sell-Offs The second portion of our list includes two main sale-off reasons, which the aforementioned global events and uncertainty may have provoked. At first, reports emerged on Friday during the initial phase of this correction that retail investors had begun disposing of large quantities of their bitcoin holdings. Their behavior was mimicked to a large extent by investors using the spot Bitcoin ETFs to get some BTC exposure. The ETFs broke a five-day positive streak on Thursday when $114.8 million left the funds, according to data from Farside. The landscape worsened on Friday as investors pulled out $812.3 million in what became the worst single-day performance since February 25.

The report says that based on the total addressable market (TAM) model, the crypto king could go up by 65% from the current level if Bitcoin captures just 2% of the global liquidity (global M2) and just 5% of gold’s market cap. The TAM model is a tool used to estimate the maximum opportunity available to a product or service, in this case Bitcoin, assuming it is able to capture the entire market. “…if you believe bitcoin is unlikely to compete with the cash positions of Corporate Treasuries or FX Reserves (assigning them 0%) but more likely to take a share of Global M2 (let’s assume 2%) and Gold (5%), the sum of those contributions would estimate a value of US$189,000/BTC.” According to CoinShares, the global liquidity (global M2) is currently at $127.3 trillion, while the total market cap of all the mined gold is $23.9 trillion. The digital asset investment firm further says Bitcoin is “increasingly likely to obtain a higher share of monetary markets” as it becomes a “more useful form of money.” “Bitcoin does not need to replace the global monetary system to be profoundly valuable. Capturing a small share of these enormous markets would be more than enough.” Bitcoin is trading at $114,800 at time of writing.

You get a wild lineup like Degen, Cat in a Dog’s World, Cheems, and one presale that’s got investors purring with excitement. The meme coin wave hasn’t slowed down in 2025—in fact, it’s only getting weirder, louder, and way more profitable. With social momentum replacing spreadsheets and cat gifs outshining candlestick charts, this month’s meme coin lineup isn’t just wild—it’s wallet-worthy. Leading the charge is a mischief-making feline called Trollercat presale is currently in Stage 15 of its headline-grabbing. With more than $425,000 raised, over 1,600 holders, and a price of $0.0001063, this token has already delivered an eye-watering 2024.8% ROI. And guess what? There’s still 399.72% more upside before it hits its final launch price of $0.0005309. Time matters here. Every second wasted lets this cat sneak one step closer to a higher price bracket. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Forget everything you thought a meme coin could be. Trollercat isn’t a copy-paste gimmick riding the trend. It’s a handcrafted mischief engine powered by a legendary meme vault and wrapped in a staking system built to reward patience. The current Stage 15, themed after the infamous “Left Shark” Super Bowl flub, captures what Troller Cat does best—stealing the show in its own bizarre, chaotic way. While the world followed the dance routine, Left Shark flailed and flourished. That’s Troller Cat energy in a nutshell—unpredictable, unforgettable, and undeniably iconic. At this price point ($0.0001063), a hypothetical $10,000 investment could grow to over $49,000 by the time it lists at $0.0005309. That’s not hopium—that’s hard math. Add a referral program that unlocks with a $25 buy-in, giving a 10% bonus to both sender and receiver, and you’ve got a viral growth engine disguised as a meme. With its polished dashboard and explosive presale trajectory, Troller Cat is no longer a hidden gem. It’s a ticking timebomb of opportunity and easily one of the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Month. Thematic 26-Stage Presale Troller Cat’s presale isn’t just a countdown to launch—it’s an entire storyline with each stage paying tribute to a legendary internet prank. From Trojan Horses to Rickrolling to Diogenes trolling emperors, every chapter cements this cat’s place in meme history. Right now, it’s perched at Stage 15, but each of the 26 stages is a star on the Trolling Walk of Fame, giving every buyer a backstage pass to a growing legacy. This isn’t just quirky branding—it’s strategic economics. Every new stage boosts the token price while decreasing supply, forming a natural price ladder that rewards those who act early. Combine that with the Game Center’s ad-powered buyback and burn system, and you’ve got a deflationary setup that ensures each $TCAT becomes scarcer over time. It’s more than just a meme—it’s a machine engineered for long-term value. No other project on this list has fused storytelling with supply control quite like this. 2. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) If you’ve been around crypto long enough to remember when “GOAT” meant more than a meme, you’ll appreciate Goatseus Maximus. This coin mixes ancient Roman satire with internet absurdity, creating a surreal token that worships the ridiculous. Its legion of hodlers behaves more like a toga-wearing cult than a trading group—and that’s entirely intentional. With low supply, anti-whale mechanics, and unique NFT integrations, $GOAT has gone from internet in-joke to mid-cap beast. Community contests, themed raids, and Discord strategy battles keep the meme machine rolling. As it prepares for a new DEX listing and potential staking options, Goatseus Maximus is turning side-eyes into green candles and solidifying itself among the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Month. 3. Degen ($DEGEN) There’s nothing refined about Degen—and that’s the point. It’s a full send into crypto’s chaotic core, where memes are currency and every dip is a dare. With its pixelated branding and “buy or cry” attitude, $DEGEN has attracted a fearless community of traders, gamblers, and meme warriors who thrive on market madness. But behind the trolling lies a surprisingly solid token model. Dynamic supply burns, frequent airdrops, and gamified staking pools give $DEGEN real utility. The devs even introduced “Rage Quit” NFTs that change artwork depending on how badly the market dips. In this space, style matters—but survival matters more. Degen does both and belongs on every list of Best New Meme Coins to Join This Month. 4. Cat in a Dog’s World ($MEW) With the meme market dominated by dogs, MEW walks in, yawns, and knocks the bowl off the table. It’s the underdog of underdogs—or rather, the undercat—and it’s thriving by flipping the trend on its head. MEW blends feline arrogance with smart tokenomics, creating a coin that mocks dog coins while outperforming several of them. Its recent spike came after a viral thread comparing MEW’s chart to a sleeping cat that just woke up. The metaphor stuck—and so did the buyers. With deflationary mechanics, a feisty holder base, and surprise NFT airdrops, MEW is clawing up the rankings and meowing loudly about it. Investors tired of barking up the wrong tree might find their purr-fect fit here. 5. Baby Doge Coin ($BABYDOGE) The baby that launched a thousand tweets is still wagging strong. Baby Doge Coin continues to defy logic, gravity, and market expectations with its hyper-deflationary model and meme magnetism. Originally dismissed as a DOGE clone, it’s now carved out its own lane with charity partnerships, aggressive burns, and layer 2 expansion. With over a million holders and consistent Twitter engagement, BABYDOGE proves that cuteness can be a killer strategy. Its recently upgraded smart contract allows for auto-staking and reflection, turning every hold into a passive income stream. While others chase shiny new projects, Baby Doge just keeps bouncing up the ranks—and into watchlists for the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Month. 6. Mog Coin ($MOG) Mog Coin is the internet’s favorite grumpy cat turned financial asset. Its unbothered branding and anti-hype marketing have made it a magnet for cynical investors who’ve seen too many rug pulls and not enough substance. But don’t let the sarcastic memes fool you—MOG is making serious moves. With a no-tax model, surprise burns, and partnerships with meme culture creators, MOG is one of the few coins that actually feels native to internet humor. It also introduced “Mood Mining,” a feature that rewards users for tweeting or posting with MOG-themed memes. It’s clever. It’s profitable. It’s here to troll and stay. 7. Dogs ($DOGS) If every meme token had a bark, DOGS would be the full kennel. This token pays tribute to all canine coins, from DOGE to FLOKI, by building a metaverse project that features playable characters based on the most iconic breeds. The concept? Run-to-earn. No, really. Players race their digital dog avatars in weekly tournaments, with token prizes and bragging rights up for grabs. DOGS has also launched its own merch line and NFT collar accessories. What started as a parody is rapidly becoming a utility-forward project with paws-on potential. 8. Neiro ($NEIRO) Part meme, part movement, Neiro blends web3 innovation with mysterious branding. Its glitched-out visuals and cryptic whitepaper have made it the target of endless speculation. But the dev team? Silent. That’s the hook. Every update is community-sourced. Every move is voted on via DAO. It’s a slow burn, but one that’s created deep loyalty. With recent liquidity injections and listings on several aggregators, NEIRO is poised to burst into mainstream attention. Blink and you’ll miss it. 9. Cheems ($CHEEMS) Cheems never left—he just rebranded. The iconic meme dog now powers a community-led token that’s funnier, faster, and financially wiser than before. With decentralized governance and meme farming campaigns, CHEEMS lets its community meme-to-earn in ways that are both hilarious and strategic. Its recent DEX staking update allows token holders to earn yield by locking up CHEEMS for “bonk days”—a term for high-volume meme pushes. The sillier it gets, the more it earns. That’s the Cheems effect, and it’s working. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the Best New Meme Coins to Join This Month are Troller Cat, DEGEN, MEW, and Cheems—projects that blend humor, strategy, and serious earning potential. These aren’t just viral coins—they’re momentum machines hiding real opportunity.

According to reports, the CTFC will, through its new Crypto Sprint Initiative, enter a collaboration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to advance crypto regulations. The collaboration between the SEC and CFTC is expected to help the United States’ goal of dominating and leading the global market . In addition, the initiative will also improve regulatory clarity and foster blockchain innovation. This means that the crypto market landscape in the United States is expected to be affected, reaching major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Acting CFTC Chair discusses Crypto Sprint Initiative Reacting to the initiative, Caroline Pham, acting chairman of the CFTC, mentioned that the Crypto Sprint will begin by implementing the recommendations in the report submitted by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets Markets. The report, which was recently released by the group, was designed to fulfill the promises made by United States President Donald Trump, especially about making America “the crypto capital of the world.” In the report , the Working Group, which consists of top officials across federal agencies, outlined new legislative and regulatory proposals targeting every aspect of the crypto industry, ranging from banking and taxation to decentralized finance and stablecoins. The report also defines how Congress, CFTC, IRS, SEC, and other banking regulators are expected to fill legal gaps and keep the United States ahead in the “Golden Age of Crypto.” The Working Group called on Congress to pass legislation that would give the CFTC clear authority to regulate the spot market for digital assets that are not recognized as securities. It also noted that there is a need to embrace DeFi, urging the government to “recognize the potential of integrating such technology into mainstream finance.” In addition, the SEC and CFTC were also urged to iron out the process of approving trading at the federal level. “The CFTC is wasting no time in fulfilling President Trump’s vision to make America the crypto capital of the world,” said Acting Chairman Pham. “We will work closely with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce to achieve Project Crypto. Providing regulatory clarity now and fostering innovation in digital asset markets will deliver on the Administration’s promise to usher in a Golden Age of Crypto.” SEC Chairman wants to improve American innovation Paul Atkins, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, also reacted to the Working Group’s report, noting that a rational regulatory framework for digital assets is the best way to improve American innovation, protect investors from fraud, and keep the capital markets in America above others globally. He took a jab at the previous administration and his predecessor, noting that he is grateful that President Trump has been on it since the beginning. “I look forward to pursuing these priorities alongside Commissioner Hester Peirce, members of my staff, and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. I also appreciate the report’s call for enhanced collaboration between the SEC and the CFTC, as well as with other relevant federal agencies, to ensure that our approach is unified, clear, and consistent,” he added. Since January, the CFTC has held its first-ever Crypto CEO Forum and withdrawn outdated staff advisories. It has also released new guidelines to improve clarity for innovators and entrepreneurs in the United States and the crypto industry. The agency has also held several discussions on a digital asset markets pilot program, participating as an observer in industry tokenization initiatives. The agency also completed a public comment period on 24/7 trading and perpetual derivatives. It added that perpetual derivatives have been live on designated contract markets registered with the CFTC since April, and 24/7 has been live since May.

While market-wide volatility has plunged sentiment in the near term, ETH is still a cornerstone of the digital asset universe. Yet even while it dominates, some newfangled Ethereum tokens are coming into view — and could eventually surpass ETH in utility and adoption. One such token? A low-profile upstart by the name of Remittix (RTX). Why Momentum of Ethereum Won’t Be Enough Ethereum is at $3,570.11, down 5.76%, but remains at a market cap of $430.94 billion and $41.57 billion trading volume with a rise of 16.57%. While the price has dropped, the majority of investors view Ethereum as the best long-term crypto investment due to its smart contract dominance and Layer 2 expansion. However, gas fees remain a major barrier. Even with future upgrades like proto-danksharding, Ethereum’s scalability limitations have pushed users towards low gas fee crypto projects and cross-chain bridges. That is where early-stage tokens come in. Many are taking advantage of Ethereum’s system while offering more application-specific, streamlined use cases — like Remittix, a project aimed at international payments with real-world adoption. The Rise of Early-Stage Ethereum Tokens New tokens on the Ethereum platform are catching up by solving specific issues — particularly payments and DeFi. The more demand for crypto solutions to real-world problems arises, the more projects of this nature thrive. The majority of such tokens add value beyond raw speculation. From staking rewards on cryptocurrency to cross-chain DeFi project integrations, many are designed to be used in reality, not hype. Of the presales going on for cryptocurrencies presently, Remittix is among the most promising next altcoin big 2025 that does something Ethereum can’t direct crypto-to-bank transfers in real-time with live FX conversion. Remittix: Solving Crypto’s Real-World Utility Problem Remittix (RTX) is priced at $0.0876 per token now, having raised over $17.92 million and sold 578 million tokens. Remittix stands out due to its wallet reveal announcement, with a beta launch scheduled for Q3 2025. The wallet will provide direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, real-time FX conversion, and over 40 cryptocurrencies. It’s designed for freelancers, remitters, and businesses — not just traders. Unlike all other projects banking on hype, Remittix offers crypto with real utility from day one.

Why This Could Mark The Ideal Loading Point Of The Year,https://bitzo.com/2025/08/are-pi-and-ton-excessively-discounted-why-this-could-mark-the-ideal-loading-point-of-the-year,"Could the current prices of PI and TON present a significant buying opportunity? The market buzz suggests these cryptocurrencies might be undervalued. This article delves into the potential growth of these digital assets and explores whether now is the perfect time to invest. Uncover the factors that could mark a turning point for PI and TON. Pi Network: Short-Term Dip Amid Long-Term Surge PI recent price analysis shows a one-month decline of approximately 14.74% alongside a smaller weekly drop of 8.16%, indicating some short-term weakness. Over the past six months, the coin experienced impressive growth of around 308.80%, demonstrating strong long-term momentum despite recent setbacks. Periods of rapid appreciation were followed by corrections that brought the trading range to between $0.36 and $0.49. These fluctuations reveal a coin that has seen notable gains over half a year punctuated by short-term pullbacks. Price action over the past month suggests that while sentiment has eased recently, the long-term trend remains attractive for those expecting future rebounds. The current price situation shows trading in a narrow band from $0.36 to $0.49, with the nearest support level at $0.32 and resistance near $0.57. A lower support around $0.19 and a second resistance near $0.70 have been identified. Technical indicators such as a relative strength index at 32.88, along with slightly negative momentum and oscillator readings, point to a bearish short-term bias, indicating visible sell pressure in immediate trading. No clear directional trend has fully emerged, allowing for both defensive buyers near support levels and cautious short sellers near resistance. Traders might consider limited positions with entry points near established bounds while waiting for confirmation of a breakout before increasing exposure. Toncoin Market Overview: Price Trends and Key Levels Toncoin gained 24.24% over the past month, with an 11.06% weekly increase highlighting short-term strength, while a 24.71% decline over six months shows a notable longer-term correction. Price swings have been evident, indicating that the coin has experienced both quick rallies and extended pullbacks. The fluctuating trend points to a volatile market history marked by rapid movements in shorter intervals balanced against a considerable downward adjustment over half a year. Toncoin currently trades between a $2.93 and $3.91 range, with immediate resistance at $4.28 and support around $2.34. The next significant levels to watch are $5.26 on the upside and $1.36 on the downside. Bulls show steady interest, as indicated by an RSI reading of 63.03 and positive momentum. However, the prolonged six-month drop underlines the need for caution. Trading ideas include accumulating on dips toward lower support and considering profit-taking near resistance levels, while watching for a breakout above $4.28 or a breakdown below $2.34 for further signals. Conclusion PI and TON have shown a significant reduction in value. This downturn offers a unique buying opportunity. Current trends and market behavior could signal a beneficial moment for entering or increasing stakes in these coins. Their fundamentals support a potential rebound. For those considering long-term investments, this period could be pivotal. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

She says that if Bitcoin can reach $1 million, then XRP could push all the way to $1,000. Based on reports from the XRP camp, she argues that hitting that mark would turn more everyday investors into millionaires than Bitcoin’s own million‐dollar milestone. Related Reading: XRP ETF Approval Incoming? Analyst Eyes September-October Window XPR’s Potential Millionaires According to Xena’s math, you can pick up 1,000 XRP tokens today for about $2,960, since each token trades at $2.97. If XRP ever climbed to $1,000 per token, that position would be worth $1 million. Compare that with Bitcoin. At its current price of $114,500, the same $2,960 only buys about 0.025 BTC. If Bitcoin then rose to $1 million, that stake would grow to roughly $25,860. And if XRP can reach $1000 it will make much more wealthy people than Bitcoin at $1M. Just my 2 cents. https://t.co/DSDdBta066 — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) July 31, 2025 Reports have disclosed that XRP has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, with about 59 billion in circulation. To reach $1,000 per token, XRP’s market cap would have to swell to around $59 trillion. Bitcoin, by contrast, caps at 21 million coins and needs a market cap near $20 trillion for a $1 million price tag. Today’s entire crypto market sits at just over $2 trillion. That means XRP needs a 300× increase in price while Bitcoin needs about a 9× climb. Investor Interest And Adoption According to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, Bitcoin is seen as a digital safe haven similar to gold, with milestones of $150,000 and $500,000 expected within five years. Based on reports from ARK Invest, CEO Cathie Wood raised her Bitcoin target from $1 million to $1.5 million by 2030, citing growing interest from big institutions. Strategy founder Michael Saylor has even said Bitcoin could hit a mind-boggling $13 million by 2045. Author Robert Kiyosaki expects Bitcoin to reach $1 million by 2035, pointing to rising US debt and financial strain. For his part, Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, has reiterated his forecast that Bitcoin will hit $1 million this year. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Analyst Sees $5 Surge Any Moment – Details Ambitious Targets Even with these bullish forecasts, the path to such highs comes with hurdles. XRP faces legal and regulatory challenges tied to its issuer. It also lacks the broad ETF market that Bitcoin enjoys. Everyday investors may see bigger token counts with XRP, but big gains often come with big risks. Betting on a 300× gain is a very different game than a 9× gain. Whether XRP ever reaches $1,000 remains to be seen. The math may show how more millionaires could emerge if it did. But growth on that scale would require massive adoption and fresh capital. For now, both digital assets have a long way to go before they hit these ambitious targets.

Ripple case and the potential for spot XRP ETFs. The firm explicitly stated: “We expect the SEC to approve spot XRP ETFs this year.” It further added, “We expect the SEC to drop its case against Ripple, clearing the way for the approval of XRP ETFs.” These two projections, combining legal clarity and regulatory approval, have been highlighted as a potential inflection point for XRP adoption and institutional engagement. Capstone Research: “We expect the SEC to approve spot ETFs AND drop the Ripple case this year.” The dismissal of the SEC case would clear the path for XRP ETF approvals. A potential Ripple v. SEC settlement could align with ETF approval timelines. Documentation below.… https://t.co/wAlJHc4AGv pic.twitter.com/JfPE43DPul — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 1, 2025 Capstone’s report outlines that the SEC’s enforcement action against Ripple, centered on claims that the company conducted unregistered securities offerings through institutional sales of XRP, is nearing a critical juncture. The legal battle has been active since late 2020, with a partial ruling from Judge Analisa Torres in July 2023 that distinguished between institutional and retail sales. Ripple was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $125 million . However, the retail sales of XRP were not deemed securities. The case remains unresolved as of now, and Capstone forecasts the SEC may withdraw its appeal, bringing an end to the litigation. Institutional Momentum and Filing Activity Increase Pressure Capstone’s note also references the timeline and context surrounding XRP ETF applications. On October 2, 2024, Bitwise became the first asset manager to file an S-1 registration for a spot XRP ETF. Since then, additional firms, including Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, have followed. The anticipation of SEC approval is based not only on the filing activity but also on the legal clarity expected from the resolution of the Ripple case. SMQKE presented this information alongside comments from other market observers. One X user, Darius Ellis, wrote , “If this plays out, it won’t just be bullish for XRP, it will validate the entire utility-first thesis. Regulatory clarity and ETF access are how real adoption begins. The rails are ready.” His comment suggests that the implications extend beyond XRP, potentially strengthening the broader digital asset sector’s infrastructure for regulatory compliance and institutional utility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Legal Timeline May Align With ETF Approval Window Another X user, Mark Mark, pointed out what he referred to as “key catalysts” that could shape the remainder of the year. Citing former SEC regional director and legal analyst Marc Fagel, he noted that both Ripple and the SEC could agree to dismiss their respective appeals ahead of a scheduled August 15, 2025. This would effectively finalize Judge Torres’s earlier ruling. In that scenario, XRP’s legal status would be settled, removing the primary obstacle that currently prevents ETF approval. The legal clarity could trigger a wave of institutional participation. Ripple has previously revealed over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements with institutional partners. Additionally, its partnership with BNY Mellon for the custody of its RLUSD stablecoin demonstrates further readiness. Mark also referenced prediction markets, where PolyMarket reportedly shows an 86% chance of XRP ETF approval in 2025. Capstone’s assertion that the SEC could simultaneously end its legal pursuit of Ripple and approve XRP ETFs this year aligns with growing speculation that regulatory alignment and market readiness are nearing convergence. With multiple firms already in line for ETF offerings and institutional partnerships already structured, the dismissal of the case would eliminate the primary legal barrier.

Can a playful token outpace long-time leaders? The next moves may surprise. Many watch order books for fresh volume signals. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005 . At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits XRP: The Fast River Ready to Flow in the Next Crypto Season XRP started as an idea by three builders, Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, who wanted money to move as fast as a text. They made 100 billion units and gave most to a company now called Ripple. The coin lives on the XRP Ledger, a public book that anyone can read and use. There is no boss who can freeze or undo a payment. Each move costs just a tiny drop and lands in seconds, no bank needed. That speed and price make XRP feel like digital cash for the globe. Many traders now look for coins that can work in the real world, not just climb on hype. XRP fits that wish. Big names test it as a bridge between dollars, euros, and new tokens, cutting fees that eat into profits. While bitcoin can be slow and ethereum can be pricey, XRP stays quick and cheap even when traffic is high. Supply is also held in escrow, so new coins drip out on a clear time line. If the next market run prizes real use and clear rules, XRP may shine brighter than most rivals. Cardano’s Green Rocket: Why ADA Could Shine This Cycle Cardano is a growing star in the crypto sky. This platform was built for smart contracts, letting people create finance apps, tokens, and games. It runs on Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake system that sips power instead of gulping it. The network has two layers: one moves ADA between users, the other runs code. This split keeps traffic smooth and could reach a million moves each second. Since March 2021, its native tokens make fast and cheap deals even easier. Many traders see ADA as a green rival to Ethereum. Fees stay low, and holders earn extra coins by staking, a draw while bank rates stay flat. After the recent drop, ADA sells for much less than its last peak, yet its user count and money held inside apps keep climbing. If the next price boom lifts Bitcoin and ETH, networks with real use and low energy cost could rise faster. Cardano fits that picture, so picking up a small bag now may look smart for patient buyers. Conclusion XRP and ADA remain solid, yet XYZVerse, first all-sport memecoin, blends sports passion, memes, GameFi, and community power, aiming for 20,000% gains and G.O.A.T status amid the 2025 bull run.

As a fast-rising crypto asset, not only did Bonk's rally propel fresh highs, but it also created a fresh frenzy among traders and investors alike. On everyone's mind now: Can this Solana meme coin keep its winning run going and shatter more records in August? The Rise of Bonk: A Meme to Market Contender Bonk started as a fun, community-driven coin on Solana, which quickly gained traction based on its low fees, fast transactions, and loyal following. However much it rides the meme coin trend associated with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, Bonk differentiates itself by the strength of Solana's growing ecosystem and strong tech. Its price movement has reflected a steep adoption curve. After a July rally powered by new exchange listings and celebrity endorsements, Bonk has recorded a 160% price increase, sending ripples through the crypto space. Expanding Footprint Across Exchanges One of the driving factors for Bonk's recent uptick is its increasing availability. Now listed on more than 33 exchanges, both decentralized and centralized, Bonk is growing increasingly accessible to investors worldwide. This increase in liquidity has helped to cap volatility and strengthen investor trust. Exchange listings are typically prime movers in the crypto space, and Bonk's growing presence is clearly assisting its price to increase. As trading volume picks up, more individuals get into the market, forming a virtuous feedback loop. The Solana Advantage Solana itself is a major boost for Bonk. With its notoriously fast transaction times and low fees, Solana is increasingly the go-to network for developers and crypto initiatives. Such an environment allows meme coins such as Bonk to prosper beyond the constraints of its competition on slower chains. Also, Solana ecosystem growth—across DeFi projects, NFTs, and gaming—adds to the overall optimism. Investors looking into Solana projects prefer to consider Bonk a strong candidate due to its cultural traction and tokenomics that are built for wide distribution. What's Driving the Investor Interest? Investor interest in Bonk is fueled by fundamental in addition to speculative factors. On the fundamental side, the project team and community behind the coin actively encourage partnerships and promotional activities, which create engagement. Speculators, however, are attracted by the wild price movement and potential for high returns. Meme coins have historically been extremely volatile, yet they also afford profit opportunities if timed properly. Despite the positive outlook, potential buyers should be cautious. Meme coins are extremely volatile, prone to hype cycles and social media sentiment. Price corrections following massive rallies are common, and Bonk's hyperbolic growth may have a cooling-off effect. Market observers also cite the necessity of monitoring overall Solana network health and general crypto market trends, which can influence the trajectory of Bonk. Going into August, the majority of analysts anticipate Bonk to continue being a hot spot in Solana's ecosystem. Network upgrades planned for Solana and marketing campaigns for Bonk planned to run continuously are likely to keep the momentum going. If trading volumes are kept constant or increased, Bonk can easily sustain or even outperform the July gains. Volatility, however, demands that investors keep a close watch on major support levels and have risk management strategies in place. Conclusion: Bonk's Momentum Gains Steam Under Solana's Spotlight Bonk's 160% July pump is an unequivocal testament to the meme coin's growing influence and expanding profile within Solana's booming ecosystem. Enjoying the benefits of wide-ranging exchange listings, strong community backing, and friendly network dynamics, Bonk is set for further headline-grabbing activity. While the volatility typical of meme coins remains a risk factor, overall sentiment on Bonk continues to look up as it takes the fancy of crypto traders as well as mainstream investors. August can quite possibly see Bonk reaching new milestones as Solana's meme coin star shines brighter than ever.",News|Memecoins,EN,0,0,SOL|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-02 11:11:06

The breakdown below $3 follows a failed attempt to hold above the $3.50 resistance level, which had capped the asset’s rally in late July. The sharp rejection from this area has flipped the short-term trend bearish, with XRP now eyeing lower support levels. According to analysis by Ali Martinez in an X post on August 2, the next key area to watch is between $2.55 and $2.40, levels that acted as a strong consolidation zone in April and early May. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Now, a sustained drop below this range could open the door for a retest of the $1.90 level, last seen in early April. On the upside, $3 now acts as fresh resistance. To this end, unless bulls can reclaim this level quickly, the path of least resistance remains bearish. It’s worth noting that several factors triggered XRP’s plunge below the $3 mark amid broader bearish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market . In this case, on Friday, markets were rattled by a disappointing U.S. jobs report. Just prior, the White House imposed sweeping global tariffs, unsettling investors. Later in the day, President Donald Trump escalated tensions by ordering nuclear submarines near Russian waters in response to threats from a Russian official, causing risk assets to retreat. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.94, down about 0.13% in the past 24 hours and over 8% on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At its current price, XRP maintains a modest premium over its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.64 and a significant gain over the 200-day SMA of $1.87. This positioning above both key SMAs suggests a sustained bullish trend in both the short and long term. On the other hand, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 50.23, indicating neutral momentum. This suggests that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold at the moment.

BNB/USDT price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the oversold area for now. The indicator’s value has decreased to 29.78 in the past few hours. However, this oversold condition shows a possibility for a rebound as sellers become exhausted. A rebound above the Bollinger Band’s lower limit might renew buying demand.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $753.6 in the past 24 hours. If sellers continue to push the price downward, a strong decline toward $682 might emerge. On the other hand, if buyers defend the immediate support at $748 level strongly, BNB price might see strong buying demand around the dip. As a result, the next target could be $845. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,928.95 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $753.6. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.08 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,928.95 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. Heading into August, BNB is trading at approximately $767.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 11:30:00

Mutuum Finance has already generated more than $13.9 million. Mutuum Finance and Shiba Inu are tipped as cryptos with the biggest wealth-creation potential in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dips as Meme Coin Weakens Shiba Inu is currently trading at approximately $0.0000143, down around 9–16% over the past week, as it erased much of July’s gains amid a broader pullback in meme‑coin sentiment. Open interest has declined by over $100 million, and Shibarium’s TVL has shrunk sharply, suggesting waning trader confidence despite recent large token burns aimed at reducing supply. However, mid-term forecasts show SHIB could explode to hit $0.0001 before the end of the bull run. In the current environment, where speculative meme assets are fading and utility becomes the focus, investor attention is also pivoting toward functional DeFi tokens like Mutuum Finance.

Celestia (TIA) – Which Token Represents The Smarter Investment Move Today?,https://bitzo.com/2025/08/cosmos-atom-vs-celestia-tia-which-token-represents-the-smarter-investment-move-today,"In a rapidly evolving crypto market, discerning the smartest investment choice can be challenging. Cosmos (ATOM) and Celestia (TIA) attract attention with distinct features and growth potentials. This article dives deep into these tokens, examining their strengths and future prospects, to help determine which might offer the most promising returns today. Cosmos Market Review and Trade Levels Amid Price Volatility Cosmos gained 7.05% over the past month but declined nearly 27.88% in the last six months. The price fluctuated between $3.64 and $5.06, highlighting significant volatility in the market. A recent one-week drop of 9.28% added to the mixed outlook. Short-term strength occurred amid long-term challenges, keeping investors cautious. Indicators such as momentum and oscillators revealed uneven sentiment, indicating difficulties in maintaining a stable upward trend despite some positive activity. Cosmos trades near a support level at $3.07 and a resistance level around $5.90, with extended boundaries at $1.66 and $7.31, respectively. Market sentiment is cautious, as seen in the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum indicators showing negative values, while the RSI sits at 38.10. Although bearish pressures remain strong, recent gains suggest some buying interest. Price action lacks a firm trend, allowing for short-term trading opportunities within these levels. Traders may consider entering positions beyond the $5.90 resistance or initiating buys near the $3.07 support, using strict stop-loss strategies. Celestia Price Trends Amid Shifts and Volatility The past month TIA saw a noticeable burst with a 25.64% increase, contrasting with a challenging half-year performance marked by a 56.73% drop. Weekly movement fell by 7.30% during this volatile phase. Price fluctuations reflected underlying uncertainty, with temporary gains failing to sustain long-term momentum. Historical data shows a coin that has experienced rapid rallies followed by steep declines, highlighting the potential for quick recoveries and the risk of swift downturns. Recent swings suggest a market with reactive sentiment and mixed signals from technical indicators. Current prices trade between $1.25 and $2.20, with immediate support at $0.82 and resistance nearby at $2.72, while a secondary resistance appears at $3.66. The Awesome Oscillator at 0.02, along with slightly negative momentum of -0.51 and an RSI close to 42.72, indicate a market under mild selling pressure even as buyers eye potential entry points at lower levels. The price range creates opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on short-term reversals or breakouts. A trade setup could involve careful entries near support and monitoring the resistance level for any convincing bullish breakout, while the mixed technical picture suggests caution until a clear directional trend emerges. Conclusion ATOM offers a strong foundation and a well-established ecosystem. It is supported by a robust team and has a clear development plan. TIA , on the other hand, presents innovative concepts and potential for future growth. However, it is still in its early stages and carries some inherent risks. Both coins have unique strengths. ATOM is a safer bet for those looking for stability and sustained progress. TIA may appeal to those seeking potential high rewards despite initial uncertainties. Making a decision depends on individual investment goals. Both coins offer promising opportunities in their own right. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a tweet accompanied by a chart showing the XRP/USD 4-hour time frame on Bitstamp, CryptoBull stated, “XRP will breakout of this bullish falling wedge and climb towards $4 within the next 2 days!” The chart highlights a falling wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-July, bounded by two descending trend lines converging at a point just beyond August 4. This pattern typically implies a potential reversal to the upside, and CryptoBull is projecting a sharp move that could take XRP up to the $4 level. At the time the chart was posted, XRP was trading near $2.99, with the candle formation remaining within the confines of the wedge. The price action has continued to compress as it approaches the apex of the pattern. #XRP will breakout of this bullish falling wedge and climb towards $4 within the next 2 days! pic.twitter.com/rTQwXQD5d1 — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) August 1, 2025 Price and volume have declined, consistent with the formation of a falling wedge. Historical market behavior suggests that such setups often lead to a breakout, especially when met with increased volume near the wedge’s end. The chart’s structure visually reinforces the forecast, with both the lower and upper trend lines containing the price action, while converging toward early August. If the projected breakout occurs as indicated, the move to $4 would represent a roughly 33% increase from the current levels. XRP Community Weighs in with Varying Outlooks Other market participants responded to CryptoBull’s analysis with varying interpretations and expectations regarding timing and volatility. X user Adam Johnson commented , “Timescales are always dangerous, but I like the optimism!! I won’t hold you to it, kudos if you’re right and if not I’m sure it’s coming in the relatively short term.” His message conveyed cautious optimism. It highlights the difficulty in predicting precise breakout timing, while also expressing general agreement with the direction of the forecast. Another commenter, Mary Star, also provided her view, writing , “I think it could be something more like 3-5 days with the possibility of dropping as low as mid to high 2.70s first, but I’m pretty new to this so don’t trust what I say lol.” Her remarks suggested a slightly more conservative outlook, expecting a dip before a sustained upward move. Although she expressed less confidence in her prediction, her assessment still pointed toward eventual bullish momentum aligning with the structure highlighted by CryptoBull. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Key Price Levels and Chart Dynamics The price levels shown on the chart include horizontal lines marking significant ranges, particularly around the $3.00 zone, which currently serves as a key pivot area. The lower boundary of the wedge appears to provide structural support slightly above $2.80. A brief wick below this level is visible around July 24, but the price quickly rebounded back inside the wedge. On the upside, the declining resistance line has capped recent price attempts to rise, forming a tight range now nearing a breakout point. Volume bars below the candlesticks indicate waning trade activity during consolidation, a common feature before potential high-volatility moves. The 200-day moving average line is also visible but remains beneath the wedge, reinforcing the current consolidation as taking place above longer-term support. XRP Market Context and Near-Term Implications CryptoBull’s forecast comes at a time when XRP has shown resilience in holding above key support areas despite broader market fluctuations. The proposed $4 target , if achieved, would bring XRP closer to levels last observed during bull market cycles. The two-day time frame suggested by CryptoBull introduces a short-term trading hypothesis rather than a long-term investment thesis. While the final direction of the move remains contingent on confirmation from price and volume action, the falling wedge structure shown on the 4-hour chart meets established technical criteria for a bullish continuation pattern.

While August passes, DeFi activity on Solana has dropped off a precipice and SOL price retreated from all-time highs and investors find themselves wondering: will the bounce be imminent, or is Solana running out of magic? Euphoria to Caution: The July Explosion Solana's July speed was impossible to ignore. Investor, developer, and big DeFi protocol enthusiasm propelled the blockchain to new highs above $200, outperforming much of the crypto space. Volumes detonated and projects on Solana experienced record popularity, with many funds and platforms ringing in the ”Solana Summer” as the narrative of the year in 2025. But weeks later, the story has turned. SOL retreated hard to around $180 as a sequence of signs began to show that the rally had cooked. Daily active addresses started to drop, and Solana's DeFi total value locked (TVL) fell, pointing to waning risk appetite in the midst of more general market conservatism. DeFi Activity Solana's hypergrowth has always been followed by its active DeFi ecosystem. Decentralized lending, trading, and staking protocols made Solana a speedy, more affordable substitute for Ethereum. Recent data, however, show users taking a temporary pause: TVL is down, and deposit and borrowing volumes have thinned. Experts attribute this slump to several reasons. First, investors are dumping after gains in July. Second, the overall crypto market—still nervous after months of uncertainty—is pulling funds into more established blockchains and stablecoins. Solana's lightning-fast updates, while a core feature, have at times been accompanied by intermittent network congestion, which has made traders and developers momentarily doubt their investments. Technical Support and the Road Ahead Technically, Solana is currently trading above a major support level of $178. Most observers regard this area as important: if SOL holds firm here, then a bounce may be in the cards. In the meantime, future network upgrades scheduled for later in August promise higher throughput and stability, capabilities that may bring developers and users back to the platform. Institutional demand is a silver lining. Several funds that track blockchain performance have registered net inflows into Solana products even as speculation cooled. And several projects are taking advantage of this quieter time to roll out upgrades, roll out new DeFi protocols, and prepare for the next phase of adoption. One feature setting Solana apart is a large and passionate developer community. While on-chain activity drops, hackathons continue to draw new teams, and Solana NFT projects remain surprisingly resilient. The ecosystem's ability to rally when things are tough is seen by many as proof that Solana possesses longer-term upside beyond recent price action. Bull or Bear in August? So will Solana bounce back? Decision pending. Traders are monitoring $178 as the turning point; a decisive break above there might enable another rebound, while a drop below it could hasten the slide. Ultimately, Solana's fate may rest on both its technical performance in the next few weeks and broader trends across the crypto cosmos. After a few moments of euphoria, Solana receives its first serious test of the summer. As DeFi usage tapers and price momentum fades, peril and possibility loom. With technical advancements on the horizon and an engaged ecosystem that continues to improve, investors have basis for bullish caution. Whether Solana reverts to its torrid path—or continues to consolidate—will be made known as August unfolds.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-02 11:30:54

With the project breaking new ground as it combines blockchain, AI, and privacy-based identity verification, enthusiasts and investors alike are asking: is a price surge of WLD on the horizon? A New Era: Worldcoin's Vision for Global ID Launched with a vision of creating an inclusive, decentralized identity system for all the people of the world, Worldcoin is not only in the news due to its technical courage but also due to its scale. In a year and a few months, the initiative has more than 3.5 million signups on six continents driven by its biometric ”Orb” scanners that capture the iris of a person to create secure, individual digital identities. Worldcoin's approach is spectacularly different from that of nearly all competitors. Instead of employing traditional, universally exclusionary documents, its platform utilizes biometric and AI technology to enable everyone—nationals and non-nationals, documented and undocumented alike—to prove they are human when online. The innovation addresses everything from voter fraud to spam bots and paves the way to new opportunities in decentralized finance and social interaction. Biometric & AI Innovations Powering Adoption Worldcoin's exponential growth has been driven by high-profile pilot drops. In 2025, the project rolled out mass deployments of its Orb devices in major metropolitan areas and emerging markets, often partnering with government organizations and NGOs to drive inclusion and access to digital. Latest versions now include strong AI-powered privacy protection, storing user data safely encrypted and anonymized—a top priority with regulatory attention to biometrics gaining speed. The AI layer shatters the tech buzzword barrier: Worldcoin's algorithms allow for fraud detection, reduce duplicate sign-ups, and monitor exploitation, without ever sacrificing privacy. Analysts note that this marriage of advanced biometrics and on-chain authentication could be a standard for the next generation of crypto-based identity projects. WLD Token: A Breakout Waiting to Happen At the heart of the Worldcoin ecosystem is the WLD token, distributed as a reward to verified users and used in an increasing number of dApps and community governance mechanisms. Priced attractively under its 2024 highs, WLD has remained resilient in the face of bearish crypto markets. Recent spikes in new registrations and excitement over expansion into new geographies have some predicting a bullish flip, however. Technical signals indicate WLD could be entering into an ”accumulation phase” as long-term investors build on their positions. If milestones of adoption keep coming and the global discussion around identity and AI gets hotter, a price spike follows as retail and institutional investors alike look for a piece of the action. Navigating Privacy, Regulation, and Hype Of course, Worldcoin's rapid expansion is accompanied by controversy. There have been allegations of centralization, abuse of biometric information, and danger from using such technology in unregulated markets. To counter these issues, Worldcoin has put significant effort into open-source security audits, external monitoring, and user consent infrastructure to meet new privacy needs. Most notably, the project's willingness to engage with regulators and open governance seeking marks it out, especially within an increasingly doubting regulatory climate of digital ID issuers. Conclusion Worldcoin is betting everything on a borderless, bureaucracy-free, all-digital future where anyone can prove ownership of a single, unique digital identity. Backed by cutting-edge AI and biometrics, it's spearheading a global revolution. While WLD speculation builds in anticipation of the next rally, all eyes are on user growth and breakthrough technology launches in the weeks ahead. For those watching the confluence of AI, blockchain, and privacy, Worldcoin is something to watch for—both for the vision and for bringing on the next crypto boom.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,WLD|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-02 11:41:10

In the firm’s Q3 2025 Trader Client Sentiment Report, Charles Schwab reveals that 57% of its clients are bullish in the stock market for this quarter, with only 29% having a bearish bias. The survey also shows that 53% of respondents plan to invest in individual stocks this quarter, as 42% say they intend to add more funds to their portfolio. Only 19% plan to take money out of their investment account. As Charles Schwab traders express their market sentiment over the next few months, 62% say they are most bullish on artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, 56% say growth stocks are their top pick and 55% say they see the most upside potential in domestic stocks. Meanwhile, 55% say they are bullish on the equities market in general. Source: Charles Schwab The survey results come as banking giant Goldman Sachs unveils a trade it says could spark an investor stampede driven by fear of missing out (FOMO). In a new podcast episode, Kunal Shah, the co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International, says that a Fed rate cut will negatively impact the value of the US dollar and trigger rallies in European stocks, fueled by cheap dollars and a rising euro. 4:50 “I think from here. One of the key drivers beyond the long-term capital allocation theme is really just relative monetary policy. We’re at the point now where the ECB (European Central Bank) may be done [cutting rates], at least for now. But there is pressure on the Fed to cut. Now you need to figure out when they are getting a green light from a data perspective, but there is definitely room there for further easing in the front end of the US curve, and that can catalyze another move higher in the euro. And when the euro is rallying, it is the ultimate FOMO trade that I think people now are going to have to re-risk into.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Most Wall Street analysts were impressed by the company’s ad business, seeing that AI-based advertising and rising user numbers largely drove its revenue growth. The announcement boosted investor confidence in the company’s AI-powered ad tools and strong user engagement. Ads generated $465 million—accounting for 93% of total revenue. Reddit’s daily active user count grows despite Google traffic The company saw an 84% jump in ad revenue and a 21% increase in daily active users to 110.4 million, boosted by international growth and AI-driven search , which now generate 70 million weekly queries. Analysts claim its rising daily active user builds investor confidence in the platform’s “long-term growth narrative”. Analysts at Piper Sandler even noted that while fluctuating Google traffic was a challenge in Q2, Reddit’s US daily active user count grew, showing the platform’s distinctive content holds value for both Google and its users. The firm also reported a 24% annual increase in alternative revenue streams, like its data licensing business, totaling $35 million. The discussion forum has been intensifying its focus on AI-enhanced ads. It uses its community-sourced data to power tools like Reddit Insights and Conversation Summary Add-ons, which are featured in the new Community Intelligence suite and help brands mine discussions for marketing value. The firm’s acquisition of Memorable AI in 2024 also strengthens its positioning as an ad-tech player. The company has projected that its Q3 revenue will range from $535 million to $545 million, topping the average analyst estimate of $473 million, per LSEG figures. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, acknowledged that Reddit’s decoding of user intent through real community interactions could open up more monetization prospects, hinting that the firm could reach its target. He further commented, “Being able to home in on exactly the kind of consumer who might be open to splurging on what a seller offers has made sites like Reddit hugely popular with advertisers.” Reddit plans on expanding its conversational AI tool Though still recent, Reddit’s content licensing deals with Google and OpenAI have already generated a stable revenue stream in the second quarter, hinting at meaningful long-term value. Since launching in December, Reddit Answers—a conversational AI tool—has also experienced strong user growth, increasing from 1 million to 6 million weekly users over the past quarter. According to CEO Steve Huffman’s message to shareholders, Reddit is focused on weaving the tool further into its search framework to position search as a core component of the platform. He added that the company could grow to a search hub, offering a special kind of knowledge and conversation breadth that cannot be found on other platforms. Reddit Answers is already deployed in 12 countries and is eyeing global expansion. The company eventually plans to merge it with core search functionality and make the search bar more visible in the app’s design. So far, the company is valued well above its peers, trading at 74.57 times its estimated earnings for the next year, compared to 19.39 for Pinterest and 27.54 for Snap.

The development is not just a milestone for Ripple (XRP) but also a watershed transformation in how major financial institutions are adopting digital assets and stablecoins as legitimate payment instruments. A New Era in Bank & Blockchain Collaboration The partnership between Ripple and Bank of America, initially highlighted for its pioneering blockchain-based cross-border payment networks, has evolved into a broader collaboration to simplify financial workflows internally. The implementation of RLUSD (Ripple's USD-backed stablecoin) at Bank of America is designed to optimize liquidity management, reduce transaction costs, and accelerate settlement times This innovation reflects an enormous step towards mainstream stablecoin acceptance beyond speculative trading—highlighting their use as stable, efficient instruments for corporate finance transactions in the real world. What is RLUSD and Why It Matters The RLUSD stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is the brainchild of Ripple's vision to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) networks. Stablecoins, in contrast to volatile cryptocurrencies, possess stable value and are ideal for payments, remittances, and settlements in both fiat and crypto markets. Bank of America can leverage RLUSD to achieve the transparency and immutability of blockchain with currency stability—a fantastic blend of innovation and stability. Benefits to Ripple and Bank of America The collaboration has numerous advantages: Blockchain enables near real-time payment finality, eliminating delays associated with traditional banking hours or intermediaries Reduced reliance on correspondent banks and clearinghouses lowers the transaction cost. Every transaction on Ripple's ledger is traceable, auditable, and immutable, enhancing trust and compliance. RLUSD facilitates the seamless movement of dollar-equivalent capital around the globe, optimizing capital allocation. For Ripple, Bank of America's support is a prominent endorsement for RLUSD and accelerates institutional uptake—which is central to Ripple's long-term growth prospects. Broader Ramifications for the Banking Sector Bank of America's embrace of a stablecoin solution reflects a larger trend: major financial institutions are speeding up the implementation of crypto-native solutions in order to remain competitive and keep up with increasing customer demand for speed and low costs. Stablecoins, once on the fringe of assets, are now being seriously considered as important tools in the global payment arena. This collaboration may push other banks to advance their digital asset agendas, initiating a virtuous cycle of innovation and pressure on regulators to develop more concrete frameworks. Despite the enthusiasm, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainties around stablecoins and digital asset custody continue to pose risks. Bank of America and Ripple will need to navigate evolving compliance landscapes to ensure RLUSD's adoption remains frictionless and compliant. Public skepticism about data privacy and security on blockchain networks necessitates ongoing transparency and education. Maintaining a robust security posture and proactive regulatory engagement will be paramount as this partnership scales. Conclusion Bank of America's decision to incorporate Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin into its internal payments infrastructure is a breakthrough for both entities and the financial sector in general. It reflects the slow but relentless embrace of blockchain innovation by mainstream institutions. As RLUSD sets a new standard for speed, transparency, and cost-efficiency in payments, Ripple solidifies its role as a key player at the nexus of finance and technology. Both for the crypto space and traditional banking, this partnership offers a glimpse into the future of money movement—fast, seamless, and on the back of the power of blockchain. The weeks and months to come will determine how far this partnership can impact the evolving face of digital finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|WALLET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-02 11:55:03

Analysts highlight previous resistance turning support as traders await a bounce or further downside. Grayscale tracking sparks institutional interest as BONK holds near critical support amid heavy trading. BONK Teeters Before Potential Breakout Bonk (BONK) trades below $0.000026 after falling 8% in the past 24 hours and 27% over the last week. Trading volume reached $570 million in the same period. Market attention is on a key support zone that could determine the next move. Crypto analyst Jonathan Carter said BONK is retesting its neckline at $0.000025, forming what he identified as a cup-and-handle pattern, which is often seen during bullish continuation phases. Carter said, “pattern completion combined with a neckline hold could result in 100% upside.” His price targets are $0.000035, $0.000037, $0.000041, and $0.000052. He noted that trading volume increased on the right side of the pattern, which can confirm market interest during a potential breakout. #BONK Neckline Retest – Bulls Ready to Bounce Cup and handle pattern executing flawlessly near the $0.000025 support zone‍ Pattern completion + neckline hold = 100% upside Target levels: $0.000035 → $0.000037 → $0.000041 → $0.000052 This is the setup that doubles… pic.twitter.com/Lb98rWSjDZ — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) August 1, 2025 Interestingly, technical readings show the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has cooled from earlier highs, giving room for another upward move if buying returns. Buyers Watch Previous Resistance as Support Analyst BATMAN shared that BONK’s recent pullback is approaching a previous resistance area, now a potential support zone between $0.000025 and $0.000026. “If it dips a bit lower into that blue box, that’s the spot I’d be looking to buy,” he said. A recovery from this zone could keep the bullish setup intact. A break below the area, however, would suggest fading short-term strength. Institutional Tracking Adds Interest Last month, BONK was added to Grayscale’s institutional tracking list. While this does not confirm investment, traders see it as a step that may bring broader market visibility. Market participants are now focused on whether BONK can hold its neckline support and trigger the next leg of the cup-and-handle pattern or if the decline continues in the near term.

With that said, however, as the market hovers towards utility-focused projects, a new contender is slowly gaining traction in the background — Remittix (RTX) . BNB Eyes $1,000 Despite Market Volatility Binance Coin is at $761.23, having fallen by a 5.52% decrease within the last 24 hours. The decline notwithstanding, the market capitalization of BNB is now valued at $106.05 billion, while trading volume is up by 17.14%, which shows that demand for the asset never subsides. BNB is also instrumental in the Binance ecosystem, from discounts on trading fees to token offers through Binance Launchpad. With centralized exchanges still being main entry points for most investors, the utility of BNB presents longer-term potential — particularly with the expansion plans of Binance across the world. All that notwithstanding, competition is coming from outside the traditional CEX network. As cross-chain DeFi projects and decentralized exchange platforms become more mainstream, utility tokens with a clear use case are starting to pick up speed. Utility Is Driving the Next Wave of Crypto Projects With investors in search of the best long term crypto investment, fundamentals are again under the spotlight. Tokens providing crypto with actual utility, as opposed to hype, are performing better. That includes categories such as crypto staking, low gas fee crypto, and blockchain payment solutions. This trend has ignited demand for early stage crypto investments — especially those that bring real-world solutions to fruition. Low cap crypto gems are being noticed, particularly those that allow for easy global transactions and fiat incorporation. One project that is simply accomplishing this is now entering the spotlight quietly but confidently: Remittix (RTX) . Remittix: A Real-World Payment Solution Rising Quickly Remittix (RTX) is making waves as a DeFi project built for actual use — not speculation. At $0.0895, the token has already amassed more than $17.92 million, with more than 578 million RTX tokens sold at its presale. Remittix closes the distance between crypto and traditional finance by allowing users to send digital currencies like BTC, ETH, and XRP to bank accounts in over 30 countries directly. This differentiates it from other future crypto endeavors and positions it at the top of the next big altcoin 2025. A milestone in recent news — the Remittix wallet beta launch, scheduled for Q3 2025. The mobile-focused wallet will feature real-time FX conversion, 40+ cryptos, and 30+ fiat currency support, for a seamless user experience even for the first-time crypto user.

While Hedera sees a jump following its Robinhood listing and Chainlink shows momentum on the charts, Cold Wallet is already proving its case. Despite still being in presale, Cold Wallet has snapped up Plus Wallet for $270 million and launched a live product that actively rewards its users. It’s not waiting on future milestones; it’s building now. That kind of execution is rare and may be what sets it apart as a best crypto platform pick. $270M Acquisition Shows Cold Wallet Isn’t Just Another Presale Project Cold Wallet just made a bold move, spending $270 million to acquire Plus Wallet. For a presale project, that’s practically unheard of. While many raise funds and then stall, Cold Wallet is accelerating. Plus Wallet brings over 2 million users, and the deal comes just seven months into Cold Wallet’s journey. That’s not theory, it’s action. And it builds a real foundation. Cold Wallet has already raised $5.4 million in its presale and is in stage 16, with tokens priced at just $0.00942. The launch price? A confirmed $0.3517. That’s a 3,700% difference. On top of that, Cold Wallet already secured the ColdWallet.com domain for $2 million. Now with a live, cashback-driven wallet, the product is out there and working. Users are getting USDT through referrals, and upcoming features include gasless rewards and Layer 2 upgrades. This isn’t some distant roadmap. It’s a functioning system, delivering today. With many crypto projects still stuck in planning mode, Cold Wallet is showing that execution matters, and that’s what investors backing a presale want to see. Hedera’s Price Spike Highlights the Power of Accessibility Hedera’s recent uptick is another sign that real access drives real growth. Its Robinhood debut led to a 12% daily rise, bringing the price near $0.28. But this wasn’t just a short-term pump; it followed a 556% weekly jump as more users could finally buy in. Trading volume also backed it up, jumping to over $500 million. And with no major ecosystem updates, the move was all about availability and exposure. Hedera also climbed above its 50-day SMA, and the RSI remains positive, showing that this run is more than just buzz. It’s supported by data and demand, and that’s a solid combination. Chainlink Moves Past $18.80, With $22 in Sight Chainlink has cleared the $18.80 mark, and that breakout looks strong. The price rise is backed by news of institutional use through Project Acacia, and the token is holding firm above key moving averages. The RSI is around 67, strong, but not overheated. That leaves room for more upside, and analysts now point to $22 as the next goal. If momentum continues, some even eye $28 as a potential top. Importantly, the volume follows the price. This isn’t a thin rally. Multiple exchanges are showing higher trading activity, which supports the strength of the move. Chainlink’s value as a utility token is showing through here. Bottom Line It’s easy to talk about what’s next, but progress is about what’s already happening. Hedera gained traction through better access. Chainlink confirmed its strength through chart action. But Cold Wallet? It’s already making moves that most projects haven’t even planned. A $270 million acquisition during presale. A live wallet that pays users back. A functioning ecosystem is already a rewarding activity. These aren’t promises, they’re milestones. If you’re exploring presales with actual follow-through, Cold Wallet deserves a close look. While others float potential, Cold Wallet is already producing results. That makes it a strong contender for the best crypto platform in today’s market.

The analyst further remarked that ETH is playing a smarter game than Bitcoin right now. While BTC has made lower lows, Corvinus claimed that ETH has held strong with higher lows. The analyst declared that this is not just price action but strength under pressure. The crypto analyst then highlighted what is unfolding for the Ethereum price. He noted that bearish volume has been fading since last month, which indicates that weak hands are drying out. Furthermore, Corvinus revealed that the Hidden Bullish Divergence RSI made a lower low while the price made a higher low. The analyst declared that this is a classic signal of a strong continuation setup. Meanwhile, Corvinus stated that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is oversold, but still, the Ethereum price managed to hold above July’s support on two retests. The analyst believes that this isn’t a coincidence, which is why he is confident that ETH will still rally higher. He explained that ETH isn’t reversing but consolidating at the top, a pattern which often ends in a breakout to the upside. In line with this, the crypto analyst declared that the Ethereum price crash is not the end of the move but simply the calm before the next storm. He added that eyes on ETH continuation look inevitable and that his target of between $7,000 and $8,000 this cycle is still on track. According to Corvinus, the breakout isn’t a question of if but a question of when. ETH To At Least Retest $3,000 Before Next Leg Up In an X post, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes suggested that the Ethereum price might still crash to the psychological $3,000 level before the next leg up. The crypto founder alluded to the Trump tariffs and weak US job data as the reason for this conviction. Hayes also remarked that no major economy is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal GDP. As such, he doesn’t see where liquidity will come from to spark a rally for the Ethereum price or other crypto prices. The BitMEX co-founder also expects the Bitcoin price to retest the psychological $100,000 level.

This Formation Will Send Us Back to New ATH,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-stay-steady-and-strong-this-formation-will-send-us-back-to-new-ath/,"In a recent post on X, respected crypto chartist Egrag Crypto reaffirmed that XRP’s macro bullish structure remains firmly intact , with clearly defined upside targets. However, the next key step lies in micro confirmation: XRP needs a daily close above $3.12 to signal that the recent low is firmly in place. Until that happens, a pullback to $2.65 is still on the table. Egrag emphasized that holding $2.65 as support within the current rigid formation could reignite momentum toward a new all-time high (ATH). But if XRP breaks below that level on the mid-time frame (MTF), the bullish setup could unravel. “Break it on MTF,” he warned, “and we are Fooked.” Current Price Action: XRP at a Crossroads As of report time, XRP is trading around $2.94, with intraday movement between $2.91 and $3.05. Despite recent bullish attempts, XRP has yet to post a confirmed daily close above $3.12, leaving the outlook at a critical juncture. #XRP – Macro View with Micro close: The macro view and formation is still intact and the potential targets are super clear. Now the micro closure is needed above $3.12 on daily time frame to confirm the low was in. Other than that $2.65 is still in the cards. Holding it as… pic.twitter.com/N8K0cqggz5 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 2, 2025 Following a strong rally from $2.23 in early July to a local high of $3.55 on July 22, XRP has pulled back and is now hovering just below the key micro-confirmation level . This makes the $3.12 threshold the immediate technical battleground, while $2.65 remains the critical downside marker. Structural Outlook: Macro Strength, Micro Uncertainty According to Egrag’s analysis, XRP continues to form a macro bullish pattern, possibly a symmetrical triangle or a rising wedge, stretching back several months. The upper breakout level lies in the $3.12–$3.20 range, and a daily close above this zone would confirm that the recent dip was a higher low, setting the stage for another leg upward. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If XRP achieves that breakout, it could quickly revisit the $3.60–$3.65 region , with a real possibility of pushing into new ATH territory. However, should the price falter and fall below $2.65 on the mid-time frame, the bullish thesis would be invalidated, opening the door to deeper consolidation or correction. What’s Next for XRP? The next few daily closes are critical. A confirmed close above $3.12 would validate Egrag’s bullish outlook and signal that the market is ready to advance toward new highs. Until then, traders and investors should monitor $2.65 closely. This level now serves as the line in the sand for maintaining macro integrity. Egrag’s message to the XRP community is both technical and motivational: “XRPFamily, stay steady and strong. Together we rise, and soon we shall fly so high.” For now, the structure holds. But as always in crypto, confirmation is everything. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The push comes with less than two months to go before federal money runs out on September 30. Even though these three bills alone won’t prevent a shutdown, they give the chamber a stronger position heading into talks with the House and the White House . In a lopsided 87-9 vote, the Senate cleared two bills: one to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs and military construction, and another for the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. Senators then voted 81-15 to pass a separate third bill to cover spending for the Legislative Branch. All three are now heading to the House as a bundled package. Senate lawmakers fight over amendments, funding clawbacks, and VA staffing Altogether, the bills will direct $154 billion to military and veterans programs and more than $27 billion to the Agriculture Department and the FDA, both amounts representing about a 2% boost from current funding levels. Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, said during the debate, “It’s taken a great deal of work, good faith and negotiation to get to this point. Congress has a responsibility, a constitutional responsibility under Article I, for the power of the purse. We are executing that responsibility.” Still, the legislative process wasn’t smooth. Senators clashed over proposed changes to the package. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon who sits on the Appropriations Committee, offered an amendment that would have blocked the White House from using rescission powers to claw back any of the funds. Merkley said Democrats were worried that Trump’s administration would submit another rescissions request before the fall deadline, derailing any broader funding deal. His amendment was rejected. Appropriations Committee ranking Democrat Patty Murray of Washington defended the agreement that was reached in the chamber. She said the bill “rejects damaging cuts from Trump and House Republicans.” Another amendment, offered by Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Alex Padilla of California, was adopted without a recorded vote. It bars the use of any funds to reduce services offered by the Veterans Crisis Line. That’s one of the few amendments that made it through. Other proposals were blocked, including a Democratic amendment that would’ve forced the VA to issue a report on staffing cuts, and another to halt the reorganization of the Agriculture Department. Republicans tried to chip away at the Agriculture-FDA funding too. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Rick Scott of Florida both proposed deeper cuts to that section. Their amendments didn’t survive. Congressional funding bill passes separately after Kennedy’s demand The Legislative Branch bill had its own drama. It only came to a vote after John Kennedy, who’d previously slammed the $7.1 billion price tag, demanded the ability to oppose it separately. “I think we need to set an example,” Kennedy said on the floor before the vote. Though the bill passed, his no vote was logged. Once approved, the Legislative Branch bill was added to the previous two and sent over to the House in one batch, part of the deal Collins outlined earlier in the day. The votes marked a sharp turnaround from Thursday night, when things nearly fell apart. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, had blocked a four-bill package that included funding for the Justice and Commerce departments. Van Hollen was furious that the Trump administration had backed out of a years-long plan to move the FBI’s headquarters to Maryland, killing bipartisan talks on the DOJ budget. Because of that, the Justice-Commerce funding debate was kicked until after the Senate returns from its August recess. With the September 30 deadline approaching fast, pressure is building. The three spending bills passed Friday won’t be enough to keep the government open. Lawmakers are now weighing whether to pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure to extend current funding past October 1. If they don’t act, parts of the federal government could go dark. Some in the House want another long-term stopgap bill. Senate leaders, though, want a handful of full-year funding bills signed by Trump before time runs out. That would guarantee long-term funding for some departments through fiscal 2026, while the rest of the government operates under a short-term extension. Get seen where it counts.

This was a coordinated takedown to flush leveraged longs. Once the market collapsed and those positions were gone, the same hands that sold started pumping the price right back up. The Friday crash didn’t come out of nowhere. The entire crypto market had been sliding for days, and then it buckled. More than $708 million in liquidations hit across the board, most of them long positions. Traders using leverage got wiped out. Ethereum was hit harder than most, dropping from $4,000 to $3,500 in five days. That’s a 10% drop. Traders lose billions as tensions rise At the same time, Bitcoin dropped from nearly $120,000 to $114,000. That 5.6% dip followed a brief recovery attempt after the Fed left interest rates unchanged. But macro pressure didn’t let up. U.S. jobs data came in weaker than expected. And then Mr. Donald Trump told reporters he’d ordered nuclear submarines toward Russian waters. That statement triggered a new round of panic selling. Glassnode analysts warned days earlier that Bitcoin’s rally could collapse under pressure. They said a fall below $110,000 would likely speed up selling, which would usually lead to another surge. That pattern has played out before. During Trump’s first round of tariff announcements, Bitcoin dropped from $100K to $75K. It wasn’t forgotten. The recent downturn has been brutal. More than 160,930 traders lost positions in the crash. That included over $600 million in longs. Bitcoin’s collapse and Ethereum’s faster decline drained around $500 billion from the overall crypto market. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to 55, a noticeable slide from previous highs. ETFs dump Ether after record inflows The selloff didn’t just hit spot traders. After a 20-day streak of inflows, Ethereum ETFs broke their run with a total $152.26 million outflow on Friday. The money pulled out came after weeks of inflows that pushed Ethereum higher. Now the trend has reversed. Grayscale’s ETHE lost the most with $47.68 million in withdrawals. Bitwise’s ETHW followed, bleeding $40.30 million. Fidelity’s FETH posted $6.17 million in outflows. Only BlackRock’s ETHA saw no movement, staying flat with $10.71 billion in total assets. Combined trading volume across all Ethereum ETFs hit $2.26 billion for the day. Grayscale led again with $288.96 million in trades. That volatility lines up with the broader crypto market chaos. Just days before, on July 16, Ethereum ETFs saw their highest daily inflow ever, $726.74 million. On July 17, another $602.02 million came in. Those back-to-back records pointed to massive demand. But Friday’s flip shows how fast momentum can vanish. While retail got crushed, institutions are still buying. Standard Chartered reported that corporations have been acquiring Ethereum at twice the rate of Bitcoin. Since June, crypto treasuries picked up 1% of the total ETH supply. Geoff Kendrick, Head of FX Research at the bank, said the buildup, along with the ETF inflows, was a major reason Ethereum had been climbing in recent months. He said that if demand stays at this pace, ETH could cross back over $4,000 by the end of the year. Looking forward, Geoff said treasury holdings could rise to 10% of total ETH supply. He pointed to the benefits of staking and DeFi as the main drivers. Get seen where it counts.

The tweet quoted Schwartz stating that he, along with Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto, identified key flaws in Bitcoin and sought to design a blockchain system that addressed those limitations. According to Xaif’s tweet, Schwartz emphasized that the team aimed to create something “faster, more efficient, and truly decentralized,” diverging from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work design. Attached to the tweet was a video of Schwartz recounting the timeline and technical rationale that led to the development of XRPL, beginning in 2011. David Schwartz explains how $XRP was created! ""Jed, arthur and I didn’t just follow Bitcoin we saw its flaws. Mining wasn’t fair. So we built something faster, more efficient, and truly decentralized."" https://t.co/eGcwn31J0u pic.twitter.com/cDx7Gw1BQg — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 1, 2025 Early Motivation and Design Philosophy In the video, Schwartz clarified that the initial concept came from Jed McCaleb in 2011, at a time when proof-of-work (PoW) was considered essential to the success of Bitcoin . Schwartz noted that despite the prevailing sentiment, signs were already emerging that PoW might not be a sustainable or fair model for blockchain consensus. He stated that one of the early assumptions was that mining would remain an open process accessible to anyone with computing power. However, over time, it became clear that this model naturally evolved into a centralized structure favoring the most efficient operators, thereby creating systemic inequities and entrenched stakeholders. Schwartz explained that McCaleb introduced the idea of replacing PoW with a distributed agreement algorithm—an approach long established in computer science but largely unexplored in blockchain systems. Schwartz began working on the implementation of this concept in November 2011 to validate whether a PoW-free blockchain could function effectively and what unique properties it might offer. Technical Breakthroughs and Differentiation The Ripple CTO stated that they quickly discovered the model worked and offered distinctive features not present in Bitcoin. Notably, the consensus algorithm employed in XRPL was “leaderless,” eliminating the need for a single block producer. Schwartz explained that in systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, a selected entity produces each block, which introduces the potential for transaction manipulation, especially in use cases such as asset exchanges. The XRP Ledger, by contrast, did not rely on a designated leader, which made it particularly suitable for fair and transparent financial operations.

Arthur Britto recognized early on that the absence of a block producer mitigated risks such as front-running, reordering of transactions, or selective censorship. As a result, the team designed an exchange where participants could place offers and conduct trades with reduced systemic risk. Multi-Asset Ledger and Liquidity Pools Drawing inspiration from Ryan Fugger’s earlier work in 2004 , the team extended XRPL to support issued assets, which Schwartz described as the earliest version of stablecoins. The design incorporated a decentralized exchange (DEX) and an account-based model, instead of Bitcoin’s UTXO model. These changes enabled multi-asset transactions and improved interoperability. Schwartz pointed out that even those who believed Bitcoin would dominate global finance had to acknowledge the transitional nature of value across different assets. In that context, a multi-asset ledger was necessary. He stated that the XRPL was pitched in mid-2012 as a feature-complete platform where users could access public liquidity pools. The system allowed users to hold one asset and make payments in another through automated pathfinding and efficient order routing. This flexibility, he said, addressed the reality that the vast majority of global value was not denominated in Bitcoin or any single cryptocurrency. Completion and Legacy According to Schwartz, by early to mid-2012, the XRPL was essentially complete with the same core features it maintains today, including account models, issued assets, XRP as a native currency, and a built-in decentralized exchange. The technology was structured around efficient transaction execution, decentralized liquidity, and practical interoperability across multiple assets. Schwartz concluded that these elements positioned the XRPL as a uniquely capable blockchain platform, especially for financial applications that required fairness, speed, and decentralization.

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to increase to a maximum level of $0.4724 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.67 The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens were unlocked in July 2025, marking the largest token release in the project’s history. The unlock began on July 4, this unlock has raised concerns around selling pressure and market instability, especially as the current Pi sentiment remains cautious. Historically, similar events have triggered sharp declines in Pi coin price, and with over $215 million worth of tokens entering the market, the downside risk remains significant.The Pi2Day 2025, ran from June 28 to July 7 and featured the highly anticipated Ecosystem Challenge. 2.6 million new users participated, exploring new releases such as Pi App Studio, Ecosystem Directory Staking, and updated Node tools. The event highlighted Pi’s growing ecosystem, with more than 21,700 dApps created and over 37.7 million PI staked to promote apps within the network .Despite this momentum, volatility has intensified. As of August 2, 2025, Pi has hit a new all-time low of $0.341, down 86.48% from its February high of $2.98 ,with a market cap of $3.14B, day trading volume of $91.35M, and an FDV of $40.52B.PI Still, has no major exchange listings or capital inflows, Pi’s short-term price trajectory may remain under pressure. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and ecosystem developments to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031.

Support is holding strong around $0.3390, limiting downside momentum in the current session. Resistance at $0.3610 is hindering any short-term upward price movement. On August 2, 2025, the Pi Network’s daily chart reflects a continued bearish bias, with narrow-bodied candles clustering around $0.3506. The session closed at $0.3506, marking a 1.82% decline after reaching a high of $0.3610 and a low of $0.3392. This price behaviour follows a failed breakout attempt, with sustained selling pressure driving the price into a tight consolidation range. Pi 1-day price chart: Consolidation Below $0.36 On 24 24-hour price chart, Pi/USDT closed at $0.3508, down 1.82%, after ranging between $0.3392 and $0.3610. The chart shows continued consolidation following a failed breakout near $0.39. The RSI is at 23.59, indicating that Pi is deeply oversold. This suggests weak bullish momentum and strong selling pressure. A reversal is possible, but there’s no confirmation yet. The MACD line sits at 0.0057, showing a flat and neutral trend. There’s no bullish crossover, and momentum remains weak with minimal separation from the signal line. Pi/Usdt Chart By TradingView Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour chart shows continued downside pressure, with price trading at $0.3506 after a failed attempt to hold above the $0.3610 resistance. The pair reached a session low of $0.3392, reflecting strong selling activity and rejection of a daily high. The RSI is at 12.75, also in oversold territory but slightly higher than the daily timeframe, hinting at early signs of stabilization. The MACD line is at approximately 0.0056, with a very narrow gap between the MACD and the signal line, showing weak bearish momentum and limited volatility. Pi/Usdt Chart By TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.482787 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.443213 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.481541 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.505813 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.462845 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.496928 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.556087 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.661828 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? If the selling pressure continues, the next support lies near $0.3300, a level that could act as a short-term floor. However, if that fails, Pi may retest the $0.3000 area. On the upside, the $0.3610 resistance must be reclaimed for any bullish reversal to materialise. That would need strong volume and a change in market sentiment. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? Pi’s drop reflects a perfect storm of token unlocks, technical breakdowns, and sector-wide risk aversion. While oversold conditions could invite a bounce, sustained recovery hinges on reduced sell pressure and broader altcoin strength. Will slowing August unlocks finally stabilise PI, or will weak demand prolong the downtrend? Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions On July 25, 2025, Analyst Dr Altcoin pointed out in an X post that some Pi users are reporting compromised wallets and stolen passphrases. He notes that this is a serious issue and the Pi Core Team needs to address it. According to him, relying solely on a passphrase to access a Pi wallet is a major security risk. If that passphrase is stolen or leaked, anyone can access the wallet and drain the funds Pi Network reminded users that both pre- and post-migration Lockups are now available, enabling Pioneers to boost their mining rate.

In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.48–$0.52, range. As of July 19, 2025 PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. As of July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continues to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remains subdued As of August 2, 2025, Pi trades at $0.3496, still under pressure and to its all-time low.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 13:00:00

At the same time, Remittix is getting strong attention after raising almost $18 million by selling 578 million tokens at $0.0895 each. Many see the Remittix DeFi project as a faster-moving Cardano 2.0 contender with crypto with real utility and low gas fees. The question many traders ask now is who moves first this month, ADA with a breakout or RTX with faster adoption. Cardano price prediction: path to $3 and what could come next Source: Ali Martinez On the weekly chart, ADA shows a flat base near $0.85 that mirrors the setup before its last big move. Key resistance sits at $1.15, $1.74, and $3 , and a strong break could extend the Cardano price prediction toward $6.25 if momentum builds. Analysts note the 0.5 Fibonacci zone near $0.85 as a pivot that often flips from supply to support, which helps a bullish Cardano price prediction. If sellers press, buyers may try again near $0.70 and $0.64 before any rebound. Ali Martinez also points out that the current structure looks like the last cycle but slower, which still supports a patient Cardano price prediction. With volume, trend strength, and clean closes over each level, the Cardano price prediction into Q3 can stay intact as Cardano builds a base for the next leg. Remittix (RTX): why rotation favors a utility-first rival Remittix aims to make cross-border payouts simple with low gas fee crypto, Crypto staking, and a cross-chain DeFi project design for workers, freelancers, and businesses.

Following this rally, ETH has retraced over 12%, breaking below the $3,450 level as the market digests recent gains. The sharp pullback has sparked concerns of a deeper correction; however, on-chain data and market fundamentals paint a more optimistic picture. Related Reading: Ethereum Taker Sell Volume Hits $335M In Just 2 Minutes: Panic Or Profit-Taking? Despite the price drop, Ethereum’s underlying strength remains intact. Whale addresses continue to accumulate during this dip, signaling high-conviction buying from large investors who are positioning for long-term gains. Additionally, Ethereum network activity is rising, with metrics such as new addresses, transaction volume, and smart contract interactions climbing back to levels last seen during previous bull cycles. The broader narrative around Ethereum also remains bullish, driven by its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and stablecoin infrastructure. As institutional adoption grows and regulatory clarity improves, ETH’s fundamental value proposition continues to strengthen. Ethereum Network Growth Surges Top analyst Ted Pillows has shared key data from Glassnode revealing a massive surge in Ethereum network activity. According to Pillows, the number of new ETH addresses created in a single day recently hit 256,817—a figure that matches the network growth rates observed during Ethereum’s historic bull runs in 2017 and 2021. This milestone comes despite the market experiencing a recent price correction, signaling that investor interest and on-chain adoption remain robust. Such a sharp increase in new addresses is often viewed as a leading indicator of future price expansion. It reflects a growing influx of new participants entering the ecosystem, whether for DeFi, NFTs, or tokenized assets. Analysts see this rise in user activity as a foundational driver that could fuel Ethereum’s next rally, especially as ETH continues to trade just below multi-year highs. Adding to this momentum is the wave of legal clarity in the United States, which has removed significant regulatory uncertainty around Ethereum’s status. Institutional adoption is also accelerating, with large financial firms increasingly integrating Ethereum-based solutions into their offerings, from stablecoin infrastructure to tokenized securities platforms.

Despite short-term price fluctuations, the network’s explosive growth hints at the potential for further continuation above previous cycle highs. Ethereum Tests Key Support After Sharp Breakdown Ethereum has experienced a sharp breakdown from its recent consolidation range, with the price falling to $3,454.41 after failing to hold above the $3,600 level. The chart shows a clean rejection from the $3,860 resistance zone, leading to increased selling pressure that accelerated as ETH broke below the 50 and 100-period moving averages on the 4-hour timeframe. The next critical support now lies around the $3,450 level, which has acted as a previous accumulation zone during the last bullish leg. Volume has surged on this move down, suggesting that a significant portion of this drop is driven by short-term panic selling and liquidation cascades. However, the 200-period SMA is still positioned well below current levels, at $3,192.22, indicating that the broader uptrend remains intact unless that area is breached. Related Reading: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet If bulls manage to defend this $3,450 level and reclaim $3,600 quickly, Ethereum could stabilize and attempt a new rally towards the $3,860 resistance.

Litecoin is targeting a move toward $105, with technical indicators and rising derivatives activity supporting that trajectory. Stellar is also on watch as it consolidates within a narrow band. Traders are paying close attention to this tightening pattern, which often precedes a volatility shift and directional push. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is attracting attention through a broader strategy. With $359 million raised, 24.6 billion coins sold, a 10 BTC Auction, and confirmed sports sponsorships, its momentum is built on more than just price signals. Litecoin Builds Toward $105 as Chart Pattern Signals Strength Litecoin is showing signs of a possible breakout, with a symmetrical triangle pattern forming on the charts. The price is approaching resistance around the $90 level, and analysts believe a decisive move above it could open the path to $105. Recent trading volume and rising interest in Litecoin derivatives are adding confidence to this bullish setup. Supportive technical models also suggest a steady upward trajectory in the near term, provided market stability holds. Historically, similar chart formations have led to short-term rallies, making this a key moment for traders tracking momentum. Stellar’s Price Compression Could Set Up a Sharp Move Stellar is trading within a tightening range, with price action compressing near strong support levels. Sellers have been unable to drive the price lower, while buyers continue to step in at key zones. This type of narrowing pattern often signals a buildup before a larger price move. Volume has pulled back slightly, suggesting temporary indecision, but technical indicators remain neutral. Traders are now watching for a breakout above resistance, which could confirm bullish momentum and bring Stellar back into the spotlight for short-term gains. BlockDAG Taps Sports and Bitcoin Hype to Drive Final Presale Surge BlockDAG is merging the worlds of crypto and mainstream entertainment with two headline-grabbing campaigns that define its final presale chapter. At the center is a 10 BTC Auction, open until August 11, that rewards BDAG buyers with a share of 10 Bitcoin. The more coins purchased, the larger the share of the pot, creating a high-stakes incentive loop that scales with volume. Alongside this, BlockDAG has secured partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, two prominent teams in U.S. rugby and cricket. These deals bring BlockDAG into stadiums, fan merch, and digital broadcast channels, attracting attention from audiences that rarely overlap with blockchain. The visibility creates a unique crossover moment where new demographics are exposed to crypto through teams they already follow. This dual-track campaign is already reflected in the numbers. BlockDAG has raised $359 million, sold 24.6 billion coins, and is currently in Batch 29 at $0.0276. However, through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, buyers can still lock in a $0.0016 price until August 11. That translates into a 3,025% upside before it hits its confirmed listing price of $0.05. By anchoring itself in both real-world fandom and crypto innovation, BlockDAG is expanding far beyond its original audience. The 10 BTC reward, sports visibility, and strong presale metrics combine to place it firmly in the spotlight heading into its final presale window. Final Thoughts While Litecoin and Stellar offer promising technical setups that could support short-term gains, BlockDAG is gaining strength from broader fundamentals. Its $359 million presale, limited-time $0.0016 price window, and visibility through the 10 BTC Auction and sports sponsorships create a multi-dimensional advantage that extends beyond typical market trends. Those focused on chart signals may lean toward traditional plays, but BlockDAG delivers a mix of strong performance metrics and real-world positioning. With 24.6 billion coins sold and major momentum ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, it remains one of the most closely watched projects in this cycle.

49420729,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76526,1754139672,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Uphold’s $1000 XRP Price Sparks Fresh Reactions,https://timestabloid.com/upholds-1000-xrp-price-sparks-fresh-reactions/,"A revived social media post by HchannelX has reignited debate in the XRP community, following his hypothetical question: “What would you do if XRP reached $1,000?” While this question was originally posed years ago and not meant as a price prediction, its resurgence has prompted a wave of reactions, speculation, and renewed discussion about the future potential of XRP. XRP’s Current Market Position As of the report time, XRP is trading at approximately $2.94, with a daily range of $2.91 to $3.05. The token currently holds a market capitalization of around $174 billion, with a circulating supply of roughly 59.3 billion XRP. Despite making a strong recovery in early 2025, reaching highs near $3.65, XRP has seen a moderate pullback due to broader market volatility and recent waves of crypto liquidations. Uphold ""What would you do if $XRP reached $1000? "" 7/15, 10/20, 11/22 & 12/9 https://t.co/Srk0k9Te2Y pic.twitter.com/Um9gLBaeS4 — HchannelX (@XFamily369) August 1, 2025 The $1,000 Dream: Hope or Hype? If XRP were ever to reach $1,000 per token, its market capitalization would soar beyond $59 trillion, exceeding the total GDP of nearly every country in the world. Such a valuation would surpass the combined capitalization of all global stock markets, making it virtually impossible under current economic frameworks. Analysts and economists widely agree that a $1,000 price tag for XRP is, at best, an extreme outlier scenario that would require a financial revolution of unprecedented scale. Nonetheless, that hasn’t stopped XRP enthusiasts from dreaming. Many responded to HchannelX’s repost of Uphold’s question with humor, while others took it seriously, envisioning life-changing wealth. At $1,000 per token, even holding 1,000 XRP (worth under $3,000 today) would result in $1 million. These dreams fuel ongoing belief in XRP’s long-term value, even if the path to such a milestone remains uncertain. What’s Driving XRP Today? XRP’s rally earlier this year was driven by multiple tailwinds: increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF, improving regulatory clarity, and growing adoption within institutional corridors. Legal victories in 2023 and 2024, including Judge Torres’ ruling that XRP sales on exchanges do not constitute securities offerings, gave the token renewed credibility in U.S. markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, macroeconomic pressures, profit-taking, and risk-off sentiment have since cooled momentum. Despite this, XRP remains one of the few cryptocurrencies with a defined utility, namely cross-border payments and enterprise blockchain integrations. Could $1,000 Ever Be Possible? While prominent analysts have forecast long-term price targets ranging from $4 to $20 and even $100, few give serious consideration to $1,000 as a realistic outcome. To justify that valuation, XRP would need to replace significant portions of global financial infrastructure, something even XRP’s staunchest supporters acknowledge would take decades, not years. Even then, such a price is more symbolic of community belief than a rational forecast rooted in economic fundamentals. Final Thoughts Uphold’s old $1,000 XRP prompt, resurfaced by HchannelX, continues to stoke excitement in the XRP community. While the dream lives on in memes and speculative discussion, real-world data suggests XRP’s price remains bound by economic reality. With strong fundamentals, legal clarity, and growing institutional interest, XRP has solid long-term prospects, but a four-figure valuation is, for now, a vision rather than a viable projection.

Soon after that, they issued BNB as a native token for its ecosystem. One of the features that makes it original is BNB’s supply limit of 200 million and Binance’s regularly scheduled BNB “burns.” These are intended to halve its supply effectively. The company cryptographically locks up some of its own BNB tokens in a way that makes them impossible ever to retrieve or spend again, thus “burning” them. As a result, the value of the remaining BNB supply increases in an exchange economy against fiat currencies and stablecoins. That’s a way for the company to share some of the profit with all the other token holders. It provides built-in, long-term support for BNB price growth. So far, ROIs for long-term BNB holders have been very attractive when compared to returns on investment for US stock owners. Here are some eye-popping BNB crypto token figures, milestones, and comparisons for you. 1. BNB Price Record High To Date (Jul. 28): $850 The BNB price rally on crypto exchanges in July took it to an all-time high record of $850. Even though the price has since declined by some 12%, this is still a very impressive accomplishment. Over the past month, that’s a +14% ROI, after settling down to $755 at the time of this writing. This also makes for an impressive growth of around 35% in the past 365 days. Since debuting on crypto exchanges at $0.10 for 1 BNB coin eight years ago in July 2017, that’s an ROI of 849,900%. It’s an average annualized ROI of 106,237% for Binance tokens over the eight years since the landmark crypto bull market year of 2017. BNB Tokens vs. S&P 500 US Stocks Compared By comparison, the S&P 500 Index grew by 158% from Jul. 2017 until this July. The average annualized ROI of 19.75% for the past eight years was well above average for the broad US stock market benchmark. For many decades now, the S&P 500 has delivered around 10% yearly ROI. The eight-year ROI from 2017 BNB tokens, approaching one million percent, is staggering compared to the 158% growth from stocks that most people’s grandparents are relying on to keep their retirement years secure and comfortable. Investing relatively small amounts of money in Binance in 2017 has remarkably produced a significantly life-changing, trajectory-altering financial result for the average household or business. Are results this extraordinary and unheard of even real? Is there something questionable or dubious about them? 2. BNB Market Cap Surpasses $100 Billion Amazon shares delivered investors 298,666% ROI in 28 years. Something almost three times that gargantuan percentage in less than a third of the time is par for the course with the Internet’s accelerating rates of market adoption for new tech platforms. Binance and its BNB currency are no small flash in the pan. Comparisons to US tech giants Microsoft and Amazon are apt and plentiful. It’s not just BNB’s price growth and ROI that are impressive, but its market cap. The total market capitalization for the BNB economy surpassed $100 billion in July for the third time since last December and in Nov. 2021. Binance is just eight years old. In 28 years, Amazon has grown to be a nearly $2.5 trillion market cap company by common stock shares. The sheer, relentless, daily volume of profitable business that Binance conducts with customers, swapping cryptocurrencies for a small fee per transaction, supports the growth in its native token’s market cap and exchange prices. Binance has gotten into trouble with the U.S. government for anti-money laundering law violations and settled them with the Department of Justice by paying a stiff $4.3 billion fine. That puts the exchange in the same company as every banking giant like JP Morgan in Warren Buffett’s portfolio, which has also paid massive corporate fines to the US government over similar cases. 3. Nanotech Grabs Corporate BNB Treasuries In 2025 Meanwhile, another corporate treasury stockpile race is brewing over BNB tokens. Michael Saylor and his Washington, D.C.-based Strategy, Inc. have started investing in Bitcoin over the past four years. Now, even the US government is collaborating with the crypto bros to stockpile BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. Then you’ve got a publicly traded hotel company in Japan and an online sports betting company in Minnesota piling billions into Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, two nanotech firms are buying BNB tokens to establish their own corporate crypto treasuries. Chinese microchip designer Nano Labs is snapping up some $90 million worth of 120,000 BNB tokens to rebalance its corporate finances. Pennsylvania-based biotech firm Windtree Therapeutics announced on July 24 that it is committing $520 million to its BNB token treasury strategy, a move aimed at attracting major institutional investment, bringing its total to $700 million.

Key Takeaways: The crypto industry has donated over $26 million to Trump’s campaign in 2024. Major contributors include Blockchain.com, Gemini, Andreessen Horowitz, and Paradigm. Trump’s pro-crypto policies have raised support, alongside concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Campaign finance records show that contributions to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., came from some of the biggest names in crypto, according to a recent report from Axios . Blockchain.com led the list with a $5 million donation. Venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz each gave $3 million, while Gemini Trust added nearly $3 million. Winklevoss Twins Personally Donate $1M in Crypto to Trump Campaign Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss also contributed $500,000 each personally. Other major donors include Ondo Finance with $2.1 million and Paradigm, which gave $1.2 million. The influx signals deepening ties between Trump and crypto players as the former president positions himself as a champion of the industry. His administration has pushed through several pro-crypto moves since returning to office, including signing the GENIUS Act , the first federal legislation addressing stablecoins. Trump’s administration is also pressuring Congress to pass the CLARITY Act , a sweeping regulatory framework for digital assets. Furthermore, Trump has introduced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and released a 160-page report outlining plans to support open-source crypto infrastructure and defend user privacy. BREAKING NEWS ALERT: Donald Trump announces that he is accepting presidential campaign donations paid in cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/JCtvHqUsR2 — 𝓣 𝓞 𝓟 𝓓 𝓞 𝓖 𝓔 (@TOPDOGE007) May 9, 2024 While the policy momentum has drawn praise from industry leaders, it’s also sparked criticism over potential conflicts of interest. Members of the Trump family are involved in a range of crypto ventures—from stablecoins and meme coins to NFTs and Bitcoin mining—raising concerns about profiting from sectors directly impacted by his administration’s decisions. The filings suggest Trump has become the preferred candidate for a large swath of the crypto industry, at a time when regulatory uncertainty remains a central concern. Trump’s Crypto Holdings Make Up Key Portion of His Fortune Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth . Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates that TMTG stock represents $2.2 billion of Trump’s $6.6 billion fortune. His broader cryptocurrency investments are believed to have gained at least $620 million in recent months. However, the move is raising concerns among some industry figures. Nick Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures and a Trump supporter, said the overlap between Trump’s political influence and his financial exposure to crypto markets could create a conflict of interest. “It’s always a headache to have businesses with conflicting interests,” he told Bloomberg. As reported, nearly 70 nominees and officials in the Trump administration reportedly hold crypto or investments in blockchain companies , with holdings ranging from modest sums to over $120 million. The group includes Vice President JD Vance and seven Cabinet members or nominees, who collectively disclosed at least $2 million in crypto assets. Critics warn that this creates potential conflicts of interest and normalizes risky crypto investments among public servants.

49421404,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=777971,1754140601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49421404.jpeg,First glimpses of Volume 1 of Ripple's OCC banking license application emerge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-occ-banking-license-application/,"Ripple has tuned up its mission to expand its financial infrastructure, taking a formal step by releasing Volume 1 of its Interagency Charter Application that it submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The analysis of the document outlines the proposal to establish the Ripple National Trust Bank. The bank is expected to be a limited national trust bank that would operate as a subsidiary of Ripple Labs, with its headquarters in New York. While Ripple has garnered its popularity through its native digital asset XRP, the application will focus more on the use of its native stablecoin RLUSD. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, publicly confirmed the company’s application for a national trust bank charter with the OCC on July 2. In his statement, he said the company’s goal is to create a structure that brings its RLUSD stablecoin under both federal and state oversight. According to Garlinghouse , the move is expected to establish a “new and unique benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.” Ripple releases Volume 1 of its OCC application According to the filing, Ripple is not applying for a traditional banking license, which will involve taking deposits or lending activities. Instead, the bank is expected to handle fiduciary activities, allowing it to provide custody and infrastructure services in line with the oversight of the OCC. In addition, the trust bank is not expected to fall under the Community Reinvestment Act, which only applies to institutions that engage in deposits or lending. The application notes that “as a national trust bank, the Trust Bank will not be subject to the CRA.” This positions the bank within a business-to-business (B2B) framework, focusing on custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management rather than retail banking. The application also expressly did not mention XRP, with crypto commentators noting that it might be a deliberate act to separate both entities. By removing XRP, the move will ensure that any entanglement is avoided, considering XRP has been a subject of legal scrutiny in the past. However, this doesn’t rule out an XRP integration in the future, but it remains to be seen what may happen. Meanwhile, another dimension to the filing shares a relationship to the internal structure of Ripple and compensation plans. This applies to a confidential stock benefit plan included in an unpublished exhibit, revealing that the company intends to issue private stock to executives and insiders. While this practice is not unusual, commentators mentioned that the confidentiality shows a broader corporate strategy, potentially in anticipation of increased scrutiny or even a future Initial Public Offering (IPO). Five-man governance panel shows commitment to oversight The Trust Bank’s operational and governance structure also shows that Ripple is committed to experienced oversight. The list comprises organizers like John McDonald, an experienced financial executive and President of Standard Custody & Trust Company, and John Zavaglia, Ripple’s Treasurer with extensive experience in corporate finance and treasury operations. The list also includes Stuart Alderoty , Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer. Alderoty boasts over 35 years of experience in regulatory and legal leadership across various financial institutions. Timothy Keaney, a former Vice Chairman of BNY Mellon, and David Puth, former CEO of CLS Group and Centre Consortium, are also on the list.

The crypto space is no stranger to hype cycles, but Bitcoin Swift is attracting attention for more practical reasons. Its unique blend of adaptive rewards, AI governance, and hybrid consensus is drawing in investors seeking more than meme-fueled speculation. Avalanche delivered impressive infrastructure for developers and DeFi, while DOGE and Shiba Inu rode waves of meme culture and social media. Their communities remain active, and their contributions to crypto history cannot be dismissed. Yet none of these projects integrated a protocol where rewards are dynamic, contracts are intelligent, and governance is reputation-weighted from day one. Bitcoin Swift builds on these gaps with a forward-facing approach to blockchain utility. Bitcoin Swift: A Different Class of Blockchain Bitcoin Swift is not positioning itself as just another decentralized chain. Instead, it is marketed as a financial operating system, blending adaptive Proof-of-Yield, AI-powered smart contracts, decentralized identity protection, and hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms. This architecture is built for scalability, compliance, and long-term decentralization. At its core, Bitcoin Swift’s Proof-of-Yield system does what static models cannot. It adjusts block rewards in real time based on network activity, environmental factors, and governance votes. The result is a living ecosystem where incentives evolve alongside user participation. This level of responsiveness is rare in crypto and stands out to those who have grown tired of fixed systems that fail to adapt. AI plays a significant role throughout the protocol. Smart contracts hosted on a WASM-compatible engine embed AI agents capable of learning from network patterns and adjusting behavior accordingly. Federated AI oracles supply trusted data streams, strengthening the foundation for decentralized applications. Security and trust are reinforced by audits from Spywolf Audit and Solidproof Audit , giving confidence to those engaging with the ecosystem. Hybrid Consensus: Proof-of-Yield + Proof-of-Stake Finalization Bitcoin Swift’s layered consensus delivers security and adaptability in equal measure. Proof-of-Work secures the network with SHA-256 Proof-of-Stake validators handle governance checkpoints and finalize transactions Regular checkpointing protects transparency and ensures stability This combination allows Bitcoin Swift to maintain integrity while scaling for future adoption. AI Smart Contracts and Privacy Architecture Bitcoin Swift embeds AI directly into its smart contracts for enhanced functionality. AI oracles provide real-time, federated data Smart contracts evolve based on live metrics and governance inputs Quadratic voting enhances governance with DID-weighted reputation systems Privacy remains a core focus. Bitcoin Swift uses zk-SNARK technology and decentralized identity systems to allow users to verify credentials without exposing sensitive information. These privacy protections apply equally to transactions and governance, ensuring users retain control over their data.

The son of U.S. President Donald Trump made similar remarks earlier this year when economic uncertainty was already clouded by tariff pressures. At that time, he called it a “great time” to buy the two leading cryptocurrencies. Market Swings Continue Ethereum later plummeted below $1,400, hitting its lowest level since November 2023. But a sharp reversal followed, driven by a mix of improving investor sentiment and increasing signs of corporate adoption. By earlier this week, Ethereum had surged back to around $3,900. However, the recovery has since stalled. As of press time, Ethereum had pulled back to roughly $3,500, marking a 3% decline over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin also saw a slight dip, trading near $113,500, according to CoinGecko. Trump Family’s Crypto Exposure Eric Trump’s vocal support for digital assets isn’t new, nor is it symbolic. In December, he disclosed holdings in multiple cryptocurrencies—including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui. His involvement extends to crypto mining as well. American Bitcoin, a mining company linked to both Eric and Donald Trump Jr., currently holds 215 BTC. In another notable move, World Liberty Financial—a decentralized finance (DeFi) venture backed by the Trump family—reportedly acquired 77,226 ETH at an average entry price of $3,294 per coin. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that some of these Ethereum holdings may have been sold at a loss during the April market dip. Legislative Tailwinds Meet Volatility Despite short-term volatility, the broader crypto market continues to find support in pro-crypto legislative developments and institutional moves. Still, macroeconomic concerns, particularly around renewed tariff implementations, have tempered enthusiasm. The U.S. administration’s latest trade posturing has triggered risk aversion across equities and digital assets alike. Eric Trump, however, appears unfazed by the pullback. By reiterating his confidence in Ethereum and Bitcoin, he’s aligning with the growing number of institutional voices that see crypto as a long-term hedge against policy-driven economic uncertainty.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-02 13:35:59

Over $700 million in liquidations hit the crypto market in just one day. Bitcoin’s dominance soared above 62% as the Fear and Greed Index fell. On August 1, 2025, Bitcoin’s price plunged below $113,000 for the first time since July 10, sparking significant market upheaval. This sharp decline triggered a wave of forced liquidations across cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, resulting in over $700 million in liquidated positions within just 24 hours. Nearly 161,000 traders had their positions forcibly closed, leading to losses exceeding $423 million among long position holders and approximately $85 million among short sellers. The largest single liquidation occurred on the ETH/USDC pair on Binance, amounting to $4.45 million. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum bore the brunt of these liquidations, with positions worth around $161 million and $265 million respectively being closed. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market rose significantly, surpassing 62%, highlighting its resilience as altcoins experienced even steeper losses. Investor sentiment has turned cautious, as reflected by the Fear and Greed Index dropping nine points to 51 over the past 24 hours, signaling growing market apprehension. Bitcoin’s recent decline was driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors, including the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain high interest rates and tougher global regulatory developments. These contributed to reduced capital inflows, with new investments into the crypto sector dropping noticeably during late July and early August. Notably, August is historically one of Bitcoin’s weakest months, with average declines ranging from 5% to 20% over the past decade. Technical factors also played a role: Bitcoin’s failure to breach important resistance levels near $122,000 led to traders locking in profits, further fueling the sell-off. Analysts highlight that if support around $112,000 is lost, prices could see additional downside risk towards $106,000 in the near term. During this turbulence, altcoins experienced larger percentage losses than Bitcoin, underlining the increased risk-off sentiment among investors.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-02 13:43:09

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $853.93. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,280.9 to $1,387.64. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $254.95 Market cap $3.87B Trading volume (24-h) $421.89M Circulating supply 15.2M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $250.41 24-hour high $260.68 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.47% 50-day SMA $285.51 14-Day RSI 35.49 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $206.93 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE broke multiple support levels, with indicators confirming downtrend continuation. The RSI suggests a possible short-term relief rally above $249. The $249 support level remains critical for AAVE. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE breaks multiple support levels as sell pressure heightens The AAVE daily chart for August 2 reveals a series of large red candles that have systematically broken through key support levels at $309, $295, and $280, with the current price hovering dangerously close to the $249 support zone. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator confirms the bearish momentum, with the signal line and histogram remaining deeply negative. This technical breakdown suggests the selling pressure remains intense, and traders should watch the $249 level closely as a break below could trigger a further dip toward the $240 region. Aave 4-hour price chart: Trend remains largely bearish despite oversold conditions On the 4-hour chart, the Alligator indicator shows all three lines pointing downward with price trading well below them, indicating the bears maintain full control of the trend structure. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI has plunged to oversold territory at 27.44, which typically signals a potential bounce. Still, the continued decline in On Balance Volume to 12.32M demonstrates that selling pressure persists despite the oversold reading. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $223.56 BUY SMA 5 $253.31 BUY SMA 10 $275.93 SELL SMA 21 $299.20 SELL SMA 50 $285.51 SELL SMA 100 $259.05 SELL SMA 200 $206.93 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $290.55 SELL EMA 5 $282.43 SELL EMA 10 $256.96 SELL EMA 21 $224.38 BUY EMA 50 $210.43 BUY EMA 100 $219.16 BUY EMA 200 $213.19 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE faces a critical test at the $249 support level, and failure to hold this zone could trigger rapid selling toward $240-235. Any bounce will likely struggle against the $280-295 resistance cluster, where the previous support levels now act as barriers to recovery. Is AAVE a good investment?

A major component of this outlook is the expectation that global finance will shift onto the XRP Ledger. Notably, this bold prediction came from the analyst known as ""Future XRP"" in a tweet . He stirred the XRP community with a valuation model that places the token’s future price at $3,380.The Bold Valuation ModelHe argues that at XRP’s current price of $3.00, with a 60 billion circulating supply and a velocity of 10, the network can already handle $1.3 trillion in annual on-chain volume.However, if XRP captures major portions of the financial system, including SWIFT, derivatives, FX markets, the DTCC, Amazon, and more, the volume could skyrocket to between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion annually. Notably, this hope is inspired by recent statements from Ripple executives and the company’s integration strategy.Specifically, last month, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that in five years, the XRP Ledger could take over about 14% of SWIFT’s volume. Meanwhile, in April, the company announced acquiring Hidden Road, which has connections to the DTCC, an institution that processes over $11 trillion in daily volume. These developments continue to fuel discussions in XRP circles about the coin’s potential price.According to the model proposed by ""Future XRP,"" if the circulating supply and velocity remain constant, XRP would need a 1,538 times price increase to accommodate a transaction volume of between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion. Per his estimate, this results in a $3,380 price tag for XRP.What That Means for XRP HoldersBased on this scenario, ""Future XRP"" outlined potential wealth outcomes for holders. He painted a picture where those holding 1,000 XRP would see their portfolio rise to $3.38 million. For 5,000 XRP, the value could reach $16.9 million.Holding 10,000 XRP might translate to $33.8 million, while 50,000 XRP could be worth $169 million. In this framework, XRP becomes a gateway to generational wealth, assuming the market shifts align with the forecast.Not Everyone AgreesExpectedly, the prediction sparked significant pushback in the crypto community. Critics pointed to the velocity assumptions, noting that traditional financial systems like SWIFT have much higher money turnover rates, up to 200 times annually. If XRP operated at those speeds, it could process $2 quadrillion with a token price closer to $166, not $3,380.Others questioned whether XRP could dominate the space alone, given the presence of competitors like Stellar, USDC, and Ethereum-based solutions.https://twitter.com/MbtHawk/status/1939118306453307431Grok AI Weighs InIn a follow-up comment, the analyst invited the AI system Grok 3 to weigh in on the numbers he proposed. The AI summarized the argument and tilted slightly in favor of the bulls.Specifically, it highlighted XRP’s potential role as a neutral settlement layer in a de-dollarizing world. Grok’s stated price range of $200 to $1,000 per XRP is ""realistic"" if XRP plays a central role in a tokenized financial system. However, hitting $3,000 would likely require a major global transition, such as a treasury collapse or an accelerated move away from fiat-based reserves.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|WALLET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-02 13:45:07

Coupled with a 96% positive sentiment from the investor community, there is growing speculation regarding its potential to yield up to 19 times return on investment. Introducing XYZVerse: A New Challenger in Meme Coin Arena Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse brings a unique flavor by integrating the world of sports, including football, basketball, MMA, and esports, with the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency. This blend not only differentiates it from others like Dogecoin but also establishes a robust community of passionate sports fans and crypto enthusiasts. Recognition has already begun to pour in as XYZVerse was recently named the Best New Meme Project. Such accolades hint at a promising future for this innovative crypto project. The Vision and Promise of XYZVerse With the ambitious title of the Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.), XYZVerse is not just another transient trend. Its long-term vision supported by a clear roadmap and a dedicated community positions it as a potential game-changer in the cryptocurrency market. The fervor of the sports world mirrors the high stakes and competitiveness of cryptocurrency investments. XYZVerse leverages this synergy to create a vibrant ecosystem where each stakeholder is driven by a shared passion for sports and potential high returns from their investments. The Competitive Edge: XYZVerse vs. Dogecoin Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that began as a joke in 2013, quickly captured the market’s imagination and soared in value, particularly during the crypto boom of 2021. Despite its playful origins, Dogecoin established a solid footing in the crypto world, supported by frequent endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. However, XYZVerse's targeted niche approach could potentially lead it to surpass Dogecoin's performance. With focused utility and community engagement, XYZVerse is poised to carve out its own significant place in the cryptocurrency landscape. The ongoing presale of XYZ tokens provides a golden opportunity for early investors to participate at a favorable price, with the promise of significant returns once the coin hits major exchanges.

The group called on the Senate to frame a key crypto draft bill in a tech-neutral way and strengthen crypto developer protections. DeFi Education Fund Calls On Senate To Revise Crypto Bill The DeFi Education Fund has asked the US Senate Banking Committee to rethink plans to regulate the decentralized finance industry after reviewing its discussion draft on a crucial key crypto market-structure bill. The group’s response was signed on behalf of other DeFi Education Fund members, a16z Crypto, Uniswap Labs, and Paradigm. It stated that the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 (RFA) must be crafted in a more tech-neutral manner. It also called on the committee to protect developers from “inappropriate regulation meant for intermediaries,” adding that self-custody rights were essential. The response stated, “DeFi developers and technology should be protected from inappropriate regulation meant for intermediaries. Self-custody protections for all US persons are essential. Legislation should address illicit finance but not unfairly burden DeFi innovation, and should maintain consumer protections and privacy rights.” According to the response, a dynamic and flexible regulatory framework will ensure that decentralized technology and its creators thrive in the US. “With thoughtful market structure legislation, the United States is poised to establish itself as a global leader in digital asset markets and innovation….A dynamic, forward-looking, and flexible regulatory framework will ensure that builders of decentralized technology can thrive in the United States.” The Senate Banking Committee welcomed the feedback as it builds on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 to promote innovation in the DeFi industry. Developer Protection Priority The DeFi Education Fund urged lawmakers to update FinCEN guidance following the trial of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm. “The rulemaking should reflect that technology that solely consists of non-custodial, non-controlling software shall not be regulated as a financial institution or financial intermediary. It also called for federal preemption of state laws to ensure consistent protection for crypto developers. “Well-resourced traditional financial institutions may exploit the fragmented regulatory landscape by funding or encouraging state-level enforcement actions against DeFi developers — not to protect consumers, but to stifle competition.” a16z Submits Separate Submission a16z Crypto, the crypto arm of venture capital firm a16z, submitted a separate response to the Senate Banking Committee. The firm criticised the bill, stating that it risks undermining investor protections by creating dangerous loopholes through the treatment of “ancillary assets.” It argued that redefining these assets without major changes is incompatible with existing US securities law, particularly the Howey Test.

According to reports, both countries also intend to depend on bilateral cooperation in aspects like blockchain technology and digital finance. The collaboration was agreed at a high-level virtual meeting between Bilal Bin Saqib, the Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain in Pakistan , and Farkhat Aminov, Director of Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency. During the meeting, both sides held detailed discussions on digital finance, regulatory frameworks, and blockchain innovation. They also discussed the importance of sharing knowledge, expertise, and best practices to foster the growth of their digital economies. Pakistan continues its push in the crypto industry According to local reports , Bilal Bin Saqib commended Kyrgyzstan’s leadership in digital assets innovation during the meeting, expressing Pakistan’s interest in developing a joint regulatory structure with them. He also noted that Pakistan is interested in advancing technology with Kyrgyzstan as its partners, proposing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a formal partnership in the crypto space. Pakistan has continued to make its push into the crypto industry, with the recent development in Kyrgyzstan showing how serious the country is in that regard. The country announced the formation of its Pakistan Crypto Council , a division that was charged with regulating and integrating blockchain technology into the country’s financial landscape. The formation of the Council came after the appointment of Bilal Bin Saqib as special adviser to Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb. Bin Saqib was subsequently appointed as the CEO of the Council, with Aurangzeb acting as the chairman of the Crypto Council. Meanwhile, both countries have reiterated their commitment to building a secure, transparent, and digital economy that is ready for the future, noting that the collaboration could enhance blockchain and digital finance integration across Central and South Asia. Pakistan extends its impact into Central Asia This latest development comes after the Press Information Department of Pakistan announced that both countries had signed several protocols and MoUs to deepen economic and technical cooperation, taking the bilateral trade volume to $100 million. The statement came after the 5th session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade, Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation in Islamabad. “The two sides reaffirmed their resolve to boost bilateral trade, setting a target to raise trade volume to USD 100 million,” the PID statement said. “They agreed to work on diversification of exports and imports, revive the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Joint Business Council, and organize business forums, trade fairs, and B2B (business-to-business) exchanges.” The development comes at a time when Pakistan is trying to leverage its strategic geopolitical position to engage in its role as an important trader and transit hub in the face of economic downturn. The country intends to connect the landlocked Central Asia with the rest of the world, engaging in a flurry of visits, investment talks, and economic activities with other Central Asian nations in the last few months. “Discussions also focused on enhancing regional connectivity through logistics and transportation. Both sides agreed to deepen cooperation in postal services, cargo and rail transport, and civil aviation,” the PID said. “Both countries underscored the importance of strengthening financial cooperation. The central banks of both countries agreed to collaborate on the development of Islamic banking and financial instruments, including training programs through Pakistan’s National Institute of Banking and Finance.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

It marks the highest monthly inflow since their market debut and reflects a sharp 369% rise from June’s inflow of $1.16 billion. With 20 straight days of net inflows, spot ETH ETFs are now cementing Ethereum’s growing role as a leading digital asset in the eyes of traditional market participants. Spot Ethereum ETFs Hit Milestone With $5.43 Billion Inflow According to data from SoSoValue, the $5.43 billion net inflow in July also dwarfed May’s $564 million and April’s $66.25 million. It completely reversed the negative outflow trend seen in March, which saw a $403 million drop. As a result of this rise, cumulative net inflows across all spot Ether ETFs have now reached $9.64 billion, showing a 129% increase compared to June’s cumulative total. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Reveals What Will Drive The XRP Price Value The massive growth didn’t stop at inflows alone. Total net assets across all spot ETH ETFs jumped to $21.52 billion, doubling from $10.32 billion just a month earlier. These funds now account for 4.77% of Ethereum’s entire market capitalization, showing that ETFs are becoming a gateway for capital entering the ETH market. Institutional interest has played a role in this growth as BlackRock’s ETHA remains the leading spot Ethereum ETF by assets, pulling in $18.18 million on July 31 and now holding $11.37 billion. Fidelity’s FETH also gained $5.62 million that same day, raising its net assets to $2.55 billion. Grayscale’s ETHE still manages a solid $4.22 billion asset base, even with a $6.8 million outflow, showing its continued relevance. Ethereum Price Rallies As ETF Inflows Hit New Highs The record-setting ETF inflows also lined up with a sharp price rally in ETH throughout July. ETH started the month at $2,486 and climbed to a high of $3,933, an increase of nearly 60%. By the end of the month, it had settled at $3,698, making July Ethereum’s strongest monthly price move since October 2021. The steady rise in ETF inflows could be a key driver behind this surge, showing that more capital entering the space may have directly boosted market sentiment and pricing. Related Reading: BlackRock Staking For Its Spot Ethereum ETF Has Been Acknowledged — But What’s Coming For ETH? The ETH rally also marked the longest bullish monthly candle in nearly three years. As prices climbed, the spot ETFs recorded their longest-ever streak of daily net inflows, 20 days in a row without a single outflow after July 8. Some of the single-day gains came mid-month, including $726.7 million on July 16, $602 million on July 17, and $533.8 million on July 22. Ethereum could challenge its all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021, as its rising role in decentralized finance and the growing use of regulated investment vehicles could help the asset. If the current pace of inflows and trading activity continues, it could soon take center stage in a broader altcoin-led market cycle.

Spartans .com recognizes this and builds its weekly cashback with consistency in mind. Instead of rotating deals or hidden conditions, Spartans offers a straightforward system that rewards active players predictably. If you’ve placed bets during the week and reached the minimum play amount, you’ll get back a portion of your net losses. No unclear caps, no fine print surprises. Spartans stands out in a space where reliable cashback is often hard to find. Reliable Cashback Outshines One-Time Deals Seasoned players understand how most bonuses favor the house. Eye-catching “100% match” offers often come with hard-to-meet playthroughs and unclear rules. Spartans offers something more grounded, a built-in cashback system designed around steady player activity. Rather than throw out random deals tied to specific games or short events, Spartans keeps it simple: play regularly, meet the required volume, and receive a set cashback amount. It’s not about one lucky night, it’s about long-term participation. This system appeals not just to new users but to experienced bettors who appreciate clear rules. Without complicated terms or exclusions, Spartans earns players’ trust and encourages consistent gameplay. That trust drives engagement far beyond one-off promos. Betting Volume Over Luck-Based Bonuses Most platforms promote lucky spins or random jackpots. Spartans takes a different approach by focusing on how often you play, not how lucky you are. Whether you’re on a winning streak or taking losses, regular betting still earns cashback. This reward model gives committed users more control. It’s especially attractive for frequent bettors who want dependable value, not just the thrill of short-lived promos. With cashback tied to net losses, users get some relief during tough weeks, and it’s a genuine benefit, not just a marketing hook. Even without using online betting bonus codes every time, Spartans keeps giving back through this cashback setup. It’s not an extra, it’s part of the platform’s core structure. No Confusing Terms or Reward Caps Many sites throw around big percentages like “20% cashback” but quietly hide caps, exclusions, or limited game eligibility. Spartans avoids this. The rules are clear: meet the minimum play volume, and you’ll receive your cashback, with the rate applied transparently. That simplicity makes a difference. Players don’t have to guess which bets count or worry about surprise clauses. Knowing exactly how cashback is earned and paid boosts confidence, and with confidence comes loyalty. When combined with regular online betting bonus codes, Spartans gives players both ongoing returns and the occasional short-term boost. You don’t have to choose between the two, it’s all part of the experience. Designed to Keep Players, Not Just Attract Them Most betting sites focus their promotions on signing up new users. Spartans chooses to prioritize the players who stick around. Its weekly cashback doesn’t come with fanfare, it runs quietly but consistently in the background. This appeals to those who plan their bets and manage their budgets. Knowing that some losses will be offset helps players stay in control. It’s not about chasing bonuses, it’s about playing smart. By rewarding regulars and not just newcomers, Spartans builds a stable, loyal user base. Cashback becomes a key reason players stay active, especially when used alongside online betting bonus codes that enhance the experience without compromising fairness. A Loyalty Program That Truly Pays Off Spartans.com has taken the uncertainty out of bonus programs by offering a cashback structure that’s actually useful. It doesn’t rely on gimmicks or luck, it’s based on measurable player activity. For those who play often and want to get value back even in down weeks, Spartans provides trust, reliability, and clear returns. Paired with flexible online betting bonus codes, the platform gives players real reasons to keep coming back.

The decline comes amid a confluence of bearish political and macroeconomic developments, including a poor US jobs report, sweeping trade tariffs on key partners, and renewed tensions with Russia. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, having reclaimed $113,000 and moving to $113,796. Bitcoin (BTC) Sinks As Crypto Liquidations Hit $900 Million Bitcoin (BTC) and other top cryptocurrencies plunged into the red, registering substantial declines on Thursday and Friday. The flagship cryptocurrency nosedived, falling to an intraday low of $112,792 before registering a marginal recovery and reclaiming $113,000. The slump triggered over $900 million in liquidations as global macroeconomic uncertainty and a poor US jobs report adversely impacted market sentiment. BTC , which traded between $116,000 and $120,000, has fallen nearly 6% from its recent peak. According to data from CoinGlass, approximately $905 million in positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with $823 million accounting for long positions, indicating that investors bet on a further price increase. Several economic and political factors are responsible for the downturn, including a poor jobs report. The US Labor Department released a new job report that failed to live up to expectations. Expectations were so underwhelmed that US President Donald Trump fired the official responsible for publishing the report. The White House also levied a new wave of sweeping tariffs on trading partners, spooking traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Trump also announced that he was ordering multiple nuclear submarines to approach Russian waters in response to threats made by a Russian official earlier in the week. Analysts believe BTC will continue dropping in August and September, potentially falling below $100,000 before surging back in Q4. Marti Technologies Kicks Off Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Marti Technologies has announced it will begin holding Bitcoin as part of a new corporate strategy. The company will initially allocate 20% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin and could expand it to 50% to include other assets, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). The assets will be stored with an institutional-grade custodian that adheres to relevant laws and industry standards. Marti Technologies CEO Oguz Alper Oktem stated that the strategy indicates a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped further into bearish territory on Friday as it fell to a low of $112,792. The flagship cryptocurrency is going through a period of heightened volatility and uncertainty as it struggles to build upward momentum. BTC was trading in a narrow range from $116,000 to $120,000, as it struggled to push above $120,000. Despite this, it held above $118,000 before bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday. BTC remains under pressure, with recent price action suggesting a shift in investor sentiment and long-term investor behavior. According to analysts, derivatives activity is playing a substantial role in current price fluctuations. Market analytics platform CryptoQuant stated that sudden changes in leveraged positions and substantial selling pressure on major centralized exchanges are contributing to the ongoing volatility and bearish sentiment. Market analytics firm Swissblock said that the flagship cryptocurrency’s push to $120,000 stalled, resembling a “failed breakout zone.” The firm called the pullback a pause rather than a breakdown, stating, “Profit-taking is rising—but not as intense as late 2024,” the firm wrote, adding that the effect through July was “enough to cap upside and trigger consolidation. The tone is cooling, not capitulatory. Selling pressure is visible, but not extreme—think cooling, not capitulation.” BTC hit a key trend line support on the daily chart. The next few days will be crucial in determining if the price breaks below this level or bounces strongly off it. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of 119,603 before settling at 117,402. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose over 2% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,982. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, dropping to a low of $117,321 before settling at $118,798, ultimately falling 0.99%. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $118,381. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC plunged to an intraday low of $114,779. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,565. Source: TradingView Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.24% on Saturday and 1.31% on Sunday to reclaim $119,000 and settle at $119,398. The price was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.11% to $118,069. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC registered a marginal decline before dropping to a low of $115,772 on Wednesday. It rebounded from this level to settle at $117,788, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell nearly 2% to $115,800. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $112,793, slipping below a key support level. It rebounded to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,365, ultimately dropping over 2%.

Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Surge to $21M By 2046 With Bitcoin’s sway over Shiba Inu, many are asking how SHIB might react if BTC hits a jaw-dropping target of $21 million. Michael Saylor, a popular Bitcoin maximalist and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (now Strategy), forecasted the $21 million price for BTC. During a keynote address at BTC Prague 2025, he forecasted that Bitcoin will trade at $21 million by 2046, precisely 21 years from now. He highlighted macroeconomic shifts, accelerating adoption, and institutional involvement as key catalysts that could propel Bitcoin to $21 million.Shiba Inu’s Price If Bitcoin Hits $21M Saylor’s $21 million Bitcoin forecast has sparked mixed reactions within the crypto community. In particular, users are debating how Bitcoin’s surge to the $21 million price target might impact the broader crypto market, such as that of Shiba Inu. As a result, we estimated SHIB’s price under the assumption that it grows proportionally if Bitcoin reaches $21 million. Bitcoin is currently trading at $113,800. To reach Saylor’s target of $21 million, Bitcoin must spike by 19,306% from its current trading price. Therefore, assuming Shiba Inu grows in proportion to Bitcoin, it could reach a new all-time high target. To put things into perspective, a 19,306% surge would take Shiba Inu’s price to $0.00225 from the current level of $0.00001261, marking a new all-time high for the canine-themed token. At $0.00225, Shiba Inu’s market cap will also climb to $1.32 trillion from $6.84 billion, assuming SHIB maintains its supply of roughly 589.25 trillion tokens. Can SHIB Hit $0.002 While this analysis looks fascinating, it remains unclear whether Shiba Inu could reach the milestone. Many market commentators, including Davinci Jeremie, believe that SHIB’s substantial supply of over 589 trillion tokens may hinder the asset’s potential surge to lofty heights. Consequently, they recommend that the broader Shiba Inu community burn a substantial portion of the SHIB supply to drive the price to unprecedented levels. Although the need to drastically reduce SHIB’s hefty supply cannot be overemphasized, multiple entities have projected when Shiba Inu’s price might soar to the $0.002 region. According to ChatGPT, Shiba Inu’s price could soar to $0.002 between 2032 and 2034. However, Changelly trading platform predicted that it might take longer before Shiba Inu finally clinches the $0.002 target. Per Changelly, Shiba Inu would trade within the $0.002 region by February 2040, with SHIB expected to reach a maximum target of $0.00229 by then.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-02 14:09:38

TMTG’s net sales this past quarter were $883,300, a value that reflects a 5.5% increase year-over-year, while the net loss was $20 million, a couple of figures higher than the $16.4 million it recorded the same quarter a year ago. TMTG’s assets grew in the second quarter According to a statement from the company, its net loss included non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, as well as interest expense and income taxes. Its operating loss rose to $43.5 million for Q2, but this was partially offset by an interest income of $16.8 million and investment income of $11.1 million. The company’s interest expense was pegged at $4.1 million. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Trump Media ended the second quarter with financial assets of approximately $3.1 billion, representing an approximately 800% year-over-year increase in financial assets. TMTG now looks forward to a future in which this level of liquidity and financial freedom, in conjunction with Trump Media’s low operating costs and low cash burn rate, will fully enable it to pursue its expansion plans, which include enhancing its existing platforms, launching new fintech and financial services products, and pursuing potential mergers and acquisitions. TMTG’s Bitcoin treasury business contributed the most to its balance sheet TMTG identified the ability to raise nearly $2.4 billion for its Bitcoin treasury strategy as the biggest factor that contributed to the growth of Trump Media’s balance sheet. The fundraise was achieved via a private placement offering backed by about 50 institutional investors, according to the company. As things stand, Trump Media has one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries of any public firm, having accumulated approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities in July 2025. Other benefits the treasury strategy has afforded the company include enabling Trump Media to expose its investors indirectly to cryptocurrencies, creating investment income, and helping to position the company for expansion while solidifying its financial freedom and enhancing security against debanking and other acts of political discrimination. Trump owned 114.75 million of TMTG’s outstanding shares through a revocable trust as far back as February. As of the close of market trading on Friday, that stake is worth about $1.9 billion even though TMTG shares are declining year-to-date. Meanwhile, legal costs have been identified as one of the factors that strongly influenced Trump Media’s Q2 results. The legal costs, approximately $15 million, were primarily related to the company’s 2024 merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Digital World Acquisition Corp., to become a publicly traded entity. “The merger resulted in substantial legal costs, including those incurred in litigation aiming to recoup merger-related damages from those individuals and entities that the Company alleges caused the delay of the SPAC through their wrongful acts,” TMTG said. It believes that if the litigation issues are positively resolved, it could significantly impact future financial results. Get seen where it counts.

49425593,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=185306,1754146511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49425593.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Unveiling the Shocking Fall Below $113,000",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-drop-analysis-11/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Unveiling the Shocking Fall Below $113,000 The cryptocurrency market, known for its rapid shifts, recently saw a significant movement as Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below the $113,000 mark. This sudden movement has sparked discussions among investors and analysts alike. For anyone following digital assets, understanding the factors behind such a shift is crucial. This particular Bitcoin Price Drop , as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, saw BTC trading at $112,992.01 on the Binance USDT market. Such a development naturally raises questions about market stability and future trends. What Exactly Happened with the Bitcoin Price Drop? The immediate news that Bitcoin fell below $113,000 quickly circulated across trading desks and investor communities. This threshold is often seen as a psychological or technical support level, and its breach can trigger further market reactions. When a major cryptocurrency like Bitcoin experiences a Bitcoin Price Drop , it is not merely a number change; it reflects underlying market dynamics at play. The reported price of $112,992.01 on Binance’s USDT market highlights a specific point in time where market sentiment shifted, leading to selling pressure that pushed the price down. Monitoring these movements in real-time is essential for traders and long-term holders to gauge market health. Understanding the immediate impact involves recognizing how market participants react. A drop below a key level can lead to: Increased Volatility: Prices can swing more wildly as traders react to the news. Liquidation Events: Leveraged positions might be closed out, adding to selling pressure. Investor Sentiment Shift: Fear can spread, leading some to sell holdings to avoid further losses. Opportunity for Buyers: Conversely, some investors view these dips as opportunities to acquire assets at a lower cost. Why Did We See This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Attributing a precise cause to a Bitcoin Price Drop can be complex, as various factors often converge to influence market movements. While no single event is typically responsible, several elements often contribute to significant price adjustments: Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as inflation data, interest rate decisions by central banks, or geopolitical events, can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets show signs of instability, investors may withdraw from more volatile assets. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding new cryptocurrency regulations from major economies can significantly impact market sentiment. Stricter regulations can be perceived negatively, while clear, supportive frameworks can be positive. Whale Movements: Large transactions by significant holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can move the market. A large sell-off by a whale can create substantial selling pressure, leading to a noticeable Bitcoin Price Drop . Technical Indicators: Traders often rely on technical analysis, using charts and patterns to predict future price movements. If key support levels are broken, or bearish patterns emerge, it can trigger automated selling or encourage traders to exit positions. Market Sentiment and News Cycle: Negative news headlines, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) campaigns, or even a general downturn in positive market narratives can erode confidence and lead to a sell-off. How Does a Bitcoin Price Drop Influence the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization means its price movements often dictate the direction of the broader digital asset market. A significant Bitcoin Price Drop rarely occurs in isolation; it usually sends ripples through the entire ecosystem. This phenomenon is often referred to as Bitcoin’s ‘dominance’ over altcoins. When Bitcoin experiences a downturn, altcoins, which are typically more volatile, often see even more pronounced price declines. This correlation is due to several factors: Liquidity Drain: During times of uncertainty, investors often move capital from altcoins into more stable assets, including stablecoins or even back into fiat currency, leading to a ‘flight to safety’. Psychological Impact: Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for investor confidence. A dip in BTC can lead to a general sense of unease, prompting a wider sell-off across the market. Trading Pairs: Many altcoins are traded against Bitcoin (e.g., ETH/BTC). When BTC’s value drops, the value of altcoins denominated in BTC also effectively decreases, even if their fiat value remains somewhat stable for a brief period. Here is a simplified illustration of how a Bitcoin Price Drop can affect other cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrency Market Cap Contribution Typical Reaction to BTC Dip Bitcoin (BTC) Largest portion Leads the overall market trend Ethereum (ETH) Second largest Often follows BTC, sometimes with higher percentage drops Major Altcoins Significant but smaller Can experience amplified losses compared to BTC Smaller Altcoins Minimal Highly susceptible to large percentage drops Navigating the Volatility: Strategies After a Bitcoin Price Drop A Bitcoin Price Drop can be unsettling, but it also presents an opportunity for informed decision-making. Investors who understand market cycles and employ sound strategies are better positioned to navigate these periods of volatility. Here are some actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy averages out the purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term price swings. HODLing and Long-Term Perspective: For those with a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, a HODLing (holding on for dear life) strategy involves simply holding onto assets through market downturns. Historically, Bitcoin has recovered from significant dips, reaching new all-time highs. Risk Management and Diversification: Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, into other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets, can help mitigate risk during a significant Bitcoin Price Drop . Rebalancing Your Portfolio: A dip can be a good time to re-evaluate your portfolio allocation. If Bitcoin becomes a smaller percentage of your total holdings due to a price drop, you might consider buying more to bring it back to your desired allocation. Conducting Thorough Research: Always do your own research (DYOR). Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Rely on credible sources and avoid making emotional decisions based on fear or hype. Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Setback or a Stepping Stone? Every significant Bitcoin Price Drop ignites a debate: is this the beginning of a prolonged bear market, or simply a healthy correction before the next upward trend? History provides context, but future performance is never guaranteed. Bitcoin has a track record of extreme volatility, experiencing multiple cycles of sharp corrections followed by impressive recoveries. Challenges to Consider: Further Downside: There is always a possibility that the price could fall further before finding a bottom. Market Uncertainty: Regulatory crackdowns, global economic instability, or unforeseen technological issues could continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Potential Opportunities: Discounted Entry: For long-term investors, a significant Bitcoin Price Drop can offer an attractive entry point to accumulate assets at a lower cost.

The crypto market remains a dynamic environment where resilience and informed decision-making are key. Conclusion The recent Bitcoin Price Drop below $113,000 serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when Bitcoin falls below a certain price level? A1: When Bitcoin falls below a significant price level, like $113,000, it often indicates that a key support level has been broken. This can trigger further selling pressure and signal a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish in the short term. It’s a point traders and analysts watch closely. Q2: Is a Bitcoin Price Drop a common occurrence? A2: Yes, price drops are a common occurrence in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has experienced numerous significant corrections and bear markets throughout its history, often followed by periods of recovery and new all-time highs. Q3: How long does a Bitcoin Price Drop typically last? A3: The duration of a Bitcoin Price Drop varies significantly. Some dips are short-lived corrections lasting days or weeks, while others can evolve into prolonged bear markets lasting months or even over a year. There is no fixed timeline, as it depends on a multitude of market factors. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin if there is a price drop? A4: The decision to sell during a Bitcoin Price Drop depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Many long-term investors choose to hold (HODL) or even buy more during dips, while short-term traders might sell to mitigate losses or re-enter at a lower price. It is important to avoid making emotional decisions and to consult with a financial advisor if unsure. Q5: What are the main factors that can cause a Bitcoin Price Drop? A5: A Bitcoin Price Drop can be caused by various factors including negative macroeconomic news, regulatory uncertainty, large sell-offs by major holders (whales), technical analysis indicators signaling a downturn, and overall negative market sentiment or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Q6: Is it possible for Bitcoin to recover from a significant price drop? A6: Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a strong ability to recover from significant price drops, often reaching new all-time highs in subsequent market cycles. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and recovery is never guaranteed. The long-term trajectory depends on continued adoption, technological development, and market demand.

But while XRP steals headlines, a lesser-known rival is quietly gathering whale momentum. This so-called “XRP killer” isn’t just hype—it’s drawing serious interest ahead of ETF speculation. Here’s why XRP’s rally may face stiff competition from the one token built for everyday payments. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Eyes $4 After Surprise Coinbase Dominance Ripple’s XRP just pulled off something unthinkable last year—it beat Ethereum on Coinbase. According to the latest Q2 2025 report, XRP accounted for 13% of all Coinbase transaction revenue, surpassing Ethereum (ETH), which held 12%. Bitcoin led the charge with 34%, but XRP’s rise is what’s getting analysts excited. The momentum is real, and whales are stacking XRP in anticipation of an ETF-driven rally. In the first half of 2025, XRP brought in 16% of Coinbase’s trading income. Ethereum managed only 11%. That stat alone shows just how much sentiment has shifted. The re-listing of XRP in mid-2023 continues to be a major catalyst. Now, with the SEC saga fading, XRP price prediction looks well-positioned to make a clean run toward $4 and beyond. While Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) continue to dominate DeFi headlines, XRP is grabbing serious volume on centralized exchanges. Coinbase’s own treasury still leans heavily toward Bitcoin (BTC), but XRP’s consistent growth is hard to ignore. Whales aren’t waiting around either. Activity on major wallets suggests increased accumulation around the $0.70–$0.80 range. As ETF rumors swirl and the token’s use in global payments rises, XRP could rewrite its own ceiling. XRP Price Today sits just under a breakout zone. Analysts believe a sustained move past $0.90 could trigger a bullish cascade. ETH Price still reflects strong Layer-2 traction, but it’s XRP’s real-world appeal that now leads the headlines. If XRP delivers again in Q3, we might stop calling it a comeback. It could just be dominance returning. Investors Say Remittix Feels Like Ripple’s Consumer Upgrade Remittix is starting to earn a new nickname from crypto circles—XRP 2.0—and it’s not just because it targets fast, low-cost cross-border payments. It’s because it might actually improve on what Ripple started. While XRP pushes for enterprise adoption, Remittix is winning hearts through real-world usability. Its PayFi model offers regular users what big banks don’t: fast crypto-to-cash transfers with no surprise fees. The token’s rise has come at a time when XRP looks poised to break past $4 amid ETF optimism, but whales are already diversifying. According to wallet trackers, accumulation of RTX has jumped 19% in the past week alone. That kind of quiet hoarding often signals insider confidence. Remittix isn’t trying to copy Ripple’s playbook. It’s building a more user-centered one. The upcoming beta launch of the Remittix Wallet on September 15 confirms that product delivery is no longer a promise—it’s happening. Key drivers pushing Remittix forward: 40+ crypto pairs and 30+ fiat currencies supported Instant crypto-to-fiat payments with no KYC required Over $17.92 million raised at $0.0895 per token $250,000 Remittix Giveaway adding strong investor interest As XRP draws headlines for institutional volume, Remittix quietly builds for the retail crowd.

Solana (SOL) continues to anchor portfolios with established infrastructure and high-throughput appeal, but Mutuum Finance is emerging as a disruptive force in the decentralized lending sector. The project is priced at $0.035 in stage 6 of its presale. The 7th phase will see a price appreciation of 14.29% to $0.04. Existing investors expect a return of 71.43% when the token goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has so far raised over $13.9 million in funding and attracted over 14,800 investors. Solana (SOL) Navigates Resistance Ahead of Potential Upside Solana is currently trading around $157–$160, consolidating after attempting to break the $180–$190 resistance zone. Short-term technical models suggest an immediate range between $156 and $178, with support around $162 and resistance near $178. Analysts highlight that reclaiming $165–$170 could pave the way toward $200–$220, especially if key catalysts like ETF approvals and Firedancer scaling upgrades materialize. Ambitious long-term projections place SOL in the $250–$300+ zone by the end of 2025, contingent on sustained ecosystem growth and institutional inflows. As analysts and traders weigh these scenarios, some are also turning attention toward emerging DeFi protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale in Phase 6 with Strong Momentum Mutuum Finance has recently concluded Phase 5 presale and moved on to Phase 6, where tokens are priced at $0.035, an increase of 16.17% from the previous round. The next price increase will bring the value up to $0.04, an increase of 14.29%. The money that has been invested at this point will earn returns of 71.43% when MUTM is hits its launch price of $0.06. So far, presale has drawn over 14,700 unique holders and raised over $13.9 million, reflecting strong and growing interest in the project. Mutuum Finance is a P2P and P2C lending protocol that allows customers to receive high yields and keep complete control over their funds. It’s an end-to-end DeFi experience best suited to the needs of customers and safer, more transparent, and more flexible than centralized lending products. Mutuum Finance Official Giveaway Mutuum Finance has organized a $100,000 giveaway to grow its community. 10 investors have a chance to grab $10,000 tokens of MUTM each. The giveaway not only onboards new investors to the platform, but also demonstrates that the project is willing to take that extra mile in building a long-term and loyal user base. Mutuum Finance Scores 95.0 Trust Score in CertiK Review A CertiK smart contract audit has concluded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to be secure with a trust score of 95.0/100. The platform has a secure environment in which to carry out DeFi activities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is combining state-of-the-art lending capability with the strength of an ecosystem, with a clear path to the future of DeFi. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing an Ethereum-based, fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin. It will be a type of stablecoin that offers long-term liquidity, stability, and dependability to customers of all kinds. Solana (SOL) may reach $300+ by late 2025, but its upside is tied to broader market conditions and institutional growth. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers sharper, earlier returns. At $0.035 in Phase 6, with a launch price of $0.06, current investors can lock in a 71.43% ROI. The next presale phase raises the price to $0.04, so timing matters. Over $13.9 million has already been raised from 14,800+ investors, showing strong momentum. If you’re looking for the token with the biggest upside potential in 2025, secure your MUTM before prices rise.

In his statement on social media, Novogratz argued that the “quadruple top” formation, which is occasionally encountered in technical analysis, is not as much of a bearish signal as it is thought. “I've been trading for a long time and haven't often seen the 'quad top' pattern as a bearish signal. Usually, a slight correction follows, followed by the start of a new uptrend. We're currently trading in the $3,000-$4,000 range. But my instinct is that we'll break $4,000 by the end of the year, not $3,000,” he said. Related News: White House Crypto Advisor Bo Hines Announces Bitcoin News: “Strategic BTC Reserve Efforts Will Accelerate” Novogratz previously told CNBC that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in terms of performance within the next 3-6 months. He attributed this expectation to the growing number of companies holding Ethereum treasuries, and stated that if ETH surpasses the $4,000 level, it will enter a period of “price discovery.” The Galaxy CEO also stated that he has set a price target of up to $150,000 for Bitcoin this cycle, noting that gold, silver, and crypto assets are gaining strength in an inflationary environment. He argued that global factors such as rising inflation in the US, Trump's interest rate cut pressure, and China's new “reflation” policies are supporting this trend. *This is not investment advice.

Today, it’s about how a crypto captures attention, builds meaningful community engagement, and delivers smart incentives. With so many new projects entering the space, only a few are reshaping what it means to stand out. This list features four crypto names making waves in different ways. Leading the pack is BlockDAG, known for its high-stakes 10 BTC Auction and a record-setting presale. 1. BlockDAG: Turning Heads with a 10 BTC Auction Finish BlockDAG has transformed its presale into something much more than a typical fundraising event. Instead of relying on hype or influencer promos, it introduced a 10 BTC Auction to close out its presale, where anyone buying BDAG before August 11 gets a spot in the prize pool. Bigger purchases unlock larger shares of the Bitcoin prize. The numbers show the response. BlockDAG has raised $359 million, sold over 24.6 billion BDAG coins, and moved into Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. That marks a 2,660% gain since Batch 1. Despite this progress, there’s still a limited-time chance to grab BDAG at just $0.0016 via the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With over 20 exchange listings confirmed, plus real-world use through its mining network and strong brand backing via sports deals, BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction is more than a marketing tactic. It sets a new bar. That’s why it easily leads the list of the best long-term cryptos for 2025. 2. Bitcoin Hyper: Speed & Simplicity for Real-World Payments Bitcoin Hyper stands out by tackling the biggest pain points in Bitcoin’s original design, slow transactions and high fees. It’s built for fast, low-cost payments that work in real time. Rather than trying to compete with Bitcoin, it positions itself as a helpful layer for instant payments where speed matters most. What makes it interesting is how simple it feels for users. There’s no complicated process, just fast and smooth transactions, especially useful in places where banking systems are slow or expensive to use. While it’s still in its early stages, Bitcoin Hyper’s clear focus on utility over trading buzz gives it long-term potential. For people seeking real-world value over speculation, it earns a spot on this list of the best long-term cryptos for 2025. 3. Nexchain: Real Interoperability Without the Mess Nexchain is building tools for cross-chain communication, something that crypto has promised for years but rarely delivered without adding extra complexity. It allows users to move assets and data between blockchains without needing third-party bridges. Its strength lies in how it handles transfers at the base protocol level. There’s no need for users to hold multiple assets or jump through technical steps. Nexchain delivers a unified experience for users and developers alike, letting dApps operate across ecosystems without extra friction. As the demand for seamless blockchain integration increases, Nexchain’s clean approach stands out. For anyone focused on infrastructure and developer tools, this project earns a spot among the best long-term cryptos for 2025. 4. Lightchain AI: Bringing Intelligence Into Smart Contracts Lightchain AI is working on something ambitious, embedding machine learning into blockchain infrastructure. Its platform lets developers create smart contracts that react to real-world data rather than relying only on preset commands. This unlocks new use cases, like smart contracts that change based on live market data or supply chains that respond to anomalies instantly. Lightchain AI is already releasing development tools and plans to expand API access soon. It’s not just using AI as a buzzword. Lightchain AI is building tools for actual smart automation. For those watching how artificial intelligence might shape future blockchains, this project could be key. That utility-focused direction makes it one of the best long-term cryptos for 2025. Identifying the Best Long-Term Crypto For 2025 As the next cycle approaches, the market is looking for more than just catchy names. It wants staying power, creativity, and utility. BlockDAG leads by delivering all three through its presale mechanics, community structure, and massive auction-driven momentum, making it the top pick among the best long-term cryptos for 2025 . Meanwhile, Bitcoin Hyper, Nexchain, and Lightchain AI each tackle real gaps in the crypto world. Whether it’s transaction speed, network compatibility, or smarter contracts, these projects show how real use cases drive long-term relevance, not just hype.

After spending over two weeks consolidating in a tight range, BTC has now exited this phase with bearish momentum, raising concerns across the market. Traders and analysts are closely watching to see if Bitcoin can find strong demand around current levels to stabilize the price and prevent a deeper correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Taker Sell Volume Hits $335M In Just 2 Minutes: Panic Or Profit-Taking? Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that Short-Term Holders (STHs) are selling their Bitcoin at a loss, a typical pattern observed during retail capitulation events. Over the past 24 hours, a significant volume of BTC has been sent to exchanges at negative profit margins, signaling that weaker hands are being shaken out of the market. This selling pressure often marks the final stages of a correction phase, where panic-driven exits by STHs create potential accumulation opportunities for long-term investors. The next few sessions will be crucial, as Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $115K level to regain bullish structure. Otherwise, bears may attempt to drive prices lower, targeting the $110K zone. The market now looks for institutional demand or fresh capital inflows to absorb the ongoing retail-driven sell-off and stabilize the price. Short-Term Holders Sell Bitcoin At A Loss According to top analyst Maartunn, over the past 24 hours, 21,400 BTC were sent to exchanges at a loss by Short-Term Holders (STHs). This behavior is typical during Bitcoin drawdowns, where retail investors, driven by fear and emotional reactions to price swings, tend to sell their holdings at a loss. These capitulation events often amplify volatility, as panic selling creates sharp, short-term supply spikes on exchanges. However, despite this surge in loss-driven selling, on-chain data reveals a contrasting narrative among institutional players. The supply of Bitcoin in Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks continues to shrink, suggesting that large investors are actively buying during this correction. This divergence between retail capitulation and institutional accumulation points to a healthy market reset, where weaker hands exit while stronger hands build positions. Bitcoin’s momentum is now shifting from bullish caution to bearish fear. The recent breakdown below $115K raises the probability of further downside, with analysts eyeing the $112K level as a key support area. This level holds historical significance as the previous all-time high (ATH) set in May. If BTC finds strong demand at this zone, it could establish a solid foundation for the next bullish leg. Related Reading: Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index Reaches Bearish Levels: Futures Traders Show Caution BTC Price Analysis: Breakdown Below Key Support Levels Bitcoin (BTC) has broken down from its multi-week consolidation range, currently trading at $113,737 after losing the critical $115,724 support level. The chart shows a clear rejection at the $122,077 resistance zone, where multiple attempts to break higher failed over the past two weeks. This rejection led to an increase in bearish momentum, pushing the price below the 50 and 100-period SMAs, which are now acting as resistance at $117,853 and $114,838, respectively. BTC is now hovering just above the 200-period SMA at $110,308, which could act as a last line of defense for bulls. If this level holds, a potential bounce back to retest the $115K region might occur. However, if the price fails to find strong demand soon, the next downside target sits around $112K, which aligns with the previous all-time high from May.

Despite the bearish technical structure in the short term, broader market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, as institutional accumulation continues in the background. The coming sessions will be critical to determine whether BTC can reclaim $115K or if further downside toward $110K becomes inevitable.

Ripple price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to a low of $2.92 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 1.77 percent of its value. Technical indicators give neutral signals, but the price charts continue to project a bearish market scenario for the day, as XRP corrects from an all-time high. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price down to $2.92 during the day. The RSI decreased to 47.46 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.76 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $24.74 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Teucrium’s XXRP, the leveraged XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched in April, has reached $300 million in net flow. With the ETF reaching $323.6 million in inflows, it becomes the first XRP ETF in the US to reach the milestone. The Teucrium Trading CEO says the leveraged ETF product is its most successful ETF ever. Read more about it here .

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP is trending above $3, as the market sentiment still tilts toward the positive side.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 15:01:00

The scale of the sell-off, equivalent to more than $2.3 billion at current prices, has raised serious concerns about market sentiment and price stability as XRP battles to hold key support levels. Whale Sell-Off Triggers Volatility On-chain data confirms significant XRP outflows from large wallets to centralized exchanges, often a prelude to major sell-offs. The timing of this move coincided with a sharp uptick in XRP liquidations, with over $41 million in long positions wiped out in the derivatives market over the same 24-hour period. These back-to-back events caused ripple effects across XRP trading pairs, briefly pushing the token below the critical $3.00 support zone before a modest rebound. BREAKING #XRP Whales have sold over 719M XRP in the past 24 hours pic.twitter.com/E1e65X1Qi4 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 2, 2025 This isn’t the first time such large movements have raised alarms. Just last week, over 759 million XRP were transferred in two separate whale transactions, including 16.8 million XRP sent directly to Coinbase. While not all whale transfers confirm sales, such activity often reflects preparation for liquidation or strategic repositioning. Mixed Signals from Whale Activity Despite the sell-off, on-chain trends reveal a more intricate landscape. While some whales appear to be cashing out, others are quietly accumulating. Reports from blockchain analytics platforms show that wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million XRP have increased in number over the past two weeks. Since July 27, more than 310 million XRP have reportedly been added to whale holdings, suggesting long-term confidence remains even amid short-term volatility. This divide among large holders, some exiting while others accumulate, underscores the growing uncertainty in the market. XRP’s future, it seems, hinges not just on whale moves but also on broader macroeconomic and regulatory conditions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Outlook and Technical Landscape XRP is currently trading between key levels, with strong resistance at $3.32 and support between $2.90 and $3.00. A breakdown below these levels could trigger further downside toward $2.65, a historically significant demand zone. On the upside, reclaiming and holding above $3.30 could reignite bullish momentum toward the yearly high of $3.65. Traders are closely watching these zones, especially in light of heightened whale activity and rising market volatility. Regulatory Pressure Adds to Uncertainty The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the SEC’s final position on Ripple continues to weigh heavily on XRP’s long-term trajectory. Despite earlier legal victories, such as Judge Torres’ 2023 ruling that XRP sales on exchanges do not constitute securities offerings, regulatory silence has fueled speculation and fear. This backdrop may be influencing some whale decisions to offload tokens, especially amid broader concerns about centralized token control and insider movement. Xaif’s report of 719 million XRP sold in a single day has sent shockwaves through the XRP Army. While such massive sell-offs are often seen as bearish, the broader context reveals a market in transition. Whale behavior is divided, technical levels are under pressure, and regulatory silence continues to cast a long shadow. Still, the resilience of XRP’s core investor base and signs of ongoing accumulation suggest the story is far from over. The community is on high alert, closely monitoring price levels, whale activity, and waiting for market clarity in these pivotal times.

The move has put key support levels at risk, leaving traders questioning whether the recent decline signals deeper trouble—or a setup for a potential rebound. This article breaks down SUI’s current price action and explores which altcoins might shine amid the market’s latest shakeup. Sui (SUI): Price Movement and Growth Potential Source: tradingview The cryptocurrency Sui (SUI) is fluctuating between $3.75 and $4.67. It recently slipped by around 13% within the past week, hinting at a downward trend. Despite this dip, SUI has grown nearly 18% over the last month, showing potential for recovery and growth. The strongest resistance level is at $5, suggesting room for gains. If SUI breaks through this, it could rise to the next level at about $5.91, marking a potential increase of over 25% from current levels. Although SUI’s RSI is below 50, a sign of more sellers than buyers, the coin’s recent performance shows it could still be on a path to recovery. Conclusion Despite the sharp post-unlock drop, SUI’s technical outlook still leaves room for recovery if it can reclaim momentum. Resistance levels above $5 remain achievable targets, but stability at current support is crucial. As the market digests this volatility, SUI and other select assets could offer fresh opportunities for investors watching for the next move upward.

In what he called Operation Chokepoint 3.0, the hedge fund executive claims that major banks represent the next big barrier for the industry. According to him, Operation Chokepoint 2.0, where federal regulators during the Joe Biden administration tried to debank the crypto sector, has already ended. In its place, major banks are now trying to use high fees to limit crypto. He said: “Banks are aiming to implement their own Chokepoint 3.0 — charging insanely high fees to access data or move money to crypto and fintech apps — and, more concerningly, blocking crypto and fintech apps they don’t like.” Rampell referenced JPMorgan Chase’s decision to charge fees from fintech apps for accessing customers’ bank account data as evidence of this claim. The move by JPMorgan has sparked concerns that fintech companies might have to spend hundreds of millions to access customers’ data. This has drawn criticisms from several stakeholders, including Rampell. He noted that JPMorgan is a mega bank worth $800 billion; thus, the decision to charge high fees from fintech platforms is not about generating revenue but rather to strangle the competition. Rampell calls on CFPB to step in Meanwhile, the a16z executive called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to step in and prevent JPMorgan from proceeding with the decision. According to him, US law gives customers the right to their data, and CFPB needs to protect this right. While noting that CFPB made questionable decisions in the last administration, he stated that customer data is a right that must be guaranteed. He added that the data is usually the account number and routing code, usually accessible on every check. However, banks now want to charge higher fees for delivering it electronically. In the executive’s opinion, the higher fees will transfer to customers trying to use the fintech apps or crypto platforms. Thus, they might be forced to stick with the major banks even when those banks are offering crappier services. He added that if CFPB does not stop JPMorgan, other banks will likely do the same thing. He said: “In a perfect world, consumers would vote with their wallets. But every bank will likely do this, and getting a new banking charter takes years. Many banks have hostages, not customers.” With customers likely powerless to make the decision, Rampell, who leads a16z Apps practice, believes the regulatory authority must prevent this move, which will limit consumer choice and kill competition. Meanwhile, advocacy groups such as Public Policy Solutions and Consumer First have also criticized the JPMorgan fees, describing them as a tax on innovation. Banks’ changing approach to crypto as JPMorgan partners with Coinbase Interestingly, the criticism of JPMorgan comes as the bank and Coinbase announced a partnership. The partnership, which Coinbase disclosed a few days after the bank disclosed the increased fees for fintech companies, will allow customers to fund their Coinbase account using Chase credit cards in 2025 By 2026, customers can redeem their credit card reward points for USDC and link their Chase bank accounts to Coinbase. Many people saw the deal as a positive development and a sign that the bank is finally seeing the market opportunity in crypto, noting that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was still very much anti-crypto as early as January 2025. However, experts believe the bank is still playing catch-up to the innovation already happening in the crypto sector. Maartje Bus , the president of the Medici Network, noted JPMorgan’s decision to remove third-party banking aggregator Plaid as the banking rail for its Coinbase relationship.

He argues this new wave of anti-competitive behavior isn’t about profit, but about stifling competition. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) partner Alex Rampell is sounding the alarm on what he’s calling “Operation Chokepoint 3.0” for the crypto industry. This is a new wave of anti-competition tactics allegedly being deployed by major U.S. banks to suppress the rise of fintech and crypto platforms. According to Rampell, while government-led pressure to de-bank crypto firms has eased under the new administration, traditional financial institutions are now taking matters into their own hands. From Government Pressure to Private Sabotage The original “ Operation Choke Point 2.0 ” under the Biden administration saw increased regulatory scrutiny that made it harder for crypto companies to get banking services. It made it harder for them to access banking services.

In the proposal, community member phil_00Llama explained that layer-2 development consumes time. He added that talented developers could benefit Curve Finance more if they focus exclusively on Ethereum development. Layer-2 chains aren’t profitable for Curve Finance According to the forum post, layer-2 chains are not profitable for the protocol, bringing in a mere $1,500 per day. That’s for all layer-2 chains combined. “All the 24 L2s, on which Curve is currently deployed, result in a total of roughly 1,500$ of daily revenue, or 62$ on average per day per L2,” wrote phil_00Llama. He further explained that deploying Curve Finance on layer-2 chains incurs high maintenance costs “due to their fast pace, short-lived nature.” Curve Finance is deployed on approximately 25 EVM-compatible networks, including Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and more. Data from Messari show that over 93% of Curve’s trading fees have come from Ethereum pools since 2020. “Curves’ Ethereum Pools generate on a slow day 28,000$ of revenue, the equivalent of approximately. 450 L2s, given their average revenue,” stated phil_00Llama. Over the past 30 days, Ethereum’s revenue on Curve reached $1.65 million. Other layer-2 chains have collectively contributed around 1% of Curve’s daily revenue. In the proposal specification, phil_00Llama suggested keeping existing operations intact and deleting L2-linked items from developers’ to-do lists. He emphasized that developers should spend more time focusing on Ethereum and working on meaningful projects. “In my opinion, Curve should double down with Ethereum instead, focusing, for example, on broader scrvUSD adoption,” wrote phil_00Llama. The proposal did not gain strong traction from Curve community members , with one reply requesting more background and context. Curve Finance has a total value locked (TVL) of $21.451 billion, ranking it second after Uniswap. In 2025, Curve Finance received $13.26 million in fees and generated $6.62 million in revenue. The protocol recorded a 30-day trading volume of $7.453 billion. CRV is currently trading at $0.8784, up 63.3% compared to last month. This is not the first time a decentralized protocol has considered stopping layer-2 development. Two weeks ago, Marc Zeller, the co-founder of Aave, stated that it would cease Bitcoin Layer-2 BOB development. He added that Aave’s deployments on Soneium, Celo, Linea, zkSync, and Scroll are operating at a loss due to the DAO being “too lenient.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|AAVE|CRV|ETH,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|CRV|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 15:39:05

Real World Asset Tokenization Is Here By giving a real-world asset like a house, car, artwork, collectible item, or season tickets to a sports franchise a blockchain token, cryptocurrency platforms can provide more financial services for users. In fact, various blockchains hosted $24 billion worth of tokenized real-world assets in June 2025, according to a tally posted by Forbes. According to the survey, over 205,000 blockchain users held deeds to some real-world assets with the help of 194 various smart contract issuers. While that’s a large number of vendors to choose from to log real-world property with financial value using the blockchain, number one and two for size in crypto markets are Ethereum and Solana. It’s interesting to note that Ether’s price gained some 30% over the past 30 days, while SOL is up by a slight 5%. But this lag may be an opportunity for altcoin investors to speculate on an undervalued RWA segment within these two digital currency economies. Solana RWA Growth Outpaces Ethereum in Q1 – 2 According to data collected by RWAxyz, a blockchain explorer that focuses on tokenized real-world assets, the total value of all the segment on Solana increased by over +200% year-to-date by mid-July. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s pool of RWAs grew in market value by +81% YTD. That’s certainly impressive growth, driven by increased blockchain adoption and a perceived bull market. But Solana RWAs grew more than twice as fast over the same 28-week period. The RWAxyz data indicates a Solana RWA growth of +200% YTD by mid-July; however, Messari data shows a figure of +140% growth for the year so far, with a total value exceeding $418 million. The US government hopes to support the blockchain industry’s efforts to tokenize real-world assets. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins recently said , “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace.” Solana’s performance this year in meme coins and RWAs is impressive, but a Wall Street-driven demand shock for Ethereum could still hand Ether tokens the edge in 2025’s altcoin price markets.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7388 Market cap $779.26M Trading volume (24-hour) $27.44M Circulating supply 1.05B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.7780 24-hour low $0.7356 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 23.22% 50-day SMA $0.6654 14-Day RSI 50.22 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-day SMA $0.6408 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Both daily and 4-hour charts show intact downtrends. Steady selling pressure is evidenced by declining OBV and negative BoP. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: Sell pressure intensifies for XTZ As seen on the Tezos 1-day price chart for August 2, XTZ has declined sharply to $0.7350, marking an 11% drop that has pushed the price decisively below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.8321. The Bollinger Band configuration reveals a tightening squeeze that typically precedes significant price movement. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD indicator confirms this bearish bias, while the declining On Balance Volume demonstrates persistent selling pressure that has overwhelmed any buying interest. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Downtrend line holds firm as bears maintain control The 4-hour timeframe shows Tezos trading below the 20-day Simple Moving Average at $0.7892, a resistance level that continues to reject multiple bounce attempts. The steep downtrend line from recent highs remains intact and continues to pressure the price structure. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Likewise, the Balance of Power indicator at -0.72 confirms that selling pressure significantly outweighs buying interest. Trading volume has remained steady around 2.85M, suggesting consistent participation in the decline rather than panic selling, which often indicates more methodical distribution. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7366 BUY SMA 5 $0.8010 SELL SMA 10 $0.8446 SELL SMA 21 $0.8247 SELL SMA 50 $0.6654 BUY SMA 100 $0.6402 BUY SMA 200 $0.6408 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7656 SELL EMA 5 $0.7114 BUY EMA 10 $0.6588 BUY EMA 21 $0.6449 BUY EMA 50 $0.6995 BUY EMA 100 $0.8029 SELL EMA 200 $0.8770 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos faces a critical test at the $0.5769 Bollinger Band support level, and failure to hold this zone could trigger acceleration toward the $0.50-0.55 region. At the same time, any meaningful recovery must first reclaim the $0.7892 resistance and then challenge the $0.8321 level to shift the technical structure back to bullish. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it maintained an average price of $0.7232. XTZ kicked off August at $0.7605 and is currently trading around $0.74.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-02 15:55:00

The meetings will begin on August 4 in Berkeley, California, and conclude on December 5 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Cryptocurrency Working Group has launched a series of roundtables in the United States. This initiative, led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, aims to connect with startups with teams of up to 10 people that were founded less than two years ago. The working group will visit 10 U.S. cities to hear from project founders who could not attend the spring consultations in Washington. “We want to hear from people who were not able to travel for the roundtables that took place this past spring in Washington, D.C. and may not have had a voice in past policymaking efforts.The Crypto Task Force is acutely aware that any regulatory framework will have far-reaching effects, and we want to ensure that our outreach is as comprehensive as possible.” said Peirce. The statement said the working group is particularly interested in speaking with representatives of crypto projects that employ 10 or fewer people and were founded less than two years ago. The first event will take place on August 4 in Berkeley, California. In total, there are 10 cities on the schedule: August 4 – Berkeley, California; August 19 – Boston; September 4 – Dallas; September 15 – Chicago; September 25 – New York; October 3 – Irvine, California; October 24 – Cleveland; October 29 – Scottsdale, Arizona; November 12 – New York; December 5 – Ann Arbor, Michigan.

While plenty of names are out there, only a few combine strong activity, growing attention, and a roadmap that stands out. Some names are flying under the radar, while others are making headlines. August looks like a turning point, and one project, in particular, is setting the tone with a packed lineup of news. Here’s a closer look at four crypto names gaining momentum, starting with the one drawing the most buzz. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) BlockDAG is getting closer to August 11, a date marked on many calendars. That’s when everything hits at once: the 10 BTC Auction ends, winners are revealed, and the GLOBAL LAUNCH release begins. The timing has created a wave of interest, with many watching closely as this moment unfolds. So far, BlockDAG has pulled in $359 million, placing it among the biggest presales this cycle. More than 24.6 billion BDAG have been sold, with Batch 29 pricing at $0.0276. That’s a 2,660% climb from where it started. But with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release underway, there’s still access at $0.0016, which may offer much more upside. It’s not just the auction or the launch drawing eyes. BlockDAG (BDAG) has locked in over 20 exchange listings, partnered with U.S. sports teams like the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves, and launched outreach campaigns across crypto and retail spaces. For those wondering about the best crypto to buy in 2025, this project is drawing serious attention ahead of its debut. 2. Hyperliquid (HYPR) Hyperliquid is gaining traction in DeFi circles with its fully on-chain platform for trading derivatives. Unlike others that still use some centralized features, Hyperliquid delivers fast, low-cost, and permissionless trading. This has caught the attention of developers and experienced traders alike. While it doesn’t have the headline presence BlockDAG currently does, its structure and purpose keep it moving forward. The launch of its native asset HYPR has added fuel to the conversation, especially with growing activity on the platform. Governance options and rewards are attracting more users, and many are watching to see how it holds up as larger participants explore the ecosystem. It’s a more complex setup, but one that appears stable. For those asking what is the best crypto to buy in 2025 from a DeFi perspective, Hyperliquid is one of the names that stands out. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano remains one of the most closely followed platforms for its research-first and secure blockchain design. Lately, its Chang Hard Fork has sparked fresh attention. This upgrade supports the network’s goal of decentralization and could open new options for builders. Even though ADA’s price has held steady, the long-term roadmap keeps winning support from its committed base. What gives Cardano added relevance now is growing usage on the network. From more DeFi activity to a rise in transactions, things are picking up. Bigger players are also showing renewed interest, which could support an upward trend in the near future. While BlockDAG has the current momentum, Cardano’s steady delivery keeps it in the mix when thinking about the best crypto to buy in 2025 for long-term value. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains a standout as the original meme coin. Even years after its launch, it still gets attention from both casual traders and public figures. While it started off as a joke, Dogecoin is now part of the larger crypto conversation, with strong exchange support, brand power, and a massive online following. It may not offer much on the tech side, but the loyalty behind it is unmatched. DOGE price swings are often driven by trends and headlines, which makes it a higher-risk option. But it remains in the top ranks by market cap, and even small announcements can drive it upward. For those exploring the best crypto to buy in 2025 with a focus on hype and momentum, Dogecoin still plays a part, especially for short-term moves. What Stands Out in the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025 Each of these names brings something different. Dogecoin brings buzz. Cardano sticks to strong plans. Hyperliquid focuses on advanced tools for traders. But BlockDAG is doing something that combines outreach, timing, utility, and strong support into one focused launch. With the 10 BTC Auction, a $359 million presale, and the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, attention continues to grow around BDAG. If the question is what is the best crypto to buy in 2025 , the answer depends on what you value most. Still, BlockDAG is building a solid case for being at the top of that list.

Shiba Inu has surged forward. Ethereum keeps pulling institutional money. Yet among these recognized players, Pepeto is quietly establishing significant presence within its niche market space. Currently valued at $0.000000144, Pepeto’s initial offering has secured over $5.8M, with the $6M benchmark nearly reached. This level of early investor commitment doesn’t materialize without substantial confidence from participants who recognize genuine opportunity. Here’s where market dynamics become truly captivating. Dogecoin vs. Pepeto: Established Legacy vs. Emerging Opportunity Dogecoin has demonstrated consistency during recent market cycles. Trading ranged from $0.2163 to $0.2477, meeting resistance at the higher threshold. Market specialists anticipate progression toward $0.2608 before August concludes, with a reasonable 2025 price range of $0.220 to $0.320. This suggests roughly 40–45% potential gains. The outlook appears solid. However, Pepeto’s market dynamics operate differently. Beginning from $0.000000144, even modest advancement can produce significant percentage increases. Reaching $0.000005 during 2025 would yield approximately 34x returns, without requiring aggressive market projections. Dogecoin brings proven heritage. Pepeto offers untapped growth space. Shiba Inu vs. Pepeto: Market Scale vs. Entry Advantage Shiba Inu delivered outstanding July results. Price action leaped from $0.0000117 to $0.0000160 before stabilizing around $0.0000128–0.0000130. Major stakeholders showed activity, purchasing 1.81 trillion SHIB tokens during mid-month, while capital flows experienced a dramatic 25,000% increase afterward. Market enthusiasm is clear, yet SHIB’s future growth follows gradual progression. Pepeto, remaining in offering phase, provides early-access advantages SHIB cannot match. The difference represents acquiring tokens with established limitations versus purchasing assets before mainstream exchange availability. Ethereum vs. Pepeto: Market Foundation vs. Growth Rate Ethereum continues serving as a market pillar. After rising from $2,403 earlier this year to $3,800, ETH currently challenges resistance levels at $3,840–$3,940. Fund investments have surpassed $1.5B, solidifying ETH’s position as the institutional preference. Yet Ethereum’s advancement pattern remains measured rather than explosive. Pepeto’s growth pathway, currently, stays uncharted. Even conservative movement toward $0.000005–$0.000007 could exceed ETH’s anticipated gains by considerable margins. PEPETO, ETH, and SHIB 2025 Price Return Snapshot Asset Current Price ($) Realistic Target ($) Multiplier (x) $10,000 Investment ($) Pepeto 0.000000144 0.000005 34.7 347,222.22 Dogecoin 0.2190 0.320 1.46 14,600.00 Shiba Inu 0.0000128 0.000030 2.34 23,400.00 Ethereum 3,800 5,500 1.44 14,400.00 These calculations represent practical forecasts derived from historical market trends and current strategic positioning. Pepeto: From Meme Token to Meme Infrastructure Traditional meme tokens typically launch and finish with social buzz. They depend on community conversations, brief price rallies, and viral campaigns for ongoing relevance. Pepeto has selected a different development route. Instead of merely establishing itself as another meme token, it’s developing comprehensive infrastructure supporting its token ecosystem. Pepeto’s trading platform enables meme coin listings without fees, creating affordable trading spaces for market users. Its network bridge tackles a widespread issue—liquidity fragmentation—by linking meme tokens across different blockchain systems. Staking rewards add extra value. Providing returns above 255% annually, the project doesn’t just encourage trading activity; it promotes sustained community engagement. Over 32 trillion PEPETO tokens currently participate in staking, demonstrating early investor commitment rather than quick profit-taking strategies. An Initial Offering That Maintains Progress Initial offerings typically serve as confidence measurements. Investors examine potential warning indicators. They assess whether projects can sustain interest throughout extended timeframes. Pepeto has exceeded these standards; it continues building remarkable momentum. At $0.000000144, the offering phase remains reachable, though the $6M target approaches fulfillment. This period provides a unique access window before major exchange listings eliminate advantages between early investors and general market participants. Staking reward systems contribute additional consistency. Pepeto will distribute 32,015,981.73 PEPETO per ETH block across two years, delivering holders steady returns that support the token’s development curve. The Tokenomics Driving Pepeto Pepeto’s tokenomics emphasize strategic distribution. From 420 trillion total tokens, 30% supports the offering phase, ensuring equitable early investor participation. Another 30% backs staking programs, where participants receive over 255% annual returns. More than 32 trillion tokens already engage in staking, reflecting strong early community backing. Marketing claims 20% allocation to boost Pepeto’s market recognition. Liquidity receives 12.5% to ensure smooth trading when exchange listings begin. The remaining 7.5% supports development efforts, financing platform enhancements and additional capabilities for Pepeto’s exchange and network bridge systems. This framework maintains project sustainability, benefits token holders, supplies growth funding, and ensures market liquidity. Joining Pepeto involves straightforward steps. First, create a compatible wallet. Metamask functions well for desktop usage. Best Wallet provides ease for mobile applications. Next, fund the wallet using ETH, USDT, or BNB. Card payment methods are available for added convenience. Finally, connect your wallet, select your desired PEPETO amount, and complete the purchase. You can immediately begin staking and earning returns while the offering remains active. Explore Pepeto at https://pepeto.io/ today! Bottom Line Dogecoin maintains its devoted community. Shiba Inu enjoys large investor support. Ethereum possesses institutional backing. Pepeto provides what none deliver: early access paired with genuine utility. At $0.000000144 with nearly $6M raised, Pepeto occupies the position where major cryptocurrency success stories typically begin: before widespread market recognition occurs.

This time, investor attention is veering away from speculative hype and toward platforms showing real potential for consistent returns. One of the most compelling examples of this shift is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a protocol that has early adopters expecting gains reminiscent of the meteoric rises of Aave and Compound during their initial stages. The Next Aave? Mutuum Finance Taps into Real Yield and Early Compounding Advantage Back in the early DeFi boom, protocols like Aave and Compound captured investor attention by turning idle assets into high-yield machines through decentralized lending and borrowing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters this same category—but with more refined economics, real-time adaptability, and a focus on sustainable, long-term growth. The project doesn’t rely on hype alone. It is structured around revenue generation from borrower fees, dynamically adjusted APYs for lenders, and mtTokens that compound in value as interest accrues. At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its pooled contract lending system. Users who supply blue-chip assets like Ethereum (ETH) to the protocol receive mtTokens—yield-bearing assets that represent both the initial deposit and the interest earned. These mtTokens can also be staked or used within the Mutuum ecosystem for further utility. The interest lenders receive is determined by real-time pool utilization rates, meaning APYs adjust based on market supply and demand. This ensures that the ecosystem remains efficient and continuously incentivized. Borrowers, on the other hand, access funds by locking assets like ETH, USDC, or other stablecoins as collateral. Each loan is overcollateralized, minimizing protocol risk while giving users access to capital without having to sell their holdings. With flexible repayments and no fixed schedules, borrowers can repay when it suits them, while lenders continue to earn until the loan is cleared. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently live, with tokens priced at $0.035. Over 14,700 holders have already participated, and more than $13.7 million has been raised so far. With only 7% of the current 170 million token allocation sold, early buyers are eyeing the next price hike to $0.040 in Phase 7—a 15% jump that will only accelerate FOMO. Investors who secured MUTM at $0.01 in Phase 1 have already seen their positions increase to $42,000 from a $15,000 commitment—an indicator of how quickly this token is building momentum. Long-Term Positioning, Big Exchange Momentum, and Compounding Returns Ahead What gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the strength to outperform in the next altcoin cycle isn’t just its utility—it’s the full-stack DeFi infrastructure combined with a vision for liquidity and scalability. As the platform prepares to launch its beta version at listing, it plans to integrate a Layer-2 network to drastically reduce gas fees and accelerate transaction speeds. Moreover, the decentralized stablecoin in development will introduce new dimensions to borrowing and collateral dynamics, minted only during active loans and burned upon repayment. This level of supply control will set the stage for long-term sustainability. MUTM tokens will also feed back into the ecosystem through a smart dividend structure. Protocol revenue from borrower interest fees will be used to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. These tokens are then distributed to users who stake their mtTokens in designated smart contracts, rewarding them with additional income and further compounding their initial investment. As centralized exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, or Kraken explore listing projects with real DeFi utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to ride the next wave of adoption. With a listing price of $0.06 on the horizon and projections of post-launch valuations spiking beyond $0.70 as the cycle matures, investors entering during the current presale phase could see 10x to 14x returns within a realistic timeline. Security also plays a central role in the project’s roadmap. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a comprehensive audit by CertiK, scoring 95.00 on Token Scan and 78.00 on Skynet. A $50,000 bug bounty campaign remains active to further strengthen protocol resilience. For community engagement, over 12,000 followers are tracking updates via Twitter, and a $100,000 giveaway is ongoing, where ten lucky winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. As investor confidence continues to rise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a credible, compliant, and revenue-generating protocol—tailored to meet the demands of the next DeFi wave. Those positioning now at $0.035 are not only securing a favorable entry but are also stepping into a system designed to deliver real returns as the 2026 supercycle ignites.

BlockDAG, Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Tron (TRX) are four names showing strong activity this quarter. Each is playing a different role, some are expanding business use, some are reshaping how networks grow, and others are drawing attention due to how accessible they’ve become. For anyone looking beyond short-term spikes, these projects offer clues to what might perform well going forward. Here’s a closer look at why these names are leading among today’s top crypto gainers. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Entry Pricing and Ecosystem Activity Draw Ongoing Interest BlockDAG continues to gain attention for how it’s shaping early crypto entry points. So far, $359 million has been raised, and 24.6 billion BDAG have been sold across 28 presale rounds. But the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release still allows entry at $0.0016 per coin until August 11. With a projected launch price of $0.05, that means a 3,025% gain for those who get in before that deadline. Activity behind the scenes backs this up: over 200,000 holders, 4,500 developers working on 300+ Web3 projects, and 2.5 million daily miners using the X1 app. Some analysts believe BlockDAG (BDAG) may hit $1 soon after launch, with longer-term possibilities reaching $10 or $20. While it’s still in early stages, demand is rising fast. Each new batch closes at a higher price, which reduces future entry margin. 2. Binance Coin (BNB): Signs of Shift as Big Firms Take Positions When major corporations start adding digital assets to their holdings, the market usually responds. Binance Coin (BNB) recently saw two publicly traded US companies each allocate over $500 million into BNB, highlighting growing interest from institutional players. The current price sits around $830.74, reflecting an 8.6% gain in the last seven days. It briefly touched its all-time high of $861.20 before easing back slightly. BNB’s value goes beyond its original function for trading discounts. Its presence is expanding into corporate treasury use cases. With talk of BNB possibly crossing the $1,000 mark by year-end, its role among the top crypto gainers is becoming more defined. As institutional capital tends to influence broader market behavior, BNB is now a name to watch closely. 3. Cardano (ADA): Whale Transfers and Payment Access Raise Attention Cardano (ADA) experienced a weekly drop of more than 10%, now trading around $0.79, but price is only part of the picture. A large holder recently moved 271 million ADA, valued at approximately $218 million, from exchanges to personal wallets. This may reflect longer-term planning rather than short-term movement. Technologically, ADA made progress with Apple Pay integration, creating a new channel for global access and future use. Even with its recent price dip, this mix of behind-the-scenes whale activity and broader user reach positions ADA among today’s top crypto gainers. 4. Tron (TRX): Mixing Traditional Finance With Blockchain Goals Tron (TRX) is moving in ways that connect crypto with mainstream finance. After Tron Inc. appeared on Nasdaq, the group announced plans to deploy $1 billion through new financial offerings. It currently holds more than 365 million TRX on its balance sheet. This week, TRX traded at $0.3236, reflecting a 2.9% increase, and has overtaken Cardano in market capitalization. What stands out is how Tron is entering regulated financial markets while still advancing its on-chain development. This blend of traditional reach and decentralized goals places it firmly among the best crypto coins in the market today. Summary: What These Top Crypto Gainers Signal BNB is gaining traction through corporate moves, ADA is seeing strong wallet activity and global payment upgrades, and Tron is linking crypto with Wall Street moves. Then there’s BlockDAG, offering $0.0016 entry ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, with deep developer backing and growing user activity. It hasn’t yet entered open market trading, but the pace and structure behind it are hard to ignore. Each of these top crypto gainers reflects a different direction the market could take, but BlockDAG remains priced like it’s still early in the story.

49428204,https://timestabloid.com/?p=76566,1754150425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Will Go Parabolic Once It Breaks This Red Zone,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-will-go-parabolic-once-it-breaks-this-red-zone/,"XRP is once again knocking on the door of a critical resistance zone, and according to respected crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO, a decisive break above this level could trigger a parabolic rally. In a recent post, the analyst highlighted a clearly defined “red zone” between the $3.30 and $3.60 levels, a long-standing ceiling that has repeatedly capped XRP’s momentum. A breakout above this zone, he claims, would likely propel XRP into a steep, accelerated price surge. Red Zone: A Critical Barrier The red zone illustrated on STEPH IS CRYPTO’s chart represents one of XRP’s most formidable areas of historical resistance. The token has repeatedly tested this range over the past few months, but has been rejected each time. The latest test in July 2025 saw XRP tap just above $3.60 before retreating . This consistent rejection underscores the strength of this price ceiling, but also highlights the explosive potential should it finally give way. Once we break the red zone. #XRP will go parabolic. pic.twitter.com/aEFEVaADsS — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 2, 2025 Technical analysis confirms this range as a multi-year supply zone, with previous attempts to break through leading to sharp corrections. However, the current price structure, marked by a higher low and tighter consolidation, suggests XRP may be building the momentum necessary to break out convincingly. Technical Indicators Align Several bullish signals support the possibility of a breakout. On the 3-day chart, XRP continues to hold above key support levels around $2.90 and $3.00, despite recent whale-driven volatility. Key momentum indicators like RSI and MACD are trending upward, signaling growing buying pressure. Additionally, a double-bottom reversal pattern that formed earlier in 2025 remains active, with a projected target of around $4.42, contingent on a successful breakout above the red zone. This aligns closely with Fibonacci extension targets and previous price action dating back to XRP’s historic rallies. Parabolic Rally Expectations If XRP breaks above the red zone and holds it as new support, analysts believe the token could enter a parabolic phase. This type of rally is characterized by rapid, vertical price movement driven by momentum, FOMO, and technical confirmation. Possible targets include the $5.00–$6.50 range in the short term, with longer-term projections stretching significantly higher, depending on broader market conditions and investor sentiment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such a move would not be unprecedented. XRP has historically demonstrated the capacity for explosive growth once key resistance zones are breached. The 2017 and 2021 rallies both followed similar breakout patterns. Market Context and Investor Sentiment This potential breakout comes amid a wave of renewed optimism in the XRP ecosystem. Legal clarity following Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC, anticipation of future ETF listings, and growing institutional interest all add fuel to the bullish narrative. On-chain metrics also show sustained accumulation at lower levels, with whale wallets continuing to absorb supply on dips. Nevertheless, caution remains warranted. Failure to break the red zone convincingly could lead to another pullback, possibly toward $2.60 or even $2.40. Volume confirmation will be key to validating any breakout attempt. As STEPH IS CRYPTO aptly points out, XRP is at a make-or-break moment. The red zone around $3.30 to $3.60 has proven to be a stubborn barrier, but it may also be the gateway to XRP’s next explosive move. Should it be broken with conviction, a parabolic rally may follow, potentially rewriting the altcoin’s price history once again. Until then, all eyes remain on the chart.

In a recent post on social media platform X, fintech analyst Armando Pantoja argued that the notion of market capitalization limiting XRP’s rise to $1,000 is fundamentally flawed. His comment came alongside a short video clip in which he draws comparisons between crypto and early-stage technology companies like Microsoft. Why Market Cap Doesn’t Cap Technology In his video, Pantoja dismissed the idea among many investors that XRP’s market cap should be used as a rigid barrier against long-term price appreciation to the $1,000 price level. He noted that while technical analysis may be useful in the short term, it becomes less relevant when evaluating a token’s potential over an extended period. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP’s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated To drive his point home, he invoked a hypothetical scenario from the early 1990s, asking viewers to imagine those who doubted Microsoft’s growth because of its market cap. That kind of logic, he suggested, would have missed the wave of mass adoption driven by Microsoft. Pantoja insisted that applying stock market valuation metrics to crypto leads to misunderstandings, especially since tokens like XRP are more akin to technologies than companies. “Always the market cap is too high. What does that matter? It’s the technology that’s going to be adopted regardless,” he said. This means that XRP is expected to follow a different trajectory, one based more on network usage, utility, and long-term integration into global systems. This, in turn, would see increased demand for XRP and cause its price to barrel to $1,000. Community Reactions: XRP Battling With Momentum It is easy to point to the mathematical implications of XRP reaching $1,000, a valuation that would place its market cap in the tens of trillions. However, supporters like Pantoja counter that such thinking is based on outdated comparisons. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Now In Wave 4 — What To Expect As such, it is not surprising that Pantoja’s post has resonated well within the XRP community, especially among those who believe the token has far more room to grow than mainstream narratives allow. Nonetheless, the post also attracted some dissenters from those who believe that the price projection may be too high. Rather than focusing on circulating supply or market cap figures, Pantoja argued that long-term XRP valuation will hinge on the real-world adoption of its underlying technology. XRP, through its cross-border use cases, will undoubtedly gain much traction among banks and institutions, especially once the SEC-Ripple lawsuit is finally over. Interestingly, the $1,000 price target is more of a general consensus among a few other crypto analysts. BarriC, a crypto commentator, also posted on the social media platform X that there is a clear path for XRP to first move through $4, then $10 to $20, surpass $100, and finally reach $1,000. He frames it as a multi-stage trajectory based on institutional adoption and XRP’s infrastructure role in cross‑border payments. Dom Kwok, a former Goldman Sachs analyst and co‑founder of EasyA, projected long‑term targets stretching as high as $1,000 by 2030, also contingent on mass adoption. Anders, another XRP proponent, also floated $1,000 as a possible long‑term ceiling in comparison to Bitcoin’s potential of hitting the $1million target.

33767162,[object Object],1754150441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Maxi Blasts XRP Investors With ‘Retarded’ Tag Amid Price Drop,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-maxi-blasts-xrp-investors/,"Bitcoin maxi, FiatHawk criticized XRP investors, following a suggestion that the altcoin could rally to $10,000. This comes amid the recent drop below the psychological $3 level as part of the broader crypto market decline . XRP Holders Are “Truly Retarded” In an X post , FiatHawk remarked that XRP is the crypto for the truly retarded. This came as he shared a message about a potential investor mentioning how they could invest $300 in the altcoin now and watch it grow exponentially as XRP rallies to $10,000 , as experts have predicted. The investors added that this would amount to $1 million on the initial $300 investment. Following FiatHawk’s post, a crypto community member noted that a price tag of $10,000 would put XRP’s market cap at $593 trillion. They added that this is 191x Apple’s current market cap of $3 trillion. Meanwhile, a community member, Billiam, said that the statement about XRP hitting $10,000 can’t be real. The Bitcoin maxi then replied, saying that the altcoin’s current market cap confirms that the “world is full of retards.” Another community member said that XRP investors are not retarded but simply “cheap.” They further stated that these investors lost the chance to buy Bitcoin but wished they were invested in the flagship crypto. FiatHawk responded that Sats are cheap but XRP is “incredibly expensive and overvalued.” Amid FiatHawk’s criticism, it is worth noting that several XRP community members have predicted that the altcoin could rally to $10,000 at some point. Edward Farina, Head of Social Adoption at XRP Healthcare, once proposed a scenario where the altcoin could reach this target if it replaces the SWIFT network, thanks to Ripple’s payment operations. Crypto analyst ‘Random Crypto Pal’ had also predicted that the XRP price could rally to $10,000. He declared that the altcoin’s market cap would no longer have limits once the Ripple and SEC lawsuit concludes. XRP Suffers Price Drop The XRP price dropped below the psychological $3 level on August 1 as the crypto market crashed on the back of new Trump tariffs , which would take effect from August 7. Although the altcoin has reclaimed this psychological level, it looks likely to suffer further declines, especially with the current market uncertainty. In an X post , crypto analyst Ali Martinez said that the XRP price could find support around the $2.55 to $2.40 range. This was the major resistance that the altcoin first broke above before it recorded its rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of around $3.6 last month. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto suggested that the altcoin could at least drop to $2.65 before it continues its next leg up. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Ali Martinez|Altcoin|bitcoin|Coinmarketcap|Edward Farina|Egrag Crypto|FiatHawk|Random Crypto Pal|ripple|Ripple and SEC Lawsuit|US SEC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-02 16:00:41

Although Schwartz has not operated XRPL infrastructure in years, he believes now is the right time to contribute directly. Schwartz, who recently reaffirmed his loyalty to Ripple Labs , said he is starting with what he sees as the network’s top need: a strong and dependable hub. A Fresh Commitment to the Network In a recent post shared on X , Schwartz outlined his thoughts on what the XRP Ledger could benefit from most. He stressed the need to build a dedicated server that serves as a central point. This server would connect key components like validators, hubs, and application servers. The goal, according to Schwartz, is not just to strengthen the network but also to better understand how it performs in real-world conditions. He plans to deploy a server in a New York data center using Ubuntu. It will feature advanced hardware like a powerful AMD processor, large memory, and fast SSD storage. The focus will be on uptime and performance, with the server operating as a production-grade system. Though the project is entirely separate from Ripple as a company, it is a personal initiative Schwartz believes can offer helpful insight into XRPL’s operations. He also noted one potential weakness, which is the use of a single hub. However, he explained that this is intentional, as it allows him to observe performance trends without affecting the stability of the network. He added that no risky experiments will be conducted unless there is an urgent and unusual reason to do so. XRPL Activity Reaches New Highs Schwartz’s renewed involvement comes at a time when XRP Ledger is already seeing stronger adoption than ever. Data from Dune Analytics shows that more people and institutions are using the platform for large transactions. Over the past month, the ledger processed 70 million new transactions, pushing the total number to nearly 4 billion. This came after XRPL added a new feature that allows multiple transactions to be carried out at once in a single bundle. Last week, the XRP Ledger handled 13.5 million transactions. On average, it processes about 1.8 million transactions every day, making it one of the busiest blockchains in the world. This jump in activity indicates that more people are using XRPL for money transfers, particularly with stablecoins. Stablecoins Drive Institutional Interest A significant portion of this growth is attributed to stablecoins. In July, Braza Bank put out over $4 million of its digital currency, called BBRL, on the XRP Ledger. Another stablecoin, RLUSD, also became more popular . Its daily transactions went up from around 5,000 to over 12,000 in just one month. These developments suggest that financial institutions are beginning to view XRPL as a serious platform for tokenized assets and cross-border settlements.
