Investors and analysts alike are scrutinizing XRP, Solana, Aptos, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as each faces pivotal hurdles that could define their trajectory in the weeks ahead. Can they break through resistance and lead the next leg of the crypto bull run? XRP’s Legal Clarity May Be the Fuse for a Breakout XRP’s near-term trajectory is largely tied to its ongoing legal standoff with the SEC, which may finally be approaching resolution. The latest joint motion filed on June 12 hints at a potential settlement, and prediction markets now place an 88% probability on a spot XRP ETF approval by year’s end. If granted, institutional inflows could surge, with forecasts reaching up to $8 billion. Beyond the legal drama, XRP is increasingly being positioned as a serious player in global payments. Ripple leadership has set sights on capturing up to 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume—a bold ambition, but one that signals confidence in XRP’s real-world utility. Meanwhile, XRP’s expanding DeFi footprint—such as Coinbase’s integration of wrapped XRP borrowing—is drawing fresh attention. Solana: ETF Optimism and Network Upgrades Support the Bull Case Solana’s momentum slowed recently amid a cooldown in speculative activity, but core metrics remain resilient. Trading just below resistance in the $165–$170 range, SOL’s near-term breakout potential hinges on two catalysts: the Firedancer upgrade and a pending SEC decision on a spot ETF. With Firedancer expected to dramatically boost Solana’s throughput, and a 91% estimated approval probability for its ETF application, the outlook is cautiously bullish. Analysts believe SOL could hit $220–$250 by year’s end if these factors align. Further strengthening the case is continued enterprise and institutional interest. Societe Generale’s launch of its USD CoinVertible stablecoin on Solana is a key validation of its growing ecosystem maturity, especially as traditional finance experiments with on-chain deployment. Aptos Building Quiet Strength Through Ecosystem Expansion Aptos has been quietly carving out a stronger position through a mix of acquisitions, tech upgrades, and high-profile integrations. The recent purchase of HashPalette opens doors in the Japanese market, while Chainlink, Stripe, and USDC integrations have enhanced the protocol’s utility and developer appeal. The unveiling of “Zaptos,” a pipelined blockchain architecture designed for low-latency and high throughput, adds another layer of innovation. Aptos is now actively competing with faster blockchains in gaming, DeFi, and payments. Momentum is also visible in its DeFi growth—DEX volumes recently set new records, and Aave’s deployment on Aptos testnet shows the protocol is gaining trust among major DeFi players. A pending U.S. ETF and new institutional partnerships, including support from Franklin Templeton, hint at a broader shift toward Aptos as a viable long-term bet. Why Analysts See an Asymmetric Upside Opportunity For MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines as one of the fastest-growing Project in 2025. Backed by a strong community and a scarcity-driven supply model, the project is quickly emerging as a strategic alternative for capital rotation. MAGACOIN’s locked 170 billion token supply—free from VC unlocks—has resonated with retail and crypto-native investors. The project has passed an independent smart contract audit (HashEx), and its current presale stage is seeing fast organic accumulation. Now, analysts are projecting the coin will continue the rally, projecting up to 100x ROI, and a major marketing rollout underway, MAGACOIN is being actively considered not in terms of legacy status, but in terms of future upside. Some analysts argue capital is already rotating into MAGACOIN from blue-chip altcoins, drawn by its early-stage narrative and structurally bullish setup. Final Thoughts: Rotation, Resistance, and the Road Ahead The common thread tying XRP, Solana, Aptos, and MAGACOIN is the convergence of growing futures activity, investor optimism, and powerful narratives—be it legal clarity, technological innovation, or explosive community-driven momentum. XRP and Solana are sitting on ETF-related powder kegs that could ignite massive inflows. Aptos continues to impress with quiet but deliberate expansion and infrastructure growth. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN stands out as a rising star—early in its lifecycle, yet already commanding serious attention across retail and analyst circles alike.

He argues that relying on a fiat currency he views as shaky makes little sense when a more stable asset exists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight His comments have reignited a long‑running debate about what should sit behind digital coins that promise a steady peg. Schiff Questions Fiat Backing According to Schiff, it makes no sense to support a token pegged to a currency that can be inflated away. “I get Bitcoin, but not US dollar stablecoins,” he wrote in a social media post. He pointed out that fiat money can be printed in large amounts, while gold has a fixed supply and centuries of use as money. Schiff said gold cannot be easily devalued by inflation or reckless monetary policies. I get Bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins. If you’re going to introduce a third party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold? You get the same liquidity, but you also get a real store of value. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 19, 2025 Gold‑Backed Tokens On The Rise Based on reports, gold‑backed stablecoins are seeing more interest from investors worried about inflation and dollar weakness. Tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG) let users move digital claims on physical gold. These assets give the same quick transfers and high liquidity as dollar‑pegged coins but tie each token to real metal stored in vaults. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies Regulators across the globe are racing to establish precise regulations for stablecoin reserves. Congress members in the US are considering tighter reserve and audit requirements. Europe and Asia are creating their own regulations to achieve transparency and safeguard users. Schiff’s call for gold introduces additional context to these discussions. It could lead regulators to explore whether commodities can serve as backing for tokens under particular regimes. Market Reaction Mixed According to reports, Schiff’s tweet trended, garnering over 500,000 views within 24 hours. Crypto naysayers applauded his observation on fiat risk. Other investors cautioned that gold-backed tokens have higher fees and cumbersome custody expenses. They explained that transferring metal or establishing physical reserves introduces friction when compared with exchanging dollar-backed coins at a bank custodian. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free—Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Investors also pointed out that stablecoins are widely used in lending, trading and payments within DeFi platforms. Dollar‑pegged tokens like USDC and USDT dominate these flows because they tie directly into existing banking rails. Gold‑backed coins, by contrast, tend to be held as digital bullion rather than spent on everyday transactions.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.325 Market Cap $514.67M Trading Volume $19.34M Circulating Supply 1.58B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.3032 24-hour High $0.3386 24-hour Low $0.3232 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.42% 50-Day SMA $0.3953 14-Day RSI 36.93 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.4629 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis: FLOW remains bearish TL;DR Breakdown FLOW appears to be bearish. The MACD is negative, and the volume is low. The $0.323 support level remains critical. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW shows sustained bearish pressure As of June 21, the 1-day FLOW/USDT chart shows sustained bearish pressure. The price has dropped to $0.325, losing nearly 3% on the day. The 20-day SMA sits above at $0.359, clearly acting as resistance, and the price continues to post lower highs and lower lows. FLOW The MACD remains in negative territory, and the Balance of Power is deeply negative at -0.56, signaling that sellers are dominating. Support is currently found near $0.323, a level that briefly held today; if broken, a drop toward $0.315 could follow. Resistance is at $0.339, where the last short-term high was rejected. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: Bearish pressure holds still On the 4-hour chart, the short-term price action also reflects a downtrend. Bollinger Bands are wide, and price action is hugging the lower band, a sign of continued downward pressure. The candles are unable to hold gains above $0.330, and the price remains below the mid-band SMA at $0.339. Bearish pressure holds still Notably, On-Balance Volume (OBV) is declining, now at -41.32M, reinforcing the view that selling pressure outweighs buying interest. Even though a small green candle has appeared near $0.325, it’s not yet a confirmed reversal as momentum is still weak. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3470 SELL SMA 5 $0.3584 SELL SMA 10 $0.3594 SELL SMA 21 $0.3696 SELL SMA 50 $0.3953 SELL SMA 100 $0.3948 SELL SMA 200 $0.4629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3694 SELL EMA 5 $0.3753 SELL EMA 10 $0.3776 SELL EMA 21 $0.3843 SELL EMA 50 $0.4228 SELL EMA 100 $0.4937 SELL EMA 200 $0.5719 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW remains under strong selling pressure across both daily and 4-hour timeframes. Unless it breaks above $0.339, any small bounce is likely temporary. Right now, the trend is still downward, and the price could slip further if it fails to hold above $0.323. Momentum and volume both point to bears staying in control. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) dropped its key interest rate to 0%, and Chairman Martin Schlegel told Swiss broadcaster SRF on Saturday that monetary policy will continue to include forex actions if needed to control inflation. According to Reuters, the SNB will step in “to ensure price stability,” ignoring Washington’s recent move to add Switzerland to a watchlist for unfair currency practices. The US Treasury made that decision earlier this June, pushing Bern into a high-stakes position. If the US escalates the issue, Switzerland could face up to 31% in trade tariffs. Martin said that wouldn’t stop the bank from doing what it believes is necessary. “Switzerland and the SNB are not currency manipulators,” he said. “When we have intervened in the past, we have done it only to achieve our goal of price stability. Our motivation is not to gain an unfair advantage for Swiss exporters.” SNB cuts rates again while ignoring watchlist threat This latest rate cut, 25 basis points down to 0%, was widely expected by markets. Ahead of the decision, traders had priced in an 81% chance of it. Only 19% expected something larger. The SNB’s statement explained that “inflationary pressure has decreased compared to the previous quarter,” and the central bank “is countering the lower inflationary pressure” with its decision. Schlegel told CNBC’s Carolin Roth that while short-term drops in prices were visible, “current negative inflation for us is not a reason to lower interest rates.” What matters, he said, is the “medium term.” Even repeated negative monthly prints wouldn’t change the bank’s approach. The SNB lowered its inflation forecast for 2025. It now expects average inflation at 0.2% this year and 0.5% in 2026. The bank said the economic outlook remains uncertain and pointed to “developments abroad” as the biggest threat. It’s not the first time Switzerland has dealt with weak inflation. Similar conditions dominated the 2010s and early 2020s. Economist Charlotte de Montpellier from ING, who covers France and Switzerland , explained that the Swiss franc continues to gain strength during periods of global stress. She said this “systematically pushes down the price of imported products,” which hits the consumer price index. With Switzerland being a small economy that depends heavily on imports, CPI inflation takes a hit every time the franc strengthens. Franc’s rise fuels deflation as SNB supports new UBS capital rules To manage this, the SNB is keeping interest rates “systematically lower than elsewhere,” according to Charlotte. That approach is meant to slow the rise of the franc. Despite the cut, the Swiss currency stayed firm. After the Thursday decision, the US dollar last traded flat against it. The SNB’s aggressive monetary actions are paired with support for stricter rules on UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank. Martin backed new government proposals that could force UBS to hold an extra $26 billion in core capital. He said, “This is not a radical solution. Everyone has an interest in UBS doing well, that UBS is a strong bank, and that UBS is also a bank that is strongly capitalised and well prepared in terms of liquidity.” Martin also mentioned past discussions with US officials when Switzerland landed on the watchlist before. He said there was a “very good” understanding of why the country had been active in the forex space. If the country ends up staying on the list again, he said it would just lead to “further dialogue.” While other central banks are focused on fighting inflation, Switzerland is managing the opposite. Deflation is back, and the SNB is using every tool available — interest rates, market interventions, and bank capital rules — to keep control. And whether the Oval likes it or not, the SNB isn’t backing down.

Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law on June 21, 2025, creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and making Texas the third U.S. state to do so. Gov. Abbott received SB 21 on June 1, 2025, and had until June 22, 2025, to sign or veto it. Under the Texas Constitution, a bill left unsigned by that date becomes law automatically. With SB 21 now signed, Texas has now become the third state to approve a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after Arizona and New Hampshire. Source: Legiscan.com Under SB 21 , the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage a fund kept outside the state treasury. It will be funded by legislative appropriations, dedicated fees, investment returns, and voluntary cryptocurrency gifts. The law sets rules on how the comptroller can buy, hold, and sell digital assets. Supporters say it will help guard against inflation, boost the state’s financial strength, and keep Texas ahead in digital asset use. Texas Bitcoin Reserve focuses on stability with market cap threshold The law only lets the fund invest in cryptocurrencies that have had an average market cap of at least $500 billion in the past 12 months. That rule is meant to keep the fund focused on large, stable coins—currently, that is mainly Bitcoin. Since its first draft, SB 21 was revised in the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency. The most recent version adds clearer guidelines, new risk controls, and limits the comptroller’s power over speculative spending of public money. Earlier, Texas also approved House Bill 4488. That law prevents any funds set aside for a future Bitcoin reserve from being swept into the general revenue fund. It created the legal basis for holding digital assets under state law. While HB 4488 protects the reserve funds, SB 21 is the law that actually lets the state create the reserve. It allows the comptroller to use surplus general revenue to buy digital assets with a market value of at least $600 billion, a threshold met only by Bitcoin today.

With a noticeable uptick in developer activity and signs of quiet institutional accumulation, Solana is beginning to show the early signs of a potential rebound. But while Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, a different name is starting to dominate crypto watchlists, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at $0.03, MUTM is catching fire in crypto news today thanks to its razor-sharp DeFi focus. Already, more than $10.9 million has been raised in the presale, with 12,300 early investors participating so far. Already being hyped as the best crypto to buy in 2025, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the top token you might regret ignoring this summer. Mutuum Finance Presale Exceeds $10.9M, Attracts More Than 12,300 Investors Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most promising players in the DeFi ecosystem with its presale surging over $10.9 million and attracting more than 12,300 investors on board early. The buzz surrounding the project is gaining momentum, and this is a very good indication of the project’s future. In the current stage of Phase 5, MUTM tokens have reached the price of $0.03, but it won’t last long Stage 6 will put the price at $0.035. Demand is growing exponentially and the first-mover advantage in the decentralized lending space that Mutuum Finance has is even more precious as it stands to be one of the best early-stage DeFi investments of 2025. $100,000 MUTM Giveaway: 10 Participants to Win $10K Mutuum Finance is a new protocol eager to reward the first supporters it has on its platform and has opened a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be selected and offered $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This campaign will be an acknowledgment of the rapidly expanding community in the project as well as gratitude to the initial investors. However, the clock is ticking. Do not lose the opportunity to be one of the winners and at the same time gaining a stake as one of the most discussed new projects in DeFi. Built to Trust, Assisted by Transparency The majority of DeFi projects fail as they are not practicing what their preach promises, but Mutuum Finance is demonstrating strength by showing actual credibility and infrastructure. Platform smart contracts have undergone fully audited on CertiK which is a highly renowned name in the field of blockchain security. Such a third-party audit strengthens the foundation of Mutuum Finance on reliability to security and transparency in the long run. But Mutuum Finance is also building an Ethereum-based fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that will provide price stability, high liquidity, and smooth integration among DeFi applications. For retail and institutional use, this stablecoin will be the anchor of a stable, secure financial infrastructure far into the future.

Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is attracting the attention of traders, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts alike. Notably, market watchers are betting big, predicting bold projections of up to 23,800% return on investment. Bitcoin and Cardano Stuck in the Middle Bitcoin has seen volatility in June, fluctuating between $101,000 and $112,000. After a brief decline to $101,000 amid geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, BTC rebounded above $105,000. However, the broader outlook remains cautious. BTC 1-month price chart- source CoinGecko Analysts have put the limelight on the mounting global uncertainties, including Federal Reserve rate decisions and ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran. Notably, this has turned BTC into more of a hedge than a growth vehicle. Despite heightened acceptance in corporate institutions, like GameStop’s recent capital allocation to BTC, skepticism remains high. Notably, a drop below the $100K mark could quickly sour sentiment and trigger a wave of sell-offs among risk-averse investors. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, is navigating a different kind of turbulence. As of mid-June, ADA is trading between $0.61 and $0.78, but most recently fell over 6% to around $0.6412 after failing to break key resistance levels at $0.68. Internal governance debates and ongoing ecosystem upgrades are keeping the community engaged, but the upward price momentum has left many retail investors uncertain. While Cardano’s commitment to decentralization, interoperability, and DeFi remains strong, the token’s performance has not been motivating for short-term speculators looking for big gains. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is The Breakout Opportunity of 2025. With the top-tier tokens consolidating, eyes are now turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, an explosive new entry that’s quickly becoming known as the ultimate 2025 investor Pick. Notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a top analyst’s choice. Market pundits have made projections as high as 23,800% ROI, and the early metrics support this bullish case. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart due to its capped supply model, which introduces built-in scarcity. Additionally, the project has taken a prudent step forward which is highly attractive to long-term investors. Notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone a full audit by HashEx. The audit revealed no stealth minting features, and no security vulnerabilities, ensuring maximum transparency and investor protection. The excitement around MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by large-scale buyer, strong on-chain engagement, and a surging online community. Early investors are doubling down on the asset. Final Verdict Bitcoin and Cardano are currently facing hurdles. Both cryptocurrencies are struggling with macroeconomic headwinds, including persistent inflation, and rising interest rates. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently demonstrating impressive upward momentum.This surge is fueled by a wholesome combination of factors, including robust investor confidence and a compelling growth narrative.

The victim, a 56-year-old man and a father of a well-known crypto investor, was abducted from his home in Saint-Genis-Pouilly, close to the French-Swiss border. The case has caused people to worry about the safety of crypto executives and their families in Europe and around the world. French Police Identified Suspects After Months of Investigation The kidnapping happened on the night of December 31, 2024, when five masked people broke into the family’s home. Armed and aggressive, the attackers beat the man and his wife before placing a call to their intended target, the couple’s son, to demand a ransom. When the payment could not be secured, the attackers fled the scene with the father, leaving his wife tied up in the home. Days later, police found the man locked in the trunk of a car nearly 450 miles away. He had been assaulted and soaked in petrol. According to a local news outlet, police have arrested five people in connection with the crime. The suspects are four adults aged 18 to 22 and one 17-year-old. They all have long criminal histories, including theft and drug crimes. Police have not shared the crypto investor’s name. They only said he was well-known to the public for his success, making him and his family a target. A Growing Threat in the Crypto World This case is not an isolated event. France has seen a sharp rise in crimes targeting people in the crypto industry . According to Binance, France and the United States are currently the two countries with the highest number of crypto-related kidnappings. Across Southeast Asia and Latin America, similar cases are being reported. One high-profile incident involved a Russian crypto couple kidnapped in Argentina. The suspects in that case are still at large, and international efforts are ongoing to locate them. Crypto Investors Respond With Security Measures As these incidents become more frequent, crypto millionaires and executives are hiring bodyguards from private security firms and reducing their public exposure. The Paymium kidnapping case, another recent event in France, shows just how serious this problem is becoming. French police are still investigating the latest case and are warning crypto enthusiasts to be careful about their safety. As cryptocurrencies become more valuable and popular, they also draw dangerous attention. The arrests in France show progress, but the overall risk remains.

Chainlink (LINK): Powering Real-World Data for Smart Contracts Chainlink (LINK) remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now because of its core role as a leading oracle network in blockchain. It helps smart contracts access real-world data securely and accurately, allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to function beyond on-chain limits. This makes Chainlink a key part of the growing DeFi sector and keeps it ahead in its field. Currently priced around $15.42, LINK has shown consistent strength in the market. The project is widely adopted across multiple blockchains and continues forming new partnerships to improve its reach. Chainlink’s vital role in enabling smart contracts and its long-term utility make it a strong option. It continues to stand out among the best crypto coins to buy now for anyone looking to broaden their crypto exposure. 3. Avalanche (AVAX): Fast Network with Growing Adoption Avalanche (AVAX) is now a leading choice for running decentralized apps due to its fast and scalable blockchain. With the ability to process more than 4,500 transactions per second, it’s one of the most efficient platforms out there. Its consensus model helps the network remain secure while handling high-speed traffic, making it a useful option for future DeFi and Web3 services. At $21.12 per token, AVAX offers a chance to enter a growing ecosystem. The platform’s low transaction fees and fast performance continue to attract builders and new projects. With more apps launching on Avalanche, its usage is increasing. Those looking for speed and scale will find AVAX among the best crypto coins to buy now. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Making Blockchains Work Together Polkadot (DOT) stands out as one of the best crypto coins to buy now because of its approach to blockchain communication. It solves a big problem by letting different blockchains interact easily through a shared system. Its multichain setup gives developers the tools to create their own chains that work together in a single network, which is ideal for dApps and DeFi platforms. Trading at $4.12, Polkadot is well-positioned for growth as the need for connected blockchains increases. Its parachain model links various networks, helping developers build new tools with more flexibility. As blockchain use expands, Polkadot’s role in creating a connected ecosystem becomes more important. It’s a solid pick among the best crypto coins to buy now. Final Thoughts on These Crypto Picks Exploring the best crypto coins to buy now can help uncover future leaders in blockchain. From BlockDAG’s efficient design to Chainlink’s oracle support, Avalanche’s high-speed network, and Polkadot’s cross-chain focus, each project offers real strengths. These features set them apart in a competitive space. As crypto continues to grow, these coins are gaining attention for their strong tech and rising adoption. They’re not just building for today but helping shape the next phase of blockchain. For those planning ahead in crypto, these names deserve a close look.

Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies use substantial electricity to validate their ecosystems. In April 2024, the Norwegian government announced plans to restrict data centres to focus resources on more productive forms of work. Norway’s digitisation Minister, Karianne Tung, said the initiative aimed to control and limit undesirable projects such as crypto mining. Terje Aasland, Energy Minister for Norway, said that the main impetus for temporarily banning crypto mining data centres was meeting the nation’s climate targets. Aasland said crypto mining was incompatible with the government’s climate targets because the technology uses excess electricity and doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the nation’s long-term investments. Norway has a history of cracking down on crypto mining. In 2022, the government proposed ending tax incentives for the crypto mining industry, forcing the sector to pay the standard rate for electricity. Trygve Slagsvold, Finance Minister for Norway, said the move was about prioritising energy to benefit the whole community. Slagsvold pointed out that crypto does little to help the local community, yet uses tremendous energy. Norway has been an attractive destination for Bitcoin miners because it powers its grid with 92% of its energy from hydropower. Another 7% of energy is powered by wind sources, making the country an incredibly resourceful economy as far as climate targets are concerned. However, this is not enough for the Norwegian government because it is concerned about the long-term viability of crypto mining. Residents of Hadsel, a Norwegian province, petitioned the government in October 2024 to shut down a local Bitcoin mine. Yet, they suffered a rude shock when their electricity prices skyrocketed due to energy companies accounting for lost revenue. Venture capitalists quickly pointed out that residents suffered when the government targeted Bitcoin. However, the mayor of Hadsel, Kjell-Borge Freiberg, said that residents had been complaining about the noise emanating from the Bitcoin mining data centre. The Bitcoin mining operations produced 20% of the energy company’s revenue. When the Bitcoin mine was shut down, the energy company passed on its lost revenue to consumers. It is also possible that the energy company is punishing the residents for disrupting its bottom line. The energy company, however, may lament that one customer could disrupt their business model by shutting down operations. It is estimated that residents of Hadsel, due to the closure of the mine, will pay an extra $235 to $280 on their annual electricity bill. Russia implemented a mining ban on ten regions, including ones that already experienced a vulnerable energy grid. Many countries, such as Norway, are taking a critical stance towards crypto mining, at times for meeting climate targets, while at other times to restrict the spread of anonymous currencies. Energy-rich countries, such as Norway, are budgeting their energy use to prioritise their grid for what they believe are more productive industries. Miners must either remain in the country, invest in low-power consumables, or relocate to another country. There is also the option to switch completely to proof-of-stake methods to appease the Norwegian government and make a profit at the same time. In 2024, Norway first attempted to scrutinize the crypto mining industry by announcing a new set of regulations to shape the market in a way that they felt was appropriate, specifically to adhere to their climate change targets and beliefs about sustainability. The new regulations started this process by requiring all data centres engaged in crypto mining to register their activities. The Norwegian government, however, is adamant that the regulations were not intended to punish the crypto industry but were designed to better align the industry with national targets.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Norway,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-21 22:14:04

Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $2,391 Market Cap $305.82M Trading Volume (24h) $40.64B Circulating Supply 120.7M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $2,448.41 24-hour Low $2,382.26 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility 2.49% 50-day SMA $2,300.76 200-day SMA $2,420.46 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 62 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 14-day RSI 52.65 Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-day chart Based on the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) for June 21, current price action suggests a weakening bullish structure. ETH has broken below the middle line of the Bollinger Bands, indicating potential bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 40.60, near the oversold territory, and is trending downward, reflecting weakening buying pressure. Price has also fallen under the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), now acting as resistance around $2,560. Unless buyers reclaim this level, ETH may test lower Bollinger support near $2,346. Momentum is tilting bearish, and without a reversal above $2,560, short-term downside risk remains dominant on the daily timeframe. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Based on the 4-hour chart for Ethereum (ETH), the outlook currently skews bearish. The price has fallen below the lower Bollinger Band near $2,381, which could signal oversold conditions but also reflects intensified selling pressure. The MACD indicator is deeply negative, with the MACD line at -8.45 and a wide gap from the signal line, suggesting strong bearish momentum. Moreover, the Balance of Power indicator at -0.87 further confirms dominant selling activity. Unless ETH reclaims the midline around $2,483 and sustains a move above it, the near-term trend remains under pressure, with potential to revisit the $2,300–$2,350 support zone.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of bearish momentum, with prices retreating below significant support levels. On the 1-day chart, the RSI is declining and now hovering near the 40 level, indicating fading bullish strength and possible continuation of downward pressure. The Bollinger Bands show price action testing the lower band, suggesting volatility and weakness. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD is deeply negative with widening bearish histograms, confirming ongoing sell-side dominance. Unless ETH reclaims the $2,500 range with strong volume, the short-term trajectory remains cautious, with potential dips toward the $2,300 support region. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,458 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $38,085, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,333 and a high of $12,545 Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $26,554. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $56,126 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum At ETHGlobal, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the urgent need for privacy solutions, urging developers to focus on four critical areas: private money, identity, voting, and messaging. He framed privacy as a civilizational priority, encouraging the ecosystem to build tools that safeguard individual autonomy in an increasingly digital world. ""On a civilizational level, there's quite alot of urgency in us figuring out privacy."" @VitalikButerin urges builders at ETHGlobal to focus on 4 key categories of privacy apps to help solve for this: 1) private money 2) private identity 3) private voting 4) private messaging pic.twitter.com/1x49zNiVZm — ETHGlobal (@ETHGlobal) May 30, 2025 Ethereum announced that its much-anticipated network upgrade, Pectra, is coming to Mainnet on May 7th.

Vitalik Buterin’s RISC-V plan might make Ethereum’s technical infrastructure stronger, which could bring in more developers and make it easier to scale. But the sudden drop in base layer activity and gas costs that are lower than they’ve ever been raise doubts about how many people want to utilize the network and how long it will last. Ethereum might pick up speed again if it successfully executes protocol changes and Layer 2 solutions become more popular. Changes in the broader crypto market, new rules, and the adoption of crypto by businesses will also be very important. Ethereum’s price path in 2025 is still unclear and will be affected by both internal and external market factors, even if it has room to develop. Ethereum’s price outlook remains optimistic, with projections suggesting the potential for new all-time highs, possibly reaching near $6,000, driven by adoption, innovation, and network growth. However, external economic uncertainties or unfavorable conditions could press ETH prices toward an annual low of $4,825, with average estimates based on market sentiment hovering around $5,458.

This article explores how Ondo (ONDO) , Maker (MKR) , and others are poised for potential growth, reshaping the financial landscape. Ondo Price Snapshot Amid Altcoin Season and Global Bull Outlook ONDO recent performance reflects a sharp decline, with a one-week drop of 6.81% and a one-month fall of 23.82%. The half-year performance shows a significant decrease of about 54.05%. These numbers indicate a consistent downward movement in recent periods. The price behavior portrays a market that has struggled to recover, with traders witnessing a steady deterioration and clear corrections over time. The shifts in price have been considerable, signaling a need for cautious observation as market dynamics continue to evolve. Current price levels range from $0.70 to $1.05, with resistance at $1.27 and support at $0.57. A secondary barrier exists at $1.62, while another support level is noted at $0.21. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator near -0.100 and -0.123 suggest active selling, reinforcing a bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index at 37.25 hints at potential oversold conditions but does not confirm a strong rally. Trading ideas may focus on short-term pauses at $0.57 or potential reversal signs if the price breaches $1.27. With bears dominating and volatility high, any move above key resistance could signal a cautious entry for bulls aiming to restructure the current downtrend. Maker Market Outlook: Steady Half-Year Growth Amid Key Price Levels Maker saw a 6.54% gain over the past month and a notable 17.23% climb in the last six months. A recent drop of 14.15% highlights short-term volatility, yet the longer-term trend remains positive. The coin traded consistently between $1340 and $1880, demonstrating gradual strength over time. Price action reflects moments of pressure followed by recovery, suggesting a market capable of bouncing back after downturns while slowly building upward momentum. Currently, Maker is trading with significant barriers in view. There is clear support around $1111.33 and resistance at approximately $2191.33. The price is fluctuating within these defined bounds. Buyers are active near the support threshold, while sellers resist near the resistance level, indicating a balance between bulls and bears. Trading within these parameters appears promising. Pullbacks near support may offer entry points, while approaching resistance could signal taking profits. Additional levels, such as a second resistance near $2731.33 and second support near $571.33, add further caution. Moving indicators suggest a careful approach, requiring tactical entries based on real-time price behavior. IOTA Faces Significant Drops and Key Technical Levels IOTA lost nearly 29% of its value over the past month and almost 45% over the last six months. Its recent performance includes a weekly drop of about 6.51%, emphasizing persistent bearish pressure. The price action during these periods indicates an overall decline, with selling pressure consistently exceeding buying interest. Investors have shown increased caution as market momentum has slowed. Historical data suggests diminished investor sentiment and a trend primarily characterized by declines, making it a challenging environment for any bullish opportunities. IOTA is currently trading in a range between $0.14 and $0.24, with a resistance zone at $0.31 and another barrier near $0.41. The nearest support level is around $0.10, with a secondary support at $0.00046. Technical indicators reveal a continued bearish dominance, as shown by an Awesome Oscillator value of -0.026, a momentum indicator at -0.028, and an RSI of 34.89. The lack of a clear trend means the coin is likely to remain within these boundaries. Trading strategies should focus on cautiously building positions near support at $0.10 and considering profit-taking near resistance at $0.31. Conclusion Ondo (ONDO) , Maker (MKR) , and IOTA offer distinct solutions in the expanding field of real-world asset platforms. Each has its own strengths, showcasing innovation and practical applications. Ondo focuses on secure and profitable financial services. Maker leads in stability and decentralized finance. IOTA brings new efficiency in transactions. Together, they illustrate the versatile potential of blockchain technology in real-world contexts.

But prominent attorney Bill Morgan has publicly cast doubt on these rumors. Is The US Planning To Seize Ripple’s Escrowed XRP? According to widely followed crypto analyst John Squire, the United States government could potentially take control of the XRP tokens currently held in Ripple’s escrow. This revelation comes at a significant time, following President Donald Trump’s previous confirmation of plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile holding cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple’s XRP. However, Bill Morgan refuted claims that the US government intends to utilize XRP as part of a broader strategy to support its financial system. “No it won’t,” Morgan asserted in a post on X. Another industry commentator, going by the online alias Pumpius , also informed his X followers about the rumors about the US authorities potentially repurposing Ripple’s XRP escrow as part of the national financial reserves. Pumpius compared the XRP scenario to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were once considered unlikely but ultimately became a reality, indicating that the Ripple-affiliated crypto could make its way to US reserves. Notably, the longstanding Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, spurring optimism within the community. Regulatory clarity on XRP’s legal status is stirring speculation about its potential inclusion. A host of companies have in recent months announced reserves of the Ripple-created cryptocurrency. Singapore-based Web3 company Trident Digital announced it will start a strategic XRP treasury of up to $500 million. Others like Webus, VivoPower, and Wellgistics have also announced XRP-centric reserves. These moves are indicative of growing institutional interest in Ripple’s XRP ecosystem. While Ripple’s technology is gaining traction among corporations, claims related to US reserves remain unsubstantiated.

They’re moving capital now into high-potential presales with real utility, strong fundamentals, and explosive upside. Several projects have emerged as strategic picks, but one name is standing out across every analyst report and trading desk. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining momentum as the most anticipated altcoin of the year. Backed by strong fundamentals, a fully audited framework, and a live ecosystem, this project is now being tracked as a breakout leader in 2025. Early movers are already locking in positions before prices lift off. Here are the top presales to watch before the next parabolic rally begins. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE has the Upper Hand in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the most watched altcoins of 2025. With a bold vision, aggressive rollout, and unmatched market presence, this project is capturing early attention from crypto insiders and strategic investors looking for serious upside. Analysts tracking top altcoins refer to it as a breakout contender, citing its fixed supply, governance model, and fully organic ownership as key differentiators. The fundamentals are already functioning while the broader market is still waking up. Investor demand is also climbing fast. With each presale milestone filled in record time, MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as a strategic opportunity for long-term crypto holders and institutional buyers alike. Its momentum is organic, its structure lean, and its entry point remains one of the most asymmetric opportunities available in today’s market. Qubetics: Powering Interoperability Across Chains Qubetics is another standout contender gaining massive traction. Its ecosystem is built for next-generation blockchain applications, combining real-world asset tokenization with no-code development tools. With advanced cross-chain capabilities, support for multichain wallets, and seamless Apple Pay integration, Qubetics is proving it can drive mass adoption beyond crypto-native users. Analysts are forecasting a breakout, especially as its mainnet rollout completes and key features like decentralized VPN and fractional ownership marketplaces go live. Institutional-grade infrastructure and simplified onboarding are giving it long-term relevance. No wonder large investors are already rotating into Qubetics with aggressive positioning ahead of its post-launch trading. With a full mainnet launch slated for Q2 2025 and a streamlined bridge system in place, analysts expect significant ROI for those who got in early. Insider sentiment remains strong, with projections reaching over 5,000% in potential gains. BlockDAG: Utility Meets Momentum BlockDAG continues to post powerful numbers, attracting attention for its real-time staking access, airdrop incentives, and massive presale traction. Unlike speculative tokens, BlockDAG emphasizes live blockchain usage through its X1 Miner App, enabling users to earn and engage daily.

Lightchain AI: The AI-Blockchain Fusion Lightchain AI is rewriting the script for what blockchain can do with artificial intelligence. Its Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) model rewards real computational work instead of idle staking. That means every token earned comes from real utility, not idle inflation. The upcoming mainnet will activate a purpose-built AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), designed to run parallelized tasks at scale. Analysts are watching closely. Early signals show Lightchain AI attracting long-term investors looking for ROI potential. From staking rewards to a transparent DAO structure, Lightchain AI is capturing aggressive capital—and insiders are forecasting it as one of the top “risk-on” plays of the cycle. Ruvi AI: Real-World Utility at Scale Ruvi AI is earning a reputation as one of the most utility-focused AI tokens on the market. Operating across marketing, entertainment, and finance sectors, it merges artificial intelligence with blockchain for scalable, real-world applications. Its smart contract audit and liquidity partner support position it well for long-term sustainability. Projections for this token range up to $1, with analysts forecasting a good potential ROI by the end of 2025 — a serious move for those betting early on next-gen AI platforms. Final Word The 2025 bull market is shaping up to be one of the most transformative cycles in crypto history. Projects with strong fundamentals, early adoption, and real-world traction are already gaining serious momentum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE in front.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has restricted electronic vehicle manufacturers’ access to a material essential to their technology: cobalt. Today’s development is the latest in a familiar theme of trade wars spreading across different sectors. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the world’s leading producer of cobalt, and as such, the move spells uncertainty for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. Congo’s cobalt export ban remains in place Congo’s mineral regulatory agency made the announcement on Saturday. The industry is currently experiencing a crisis as global cobalt prices remain in decline. Miners are currently divided over how to navigate the growing stockpile. The original four-month export suspension was imposed in February 2025 to curb an oversupply of cobalt, a critical component in lithium-ion batteries used in EVs, smartphones, and other high-tech devices. The initial ban was set to expire on June 23, but the new extension will run until September, keeping roughly 70% of the world’s cobalt production largely unavailable to global markets. “The decision has been taken to extend the temporary suspension due to the continued high level of stock on the market,” the Authority for the Regulation and Control of Strategic Mineral Substances’ Markets (ARECOMS) said in a statement. #RDC_MINES | COMMUNIQUÉ Prolongation de la suspension temporaire de l’exportation du Cobalt. pic.twitter.com/S8XyZPLKDL — Ministère des Mines – RDC (@MinMinesRDC) June 21, 2025 Congo’s ARECOMS expects its market intervention to stabilize cobalt prices, which fell to a nine-year low of $10 per pound earlier this year. Cobalt miners are divided on cobalt control strategy Congo’s latest move has sparked disagreement among the industry’s biggest players, including Glencore and CMOC Group. These companies are the world’s top two cobalt producers, and they are currently on opposite sides in terms of how to move forward. Congolese authorities have been considering implementing a system of export quotas that would limit how much cobalt each mining company can ship abroad once the ban is eventually lifted. The proposal is still under review, but it appears to have gained traction with Glencore, an Anglo-Swiss mining and commodities giant. The company believes a quota-based system is a way to better manage supply and pricing. However, CMOC Group, China’s state-backed mining conglomerate, is lobbying for the immediate removal of the export ban altogether. CMOC argues that the continued suspension will distort global markets, undermine long-term supply relationships, and could damage the reputation of Congolese cobalt as a reliable input for EV manufacturers and tech firms. This is especially important as major automakers are currently ramping up EV production in an effort to meet their ambitious climate targets. These companies require stable and ethical sources of battery materials. Disruptions in cobalt supply can lead to delays in battery manufacturing, increase costs, and force companies to seek alternative methods that rely less heavily on cobalt. Already, several battery producers have begun transitioning toward nickel-rich or cobalt-free technologies. This change is partly due to ethical concerns tied to artisanal mining in the DRC, and now because of price volatility and regulatory unpredictability. The extended Congolese export ban is expected to tighten global cobalt availability further, potentially driving prices upward in the second half of the year if stockpiles begin to shrink. Some analysts believe the DRC’s move may encourage speculative hoarding or opportunistic deals with buyers willing to pay a premium for early access once exports resume. For now, ARECOMS has said it will issue a final decision to either modify, lift, or further extend the suspension before the new three-month period ends in September. “We will continue monitoring stock levels and market conditions and will provide further guidance before the current extension expires,” an agency spokesperson said.

XRP is pushing forward amid regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing resilience with deep ecosystem development and high-stakes whale activity. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the playbook on community-driven tokens with a rapidly growing presence and fixed-supply economics. XRP Legal Saga and a Fractal-Led Forecast to $15 XRP has once again had some progress in the ongoing legal saga with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The recent joint motion to dissolve the court’s longstanding injunction and the finalized $50 million settlement is an important point. SEC had dropped its lawsuit earlier this year, and Judge Torres’ decision on the final settlement motion is an outcome that could affect XRP-spot ETF approvals. Technical analysts are turning increasingly bullish. Forecasts range from targets of $5 to $15, with historical fractals from XRP’s 2017 breakout playing a central role in current models. Bitget and Standard Chartered continue to point to mid- and long-term upside, suggesting room for significant growth. At the same time, institutional adoption is quietly gaining pace. BitGo’s $100 million XRP position for VivoPower underscores the token’s appeal as a treasury asset. Meanwhile, upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) are making cross-border payments and DeFi applications more accessible than ever. Shiba Inu Ecosystem Upgrades Amid Whale-Fueled Accumulation Despite a recent price decline in line with broader market weakness, Shiba Inu remains a project worth watching. The token is showing increased accumulation from large holders, with over 15 trillion SHIB moving into whale wallets in just one day—the largest spike in six months. The SHIB ecosystem is quietly evolving in ways that could reshape its market perception. The Shibarium Layer-2 solution is advancing in adoption, designed to lower gas costs and boost speed for transactions. Meanwhile, the rollout of ShibDAO and the new Shib Alpha Layer signals an ambitious roadmap focused on governance, staking, and privacy-enhanced scalability. The derivatives market paints a mixed picture, with long liquidations suggesting caution. However, on-chain activity tells a different story: increased whale participation, a stable support level around $0.00001100, and long-term holders continuing to engage with the network. Why Investors Don’t Want to Miss Out on MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE project is turning heads across both retail and institutional segments. Analysts now consistently list it for its disruptive potential. The appeal is multi-layered: a fixed supply that encourages scarcity-based accumulation and a strong cultural identity that has catalyzed viral momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built tangible utility into its ecosystem. On the other hand, HashEx-audited smart contracts and 100% community ownership establish credibility and transparency. With mounting speculation around major exchange listings and visible wallet activity indicating high retention and repeat buyers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a standout performer heading into Q3. Its presale—described by analysts as a “strategic accumulation phase”—is an opportunity to enter early before the project broadens into public markets. MAGACOIN’s fundamentals and structure are increasingly difficult to ignore. Final Thoughts The crypto market is volatile and narratives evolve overnight, but the key is to know what to expect. XRP, SHIB, and MAGACOIN FINANCE each represent unique altcoin cases. As Q3 2025 approaches, these are not coins to watch casually—they’re the ones smart investors are already moving on. It could be XRP for its potential for explosive upside post-regulatory resolution or SHIB, which is quite resilient, backed by real infrastructure. MAGACOIN has established itself as part of the next leg of the crypto cycle.

Notably, the altcoin has been a major headliner amidst a general crypto market correction in the past one month. During this period, XRP prices have dipped by over 10% with current market prices around $2.13. While crypto enthusiasts remain hopeful of market resurgence, Coin Bureau’s recent revelations shows that on-chain data suggests otherwise. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy XRP $3 Target Impossible Amid Declining Network Activity – Analyst According to an X post by Coin Bureau on June 20, XRP is facing an uphill task in regaining its bullish form due to network engagement crises. Notably, data from Glassnode shows that new wallets on the XRP Ledger have crashed from above 30,000 new addresses daily in January to presently below 5,000 new addresses daily. Interestingly, the chart by Glassnode presents a strong correlation between price action and network growth. The surge in wallet creation during late Q4 2024 was accompanied by a parabolic move in price that brought XRP to trade as high as $2.71. However, as the rate of new users entering the network began to decline, XRP’s price action also entered a consolidation and gradual downward trend. Amidst other developments, Coin Bureau also highlights XRP’s daily active addresses has experienced a staggering drop from 557,000 to 34,000 to further suggest a lack of retail investor interest in the XRP ecosystem. According to the market analyst, the glaring fall in network engagement indicates XRP may lack sufficient market demand to support a bullish climb towards the $3 price region which is a crucial resistance zone. However, other analysts have presented an alternative theory. In particular, a market expert with X pseudonym MoonLambo explains the previous highs in network activity seen in Q4 2024 and January coincided with a period of widespread market greed following the US general elections. The analyst claims the decline is normal alongside social trends rather and is overemphasized by Coin Bureau.

Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 22.29% and valued at $2.25 billion. According to data from prediction site CoinCodex, XRP Investors still remain largely bearish but the Fear & Greed Index stands neutral at 54. CoinCodex analysts are predicting XRP to remain in consolidation for the short term with predictions of $2.12 in one month. However, they forecast a steady long-term bullish revival with projections of $2.45 in three months and $3.03 in six months.

But a few names are beginning to stand out, fast. BlockDAG, Stellar (XLM), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Solana (SOL) are emerging as some of the fastest-growing cryptos, each with a different strength pulling them forward. BlockDAG is rewriting how blockchain scales. Stellar is inching deeper into institutional finance. Shiba Inu continues to prove it’s more than a meme. And Solana, once doubted, now leads the Layer 1 conversation. Here’s a breakdown of where each one is heading, and why they deserve attention in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Disrupting Blockchain Performance With Parallel Power BlockDAG isn’t trying to follow the old rules, it’s rewriting them. While other chains move block by block, BlockDAG lets validators process multiple blocks at once, unlocking massive gains in scalability. Its parallel processing model pushes decentralisation forward while tackling delays and inefficiencies. It’s already making bold claims, and backing them. This is the fastest Proof-of-Work model running right now, confirming 10 blocks per second with goals to hit over 100 in the near future. But it’s not just about speed. BlockDAG is pushing hard on adoption too, with tools like its no-code dApp builder, token creator, and mobile mining app X1, now with more than 2 million users on board. Add to that $315 million raised in presale, over 23 billion BDAG coins sold, and a 2,660% increase from $0.001 to $0.0276 across 29 batches. For a limited time, buyers can still get in at $0.0020. With a mainnet launch around the corner, and hints at major U.S. sponsorships, BlockDAG is more than promising, it’s one of the fastest-growing cryptos making real moves. 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community Power Meets Ecosystem Growth Dismissed early as just another meme coin, Shiba Inu has steadily turned the tide. Currently priced at $0.00001172, it might not look like much on the surface, but its burn rate is accelerating fast, removing millions of tokens from circulation and reducing supply. Shibarium, its layer-2 solution, is expanding steadily, bringing new wallet activity and ecosystem tools. What’s making SHIB stand out in 2025 isn’t hype, it’s the work being done underneath. The community is highly engaged, and its utility is growing. In a market driven by loyalty and volume, SHIB continues to evolve, securing its spot among the fastest-growing cryptos this year. 3. Stellar (XLM): Quietly Building a Bridge to Big Finance Stellar isn’t making headlines every day, but it probably should be. Trading at $0.25, XLM has had its share of volatility, but the moves behind the scenes are what matter most. Its recent addition to the Nasdaq Crypto Index and ties with institutions like Franklin Templeton signal a serious shift in perception. It’s not just a payment network anymore, it’s a bridge between decentralised finance and the old world of traditional finance. With continued upgrades to improve performance and security, Stellar is shaping itself into an enterprise-ready blockchain. If you’re tracking quiet contenders with long-term reach, Stellar belongs on the list of fastest-growing cryptos to consider. 4. Solana (SOL): Powering Web3 at Lightning Speed Solana has taken its fair share of hits, but it continues to rise. Trading between $144 and $154, SOL now supports more than 11.6 million wallets. Its ecosystem is thriving, DeFi, NFTs, games, and payments are all being built and scaled on Solana faster than on most networks. Yes, resistance at key price levels has slowed momentum, but upcoming launches like the Solaxy ICO could reignite the rally. Solana’s low fees and high throughput keep developers locked in and activity high. With network speed and developer commitment on its side, Solana is still one of the fastest-growing cryptos as we move closer to 2025. 4 Contenders, One Market on the Move Heading into 2025, the crypto market isn’t short on bold ideas, but only a few are showing real execution. BlockDAG’s technology, combined with strong funding and public adoption, places it at the front. Stellar’s quiet integration into traditional finance gives it staying power. Shiba Inu proves what a motivated community can build, and Solana continues to lead where speed and scalability matter. Each of these fastest-growing cryptos is carving its own path. Whether you want infrastructure, innovation, community, or performance, these four bring it all to the table. The next bull run might not wait, so neither should your research.

This zone, referred to as the “white circle” in his analysis, has previously coincided with periods of strong upward momentum for XRP. According to EGRAG , XRP’s recent pullback to the $1.61 level in April 2025 marks its latest return to this critical area. The analyst argues that this development mirrors patterns seen during earlier market cycles, where a revisit to this zone preceded major price rallies. Based on this historical behavior, he has outlined three potential price targets for the next upward movement. Historical Analysis of XRP’s White Circle Pattern In EGRAG’s evaluation, the white circle represents a support region that XRP historically revisits after initial bullish breakouts above the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA). #XRP In The White Circle , We Always Pump! Based on my analysis, here are the potential targets: $11.50 $27 (with a massive 1227.5% pump) $42 Now, you might wonder: How did I arrive at these figures? Why is the minimum target $11.50, and why could we… pic.twitter.com/rnQebqMwED — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 20, 2025 This pattern was first observed in the 2017–2018 cycle. During that period, XRP surpassed the 21 EMA in March 2017 following nearly a year of sideways movement. From there, the asset rapidly climbed over 7,000% to reach $0.3988 by May 2017. Following this surge, XRP entered a consolidation phase that lasted approximately six months, ultimately returning to the 21 EMA. This marked the first instance of a white circle retest. The second leg of the rally then began, driving the token upward by an additional 1,900% to a peak of $3.55 in January 2018. A similar pattern emerged during the 2020–2021 market cycle. After years of trading below the 21 EMA due to broader market weakness and regulatory pressure, XRP broke above the moving average in late 2020, reaching $0.8294 by November. The rally was cut short, however, by the U.S. SEC lawsuit filed in December 2020. Nevertheless, XRP revisited the white circle support level and launched a secondary rally, rising nearly 500% to $1.98 by April 2021. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Context and Price Targets EGRAG believes XRP is currently repeating this pattern. The asset broke above the 21 EMA in November 2024 and reached a high of $3.40 by January 2025, representing a 580% gain. It has since entered a period of downward pressure, resulting in a retest of the 21 EMA in April at around $1.61. This price action, according to EGRAG, confirms another white circle revisit. Based on this technical behavior, he proposes three price targets. If XRP mimics the 2020–2021 pattern, a 465% gain from the 21 EMA could send the asset to $11.50. Should it follow the more aggressive 2017–2018 trajectory, it could rise by 1,964% to a peak of $42 . A middle-ground scenario, derived from the average of both previous cycles, yields a projected increase of 1,225%, placing XRP at $27, a level EGRAG has consistently emphasized in past analyses. While these projections are grounded in historical chart patterns and technical signals and are not mere speculation, investors must approach such forecasts with caution and consider market volatility and external factors when evaluating potential outcomes.

Why This Could Be the Best Entry Point of the Year,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/are-solana-sol-and-avalanche-avax-oversold-why-this-could-be-the-best-entry-point-of-the-year,"Recent market trends show significant price drops for both Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) . With values hitting lows, questions arise about whether this downturn signals a prime buying opportunity. Could these coins be on the verge of a significant rebound? Discover the factors that point to potential growth and why now might be the ideal time to invest. Solana Market Snapshot: Trends, Key Levels, and Trading Ideas Solana fell sharply over the past month, with prices dropping nearly 19% and a six-month decline of around 22%. The coin has struggled to maintain gains, reflecting a consistent downward movement over time. Price shifts have followed a pattern of quick corrections, and short-term dips have contributed to a broader bearish outlook. Declines over a single week of about 5% have added to the overall pressure, signaling that the market has been cautious in its movements. Volatility and a series of losses mark the recent performance, suggesting that sellers have been in control during these periods. The current price range sits between $136 and $182.20, with traders eyeing a key support level near $115.84 and the first resistance at $207.90. A second line of defense appears with support at $69.81, while a higher resistance is found around $253.93. The indicators show negative momentum, with both the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator below zero, confirming a bearish influence. The relative strength index at 38.07 indicates that the coin remains cautious, lacking a strong upward trend. Trading within these levels may involve seeking buying opportunities near support, along with careful stop-loss orders. Avalanche Trends: Bearish Past and Critical Price Levels Avalanche dropped 24% over the past month and slid 51.76% during the last six months. A week-long loss of 9.20% marks a clear downward movement in its price behavior. The coin has struggled to maintain recent levels, reflecting mounting bearish pressure and investor caution. The steady decline over these periods highlights the challenges the altcoin has faced, marked by a series of retracements that have left traders wary of further falls. The current price sits between $17.67 and $25.40, with strong support at $14.52 and resistance near $29.98. A secondary support at $6.79 and resistance at $37.70 add extra caution for market participants. A negative Awesome Oscillator of -2.90 and a Momentum reading of -3.95 suggest that bears dominate the market. An RSI of 34.66 indicates the coin could be nearing an oversold condition. Traders should watch for a potential bounce if the price touches the lower support and consider tight stop-loss strategies in this uncertain environment. Conclusion Both SOL and AVAX show signs of being oversold. This dip could provide a strong entry point for investors. The current prices may not last long. With potential for growth, entering now could yield high rewards. Timing is key in capturing future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

46506721,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=168845,1750548624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/46506721.jpeg,Can Solana and Bitcoin Match the Growth Outlook of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 100x Projections?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-solana-and-bitcoin-match-the-growth-outlook-of-magacoin-finances-100x-projections/,"While Bitcoin and Solana continue to hold commanding positions in the digital asset landscape, a rising force is drawing sharper focus from strategic investors and analysts alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With its early momentum accelerating and buyer interest increasing daily, the question now is whether legacy giants like BTC and SOL can keep pace with the explosive growth forecasted for this high-potential altcoin. Bitcoin trades firmly above $105,000, bolstered by inflows into its spot ETFs and increasing alignment with institutional portfolios. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem is evolving rapidly, preparing for a groundbreaking Alpenglow upgrade that could push transaction finality into sub-second territory. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding its narrative — not by replacing Bitcoin or Solana, but by carving out a distinct lane of ROI-focused opportunity that’s becoming difficult to ignore. Demand Is Shifting as Strategic Investors Seek Asymmetric Upside The high-cap status of Bitcoin and Solana means their growth potential is now largely tied to macro trends, ETF flows, and network upgrades. Bitcoin’s recent policy boost — with the U.S. government establishing a strategic crypto reserve funded by seized assets — signals strong top-down support. Likewise, Solana’s institutional traction is reflected in its $250M USDC minting and over $7.9M in daily network revenue. But that level of stability comes with a trade-off: reduced explosive upside. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With thousands already gaining early access, crypto insiders say it’s becoming one of the most actively watched projects of the year. Analysts tracking wallet behavior report surging participation in private access rounds, suggesting high conviction among early buyers. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outrun the Top Layer-1s Solana’s ecosystem continues to grow. Its upcoming Alpenglow upgrade — replacing Proof-of-History with Rotor and Votor layers — is expected to slash finality times from 12 seconds to 150 milliseconds. This positions SOL as a powerful platform for gaming, trading, and on-chain finance. In parallel, Ethereum-native developers are entering the Solana ecosystem through Solidity tooling enhancements, creating further developer momentum. Bitcoin, for its part, remains a macro asset favorite. The passage of the GENIUS Act and the executive order for a strategic crypto reserve — including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP — further elevates its institutional status. ETF inflows exceed $36 billion, outperforming even gold since launch. Still, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may outperform every token this cycle due to its current positioning. With no venture capital dilution, a capped supply, and fully audited smart contracts, the foundation is being laid for what some traders describe as a “top-tier asymmetric opportunity.” High-Volume Buyers Signal What’s Coming As Solana processes tens of millions in staking activity and stablecoin volume, and Bitcoin garners support from firms like Metaplanet and Strategy, the volume metrics for MAGACOIN FINANCE tell a different story — one of breakout positioning. Crypto trackers have flagged recurring early buys and aggressive tiered entry in recent rounds, indicating confidence that extends beyond retail speculation. The structure of its entry model — including time-sensitive access mechanics — has created urgency among investors aiming to get positioned before major listings. Some early-stage analysts have pointed to similar early accumulation patterns observed in previous cycles, just before top-performing altcoins exploded. Whether that trajectory repeats remains to be seen, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has certainly established itself as a project with a sharp growth vector. Is This the Altcoin That Breaks Out in 2025? Bitcoin and Solana offer massive scale and global name recognition. Bitcoin is being labeled “digital gold” again, as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty steer investors toward hard assets. Solana, with its fast-growing DeFi ecosystem and $13 billion in stablecoin value, continues to attract developers, projects, and institutional transactions at an impressive rate. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is not aiming to compete with scale — it’s targeting velocity. Momentum. Early access ROI. With every forecast, every chart, and every tracked buyer position, the evidence points in one direction: up. Strategic buyers aren’t waiting for a green light — they’re already in. As analysts run models for the second half of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being placed in an elite category of potential altcoin outperformers. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana remain pillars of strength in the ever-evolving crypto market. BTC’s alignment with macro policy and ETF success has solidified its reputation as a hedge asset, while Solana continues to set technical benchmarks with its high-speed performance and institutional utility. Yet, the landscape of opportunity is changing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a category-defining asset, not because it mimics the giants, but because it follows a different playbook. With strong early participation, analyst endorsements, and high-volume buy-ins accelerating, it’s no longer just an altcoin to watch — it’s one to act on. For investors seeking sharp upside, well-structured tokenomics, and early positioning before public listing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding attention. The movement has started — and it’s unfolding in real time.

46506613,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72158,1750548640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SHIB Price Forecasts from $0.01 to $1: Here are Likely Timelines,https://timestabloid.com/shib-price-forecasts-from-0-01-to-1-here-are-likely-timelines/,"Shiba Inu continues to attract interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and market analysts, despite its current underperformance. Some remain optimistic about the token’s long-term prospects, envisioning potential price milestones as high as $0.01 or even $1. While these forecasts are ambitious, proponents cite past market behavior and future project developments as reasons to remain hopeful. Current Market Standing The token is currently trading at $0.00001105, showing a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours and an 8.17% decline in the last week. Over the last 30 days, the token has lost 27.98% of its value. According to CoinMarketCap , SHIB holds the 19th position among cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of approximately $6.7 billion. Despite recent losses, long-term supporters believe SHIB could still achieve substantial gains, referencing its explosive growth during the 2020–2021 bull run when it surged by over 150,000,000%. Among the SHIB community, the possibility of the token reaching $0.01 is often referred to as the “one-cent dream.” Achieving this would require an increase of over 87,000% from its current price. However, such a price would give SHIB a market valuation of nearly $5.89 trillion, an amount that far exceeds the current total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. Luis Delgado, a market observer, has expressed optimism about this possibility. He believes that upcoming initiatives from Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, could potentially drive significant upward momentum. Delgado has stated that SHIB was conceptually designed to reach around the $0.01 level and maintains that long-term market dynamics could support this goal. Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, known as Lucie, has also echoed this sentiment. While she acknowledged that achieving $0.01 would require time, she emphasized that it remains a realistic target given sufficient development and market support. Possibility of Reaching $1 A $1 price point for SHIB is considered even more improbable by most analysts, as it would require a surge of nearly 8.8 million percent. At this valuation, SHIB’s market cap would exceed $589 trillion, significantly surpassing the value of global financial assets and even the total money supply, which was estimated at $129 trillion in Q2 2024. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Still, the $1 forecast is occasionally discussed within the community. CoinW , a cryptocurrency exchange, included SHIB’s potential rise to $1 in a recent public poll alongside other bullish predictions for major cryptocurrencies. Lucie also referenced ChatGPT’s view that a $1 price, while extremely challenging, is not entirely impossible if several favorable conditions align, including widespread adoption, extensive token burns, and a strong bull market. However, many analysts disagree. TradeCityPro , a contributor on TradingView, considers the $1 goal unrealistic due to the market cap implications. Similarly, Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie noted that SHIB will not reach such extreme valuations unless a large portion of its supply, currently at 589.25 trillion tokens, is removed from circulation. Forecast Timelines Neither Delgado nor Lucie has provided specific timelines for when SHIB might reach $0.01 or $1. To address this gap, predictions from platforms such as Changelly and Telegaon offer some guidance. According to Changelly, SHIB could reach the $0.01 mark by September 2040. Telegaon shares a similar estimate, projecting that SHIB may hit $0.08 by the end of 2040 and could even surpass $1 by 2050, reaching up to $1.06 under highly favorable circumstances. While there is a strong base of support for optimistic price targets, reaching $0.01 or $1 would require unprecedented market movements or a dramatic reduction in Shiba Inu’s circulating supply. As it stands, these milestones remain speculative and should be viewed with caution. The feasibility of such growth hinges on fundamental changes in tokenomics, adoption rates, and broader market dynamics.

Read This Report First,https://cryptopotato.com/think-crypto-is-used-for-illegal-activities-read-this-report-first/,"Cryptocurrency crime may be evolving, but the share of illicit such transactions remains strikingly small. According to TRM Labs’ latest annual report on crypto crime, just 0.4% of all digital asset transaction volume in 2024 was linked to unlawful activity, marking a 51% drop from the previous year despite a surge in the overall market. Illicit Crypto Activity Plummets Even as Total Volume Soars According to the blockchain intelligence firm, the total transaction volume in the crypto sector increased by 56% last year, surpassing $10.6 trillion. However, estimated illegal flows fell sharply to around $45 billion, down from nearly $59 billion in 2023. The report indicated that crypto crime was mainly dominated by sanction evaders, scammers, and funds linked to blocklisted addresses. Collectively, these categories represented over 85% of the illicit volume identified by TRM. Additionally, networks like Tron, Ethereum, and Bitcoin remained the top venues for such activity. Interestingly, while Tron alone accounted for 58% of all criminal flows, its illicit transaction volume actually fell by half compared to 2023. TRM attributed some of this success to the effectiveness of the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a pioneering public-private initiative targeting USDT misuse on Tron. Since its launch, it has helped freeze over $130 million , and nearly 20% of blocklisted USDT on Tron has already been returned to victims or authorities. Meanwhile, targeted sanctions against major Russian and Iranian exchanges such as Garantex and Nobitex, recently the target of a $49 million hack , have throttled inflows to restricted jurisdictions by 33%. Persistent Threats and the Evolving Criminal Playbook Despite the overall decline, TRM raised the alarm on emerging trends demanding vigilance. It stated that terrorism financing, particularly involving groups like ISIS-Khorasan (ISKP), is increasingly relying on crypto, with stablecoins remaining the primary choice despite a growing interest in privacy coins like Monero (XMR). Hacks also witnessed an uptick, with $2.2 billion stolen, representing a 17% increase, primarily targeting DeFi protocols. As has been reported by other researchers, North Korean actors were disproportionately responsible, stealing nearly $800 million using sophisticated methods, often focusing on private key theft. In addition, their laundering tactics have adapted, utilizing decentralized bridges and moving funds rapidly across chains to make recovery exceptionally difficult for law enforcement. But perhaps the most worrisome emerging threat is the rapid adoption of AI by fraudsters. According to TRM, criminals are now using large language models (LLMs) to craft highly personalized scam personas, generate convincing deepfake videos for extortion and investment scams, and produce sophisticated phishing messages. They are also using AI to create fake IDs to bypass KYC, and even generate non-consensual explicit imagery. The blockchain research firm is expecting a significant expansion of AI-powered crime in 2025. The post Think Crypto is Used for Illegal Activities?

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP’s price might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.67 Market Cap $2.49B Trading Volume $56.18M Circulating Supply 534.77M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.01 24-h Low $4.63 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.21% 14-Day RSI 41.68 50-Day SMA $5.36 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $6.51 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is trending downward, now down 5.30%. Short-term indicators solidify bearish momentum. The next key support is at $4.44. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP is facing strong selling pressure The 1-day chart for June 21 shows that ICP is under sustained bearish pressure, closing at $4.662 after a 5.30% drop. Price has broken below the key support at $5.011 and is now hovering above the next minor level around $4.594. ICP Momentum is clearly downward, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. The 20-day SMA at $5.353 is far above the current price, reinforcing the downward trend. MACD is firmly bearish with increasing red histogram bars and both MACD and signal lines declining, showing no sign of a reversal. If the $4.443 support breaks, ICP could accelerate its slide toward the $4.20–$4.00 zone. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP 4-hour chart confirms heavy selling pressure and weak recovery attempts The 4-hour chart reinforces the short-term bearish sentiment. ICP recently plunged below the lower Bollinger Band, showing strong selling momentum. Price is now trading at $4.667, below both the middle and upper Bollinger Bands, and also beneath the 20-period SMA at $4.980. ICP 4-hour chart confirms heavy selling pressure and weak recovery attempts The Balance of Power indicator sits deeply negative at -0.45, highlighting that sellers are firmly in control. There was a sharp wick down, indicating some buying interest, but it remains weak. Any recovery attempts may stall around the $4.76 and $4.98 levels unless bulls regain strength swiftly. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.93 SELL SMA 5 $5.18 SELL SMA 10 $5.44 SELL SMA 21 $5.45 SELL SMA 50 $5.36 SELL SMA 100 $5.37 SELL SMA 200 $6.51 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.33 SELL EMA 5 $5.28 SELL EMA 10 $5.20 SELL EMA 21 $5.29 SELL EMA 50 $5.83 SELL EMA 100 $6.83 SELL EMA 200 $7.89 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is showing clear bearish momentum across both the daily and 4-hour charts, with no immediate signs of reversal. Unless buyers step in decisively around the $4.44–$4.59 support zone, the token is likely to continue sliding or consolidating at lower levels. A short-term bounce is possible, but overall sentiment remains tilted to the downside. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Why is ICP down? ICP is down due to general market downturn, negative technical momentum failing to hold key supports (around $5.34–5.00), and waning DeFi activity even as developer engagement grows. ICP price chart | Coinmarketcap Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future. Price predictions indicate steady growth, with a potential increase year-on-year, reflecting a positive trend and strong market potential.

With reduced weekend liquidity expected, price action is likely to remain choppy, making it essential to closely monitor intraday volatility. A clearer setup could take time to develop, but this zone may offer early clues about the token’s next move. Oversold Pressure Builds: Is LINKBTC Ready To Rebound? In his expanded commentary, CRYPTOWZRD underscored that both the LINKUSDT and LINKBTC daily candles closed firmly bearish, mirroring Bitcoin’s broader pullback and highlighting the altcoin market’s continued sensitivity to BTC’s moves. He emphasized that this pattern underscores the need for healthier bullish candles to emerge before a sustainable recovery can take hold. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal Stands Firm, But Bitcoin Is Calling The Shots CRYPTOWZRD stated that LINKBTC sits in extremely oversold territory, suggesting that a positive reversal is statistically likely. Should a bounce materialize, he expects it to ignite a sharp upside spike in LINK, effectively flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish in short order. Turning to absolute price structure, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Chainlink is currently trading right at the $12.50 daily support target, a zone he considers pivotal. A decisive bullish reversal from this level, he argues, is essential to trigger an impulsive upside move and reestablish upward momentum. If buyers can reclaim control, CRYPTOWZRD identifies $16 as the next critical resistance, followed by a more substantial barrier at $19.50. Clearing these levels would signal that the tide has truly shifted, paving the way for a broader trend change rather than a short‑lived bounce. Despite this bullish roadmap, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin’s weekend price action will remain a major influence on Chainlink, especially given the expected drop in liquidity. As a result, he plans to focus on lower‑time‑frame charts in the coming sessions, seeking quick scalp opportunities while waiting for clearer confirmation of direction. Chainlink Intraday Setup Builds Around $12.85 Decision Point Assessing the immediate outlook, the analyst notes that LINK’s intraday chart remains bearish and noticeably volatile, underscoring the market’s current uncertainty. Price action has been chopping around key levels, making any clear direction difficult to trust without firm confirmation. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent? On the bullish side, the analyst points out that a decisive breakout and sustained hold above the $12.85 intraday resistance could flip sentiment. If buyers manage to establish support above this line, the setup would present a compelling long opportunity with an initial upside target near $14.40, where the next significant resistance resides. Conversely, the analyst warns that a failed attempt to hold $12.85—marked by a retest and subsequent decline- would favor the bears. Such rejection would create potential short setups, as renewed selling pressure could drag the price lower, especially if broader market conditions stay cautious.

These projects combine accessibility with strong fundamentals and innovation, making them prime candidates for high returns. From DeFi protocols to AI-powered blockchains and political meme tokens, a small group of undervalued presales are already showing signs of explosive growth potential. Here are five standout tokens crypto insiders are watching and buying before listings go live. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Analyst Support as a 2025 Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a leading force in the current crypto presale cycle. Fueled by a combination of political branding, locked tokenomics, and early-stage investor momentum, the project is setting up for what analysts describe as a potentially explosive launch. The project is built on scarcity, transparency, and long-term tokenomics. The 170 billion token supply is permanently locked. No venture capital control. Fully audited by HashEx. And 100% designed for early investors looking for asymmetric upside. Analysts tracking early-stage altcoins say MAGACOIN FINANCE is already outperforming across watchlists and leaderboards. Additionally, top analysts are forecasting major upside, with projections ranging up to 100x under favorable market conditions. Mutuum Finance: A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making Mutuum Finance has caught investor attention with its innovative dual-lending model and consistent upward trajectory. Its presale phases sold out at a rapid pace, with investor demand pushing each round higher. Analysts are closely watching the token as it heads toward a confirmed listing price that could double early positions instantly. At the heart of Mutuum’s value proposition is a hybrid Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending engine, designed for capital efficiency and long-term staking benefits. The platform continuously buys back its own token and redistributes it to stakers, creating a cycle of organic demand. Security is a top priority, with Mutuum undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK. The platform has also rolled out high-value rewards for top participants, encouraging early and long-term investor commitment. Market analysts say Mutuum Finance may be this year’s breakout DeFi project — especially as momentum accelerates and its on-chain fundamentals outperform newer platforms. Qubetics ($TICS): The Infrastructure-First Blockchain Qubetics is positioning itself at the intersection of infrastructure and interoperability. With token scarcity hardcoded and real-world use cases spanning asset tokenization, decentralized VPNs, and seamless cross-chain value transfer, Qubetics offers more than hype — it offers purpose. The project’s low-code builder, QubeQode, and built-in multi-chain IDE make it easy for developers to deploy on-chain applications, giving it a strategic edge. Demand is surging as investors seek infrastructure plays with lasting utility. Previous presale stages sold out instantly, and the final stage is nearing completion. The listing price will activate shortly, triggering a sharp valuation step-up. Crypto analysts expect Qubetics to perform well post-launch, with token scarcity, real-world functionality, and Layer-1 positioning as key catalysts. Lightchain AI (LCAI): Where Blockchain Meets Intelligence Lightchain AI is making its final presale push ahead of a July 2025 mainnet launch. With a deflationary supply model and a Proof-of-Intelligence consensus layer, the platform rewards validators for completing real AI tasks such as model inference and neural computation. LCAI is not built on hype — it’s built for scale. The upcoming Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) will support AI-focused dApps using major frameworks like PyTorch. Analysts are tracking LCAI’s development milestones and developer grants, seeing it as a top pick among utility-based tokens. The project is expected to stand out from memecoins and speculative tokens by delivering real AI integrations for sectors like logistics, finance, and healthcare. While early post-launch volatility is possible, investor confidence remains high based on technology fundamentals. Remittix (RTX): Solving Crypto-to-Fiat Transfers Remittix is designed to solve a major global bottleneck — fast and reliable crypto-to-fiat payments. Investors are backing the project as a direct play on the $190 trillion global transfer market. Early-stage fundraising success, staking rewards, and a strong governance structure are drawing interest from institutions and seasoned traders. Analysts say RTX could be this cycle’s highest-utility breakout, with a roadmap focused on real adoption rather than hype-driven cycles. The PayFi protocol and direct-to-bank functionality give it a real chance at disrupting both crypto and traditional payment networks. Strategic buyers are now watching RTX closely, anticipating its rise as stablecoin-linked platforms and fast settlement tools gain adoption globally. Conclusion The 2025 cycle is already being shaped by a new generation of tokens built on real use cases, deflationary models, and aggressive investor positioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the top pick thanks to its unmatched momentum, transparent structure, and growing market presence. Mutuum Finance brings powerful utility in the DeFi space, while Qubetics combines scarcity and smart infrastructure for builders. Lightchain AI introduces a fresh angle with AI rewards and innovation, and Remittix bridges the global payments gap with crypto-fiat solutions. For investors watching presales for their next big win, these five tokens represent more than just hype they offer rare access to early-stage growth before the rest of the market catches up.

But 2025 could herald a new champion in the form of Ruvi AI (RUVI) . With an impressive $1.9 million raised in its ongoing presale and over 160 million tokens sold , Ruvi AI is grabbing attention from Tron holders and crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Its unique blend of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has analysts predicting Ruvi AI to be one of the top gainers this year. How Ruvi AI Could Become the Year’s Standout Gainer Tron has built its reputation through its dApp ecosystem and content-sharing capabilities, but Ruvi AI’s utility-driven model stands out in industries ranging from marketing to finance . Unlike tokens that rely purely on hype, Ruvi AI uses its technology to solve genuine real-world problems, ensuring long-term applicability and demand. One of the strongest selling points for Ruvi AI is its structured growth strategy.

These aren’t coins riding on hype alone. They are backed by measurable growth, expanding communities, and clear plans. Whether through strong fundamentals or aggressive ecosystem growth, these projects are actively building their place in the market. BlockDAG currently leads this group by transforming early momentum into wide-reaching adoption. 1. BlockDAG: Real Growth Backed by Strategy & Scale BlockDAG sits at the top of the list of top-performing cryptos today, thanks to its ability to drive results on multiple fronts. The presale has raised $315 million, with the current batch priced at $0.0020 and set to increase to $0.0030 on June 24. Since batch 1, the project has recorded a 2,660% ROI, with over 23 billion coins sold so far. Much of this traction comes from the X1 Miner App, which has brought in more than 2 million users through a tap-to-mine system that’s simple and mobile-first. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is preparing for wider exposure, with confirmed sponsorships in the U.S. to help reach a more mainstream audience. The scale of its $600 million presale is allowing BlockDAG to fund its tech development, global outreach, and user adoption simultaneously. That layered approach makes it a leading name in practical adoption this year. 2. Filecoin: Storage Demand Fuels Renewed Growth Filecoin secures its position among the top-performing cryptos today as decentralized storage gains fresh relevance. The platform is already well-known for hosting data on-chain, and recent growth is linked to rising demand from AI-driven and enterprise-level data sets. With the need for reliable, distributed storage rising, Filecoin’s real-world application continues to drive adoption. This time, the price gains are not speculative, they are being supported by practical use, growing developer interest, and emerging institutional curiosity. 3. Arbitrum: Layer 2 Scaling Gains Real Momentum Arbitrum continues to be one of the top-performing cryptos today, largely due to its Layer 2 rollup tech that enhances Ethereum scalability while preserving security. As the industry shifts toward efficient scaling, Arbitrum has already processed billions in transactions and remains a popular choice for developers. Its recent price increase is supported by new DeFi activity and ecosystem partnerships that are boosting demand. As more users and platforms seek faster and more cost-effective environments, Arbitrum is capturing attention and resources. 4. Cronos: Ecosystem Expansion Supports Steady Climb Cronos is making its way back into the spotlight as one of the top-performing cryptos today, driven by steady advances in gaming, DeFi, and NFT sectors. With support from Crypto.com, Cronos has seen more user activity, developer engagement, and rising transaction volumes. Recent upgrades and new funding programs have added to its appeal, helping to push its price upward. With liquidity incentives and a stronger infrastructure in place, Cronos is rebuilding momentum through consistent, utility-focused development. While it may not grab the loudest headlines, its integration and sustained progress make it worth watching. What Sets the Top Performers Apart Among the top-performing cryptos today , projects like BlockDAG are standing out by combining multiple strengths, capital, reach, and usability. Arbitrum is excelling through efficient scaling, Filecoin through its expanding role in data storage, and Cronos through its multi-sector ecosystem growth. But BlockDAG’s combination of user growth, strategic partnerships, and strong funding positions it on a broader path. It’s not only scaling, it’s executing across infrastructure, outreach, and adoption at once. That kind of full-spectrum performance is what separates long-term builders from short-term plays as 2025 unfolds.

The firm notes in a recent post on the social media platform X that “the utility and growth of the network continues looking healthier than ever.” “The amount of new weekly ETH addresses created is ranging around 800,000-1 million per week, compared to about one-third less at this point last year.” Source: Santiment/X ETH is trading at $2,421 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 3.5% in the past day. Despite Ethereum’s growing network, Santiment notes that a different layer-1 project, Tron ( TRX ), has been dominating the social media conversation. “The Tron blockchain and ecosystem is trending, including its deflationary tokenomics, staking options via Tronscan and TronLink, and its role in stablecoin transactions, especially USDT on Tron. Discussions include token conversions, swapping, and competition with Ethereum in DeFi (decentralized finance) and stablecoin transfers. Tron is also noted for a potential NASDAQ listing and involvement of notable figures, enhancing its prominence. TRX, the native token, is highlighted for fast, low-cost transactions, a growing DeFi, NFT (non-fungible tokens), and dApp ecosystem, surpassing Dogecoin in market cap, and a $210 million reverse merger attracting institutional interest.” TRX is trading at $0.273 at time of writing.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote : “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The impact on crypto was instant. Traders dumped risk as the US joined Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign against Iran. The market panic came after days of speculation that Washington would side with Tel Aviv following Israel’s unilateral strike on Iranian territory — once again citing half a century of unproven nuclear weapons claims. The new US airstrikes have now confirmed its involvement. XRP drops, Ether struggles, Solana hit hardest As Bitcoin slid under the $100,000 line, XRP dropped to $1.8, a 3.1% hit. Ether fell to $2,201, while Solana tumbled harder than the others, now sitting at $121, down over 5%. These moves erased all gains from earlier in the week. Meanwhile shortly after Trump’s post, Israel said it had killed Saeed Izadi, a senior commander in Iran’s Quds Force, during an airstrike on an apartment in Qom. Defense Minister Israel Katz called Izadi’s killing “a major achievement,” claiming he had supplied weapons and money to Hamas before its October 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza. Izadi had been on both US and British sanctions lists. While Israeli forces targeted Izadi in Qom, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed that five of its members died in separate strikes on Khorramabad, though Izadi was not named in their statement. Iranian outlets reported that a 16-year-old was killed and two others wounded in the Qom strike. Iranian state news agency Nour News said that 430 people have been killed and 3,500 injured inside Iran since Israel began bombing on June 13. In retaliation, Iranian missile strikes have killed 24 civilians in Israel, according to Israeli officials. The air war is now dragging both sides into their worst conflict in decades. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said there will be no negotiations with Washington as long as the attacks continue. Speaking in Istanbul during a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Araqchi said, “It is obvious that I can’t go to negotiations with the US when our people are under bombardments under the support of the US.” A day earlier, Araqchi had met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in a last-ditch diplomatic attempt. That effort appears dead now. Trump, speaking Friday, said he would decide “within two weeks” whether to send more US forces to the conflict, depending on whether “people come to their senses.” He also claimed Iran could build a nuclear weapon in weeks, saying, “We can’t let that happen.” Meanwhile, Iran’s Fars News Agency reported that Israel struck the Isfahan nuclear facility, one of the country’s most important atomic sites. It said there were no radioactive leaks, but damage assessments are still underway. Israel also said it launched a wave of attacks on missile storage and launch infrastructure, hitting multiple locations across Iran in a wider campaign.

Hidden among the ocean of digital currencies, three lesser-known tokens are catching their eye. These under-the-radar picks could be primed for rapid growth. Explore which coins are on their radar and why they might be the next big thing in the crypto market. Jito Price Snapshot: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Decline Last month, Jito showed steady gains with a +3.50% price increase, while the past week added another +2.14% to the mix. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a significant decline of about -27.77%, marking a long-term downtrend despite recent short-term improvements. Price fluctuations were evident as the range moved between $1.35 and $2.11, reflecting both quick recoveries and persistent weakness over time. At the current stage, the price sits between a tested support at $1.06 and an immediate resistance level at $2.56, with a broader range that extends to a second resistance at $3.32 and a second support at $0.30. The RSI at 52.96 indicates balanced sentiment, while the momentum indicator at -0.029 adds a slight bearish note. Traders might consider buying near $1.06 and look for a possible bounce, while a drop below this level could trigger a deeper sell-off. A breakthrough above $2.56 could open the door toward $3.32. The coin is currently in a consolidation phase that requires careful observation around these key levels. AB Coin Surge: Massive Gains Amid Key Price Milestones AB performance over the past month shows a remarkable leap with an 83.01% gain, while the half-year statistics reveal an astounding 8974.27% increase. The week-to-week rise of 5.65% adds to a vivid picture of strong upward momentum. Price action has spread from a range of $0.0043 to $0.0116, setting the stage for dynamic market responses. The numbers point to accelerated growth and strong investor sentiment, reflected in substantial price progress over both monthly and half-year time frames. The current market setup revolves around key price markers that guide trading decisions. Trading is occurring between a support level at $0.0004 and nearest resistance at $0.015, with a secondary resistance around $0.0223. Technical indicators show moderate balance with an RSI of 57.16 and a Momentum Indicator of 0.001. Bulls are in play, but caution is advised near resistance. Traders could consider entering long positions if the price holds near resistance or utilize tight stops if it slips toward support, making strategic moves in this bullish phase. Mantle Price Behavior and Key Levels Overview Data from the past month shows a decline of approximately 15% while the half-year performance has decreased by close to 46%. These price drops indicate a consistent downturn characterized by weakening sentiment and reduced buying interest. This erosion of value marks recent times as particularly challenging for the coin, reflecting broader market sentiments and investor reluctance. Currently, Mantle trades in a range between $0.61 and $0.79. Immediate resistance is observed at $0.90, with support near $0.54. Additional levels include $1.08 to the upside and $0.36 on the downside. Indicators such as a relative strength index near 41.84, along with negative momentum, suggest moderate bearish control. The absence of a clear trend presents opportunities for cautious trading, with an emphasis on monitoring the support boundary for potential reversals. A breach of resistance may signal upward movement, highlighting the importance of clearer directional cues before making any commitments. Conclusion JTO , AB , and MNT have shown potential for growth in June. These coins have caught the attention of top investors. Their new features and promising use cases set them apart from others. Monitoring these coins could be beneficial for those looking for future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Notably, the aforementioned tokens are experiencing robust development activity,including institutional interest, and expanding user bases. Meanwhile experienced investors and analysts are increasingly shifting their focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is quickly marking its footprints as the accumulation zone of 2025. Why Analysts Project Strong 2025 Performance for MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting heightened attraction with a wave of its own. With a capped supply, verified security through a HashEx audit, and zero risk of stealth minting, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings a high level of transparency and decentralization. Notably, market pundits, investors and analysts alike are betting that MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most potential for high reward. Large-scale investors are entering early, anticipating returns, driven by a unique tokenomics model and growing momentum in the presale market. Solana: Institutional Endorsements and ETF Catalysts Solana is undeniably strong. Trading between $146 and $157, it holds over $6.5 billion in derivatives open interest. Recent upgrades, including the RPS 2.0 scalability enhancement and a new consensus algorithm to increase block finality speed, have only boosted confidence. But what truly marks Solana’s Q3 as an accumulation zone is the looming ETF approval. VanEck’s spot Solana ETF (VSOL) is now listed on the DTCC website, and approval could come as early as July. Coupled with Solana’s expanding DePIN ecosystem (Helium, Hivemapper, Render), over 11.6 million active wallets, and $8 billion+ in TVL, this is an ecosystem ready to launch. Yet, as attention floods into SOL, early MAGACOIN FINANCE adopters see an opportunity to enter a high-potential project before it reaches such institutional visibility. Cardano: Staking, DeFi, and a Political Tailwind ADA now trading around $0.61–$0.63, ADA is retesting key support, with some analysts warning of a possible drop to $0.50. But others point to a possible rally toward $10 based on DeFi expansion and institutional interest. Staking addresses have surpassed 1.3 million, and the introduction of Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano through Lace Wallet represents a game-changing cross-chain bridge. However, despite these technical and developmental merits, the upside for ADA may be limited by its sheer market maturity. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the start of its journey an altcoin with fresh legs and a growing community. Sei: Quiet Strength and DeSci Disruption SEI’s performance has been quietly impressive. Up 23% in a week and trading at $0.27, SEI is gaining traction through tokenization projects with the Bank of England, a $65 million DeSci grant fund, and rumors of a potential acquisition of 23andMe to revolutionize data privacy. Sei’s ecosystem is thriving with fast decentralized trading via Seiyan DEX, NFT activity on Pallet, and rising ESG credentials. While these fundamentals could push SEI to $0.77 by year-end, it still faces volatility and adoption hurdles. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by comparison, is eliminating uncertainty early laying down a solid infrastructure, community-first incentives, and audit-backed assurances. Final Word There’s no denying that Solana, Cardano, and Sei are accumulating strength but they’re also known quantities with major capital already priced in. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is in the sweet spot: undervalued, early-stage, and surging with presale momentum. With crypto insiders already in and analysts forecasting life-changing ROI potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just forming an accumulation zone it is the accumulation zone to watch this quarter.

Among the leaders in 2025 are Ethereum, Cardano, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, each fueling different layers of crypto growth. While ETH and ADA benefit from historical strength and ecosystem upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most strategically watched tokens in the entire market. Ethereum Holds the Line with Institutional Backing Ethereum has bounced back strongly after underperformance earlier this year, gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours alone. Trading volume exceeded 819,000 ETH as bulls reclaimed control, pushing prices toward the $2,600 resistance zone. What makes ETH stand out now is the growing institutional interest in staking. The Lido Foundation reports an increase in institutional onboarding, potentially boosting long-term network stability and reinforcing Ethereum’s credibility among major players. Investor sentiment remains strong in the U.S. as well, with Coinbase Premium data signaling rising demand from American buyers. If this trend continues, Ethereum could lead the Layer-1 pack into a new leg of the market cycle. Still, analysts advise caution. While bullish momentum is building, early signs of profit-taking and a declining taker buy-sell ratio suggest traders should watch resistance levels closely. Any breakout above $2,560 would open the door to targets at $2,580, $2,610, and $2,650. Cardano: Development Surges While Eyes Stay on the Charts Cardano has delivered strong year-to-date gains, up 55% over the past 12 months. Despite a recent 10% correction, ADA remains active in technical development, with bullish metrics like exchange withdrawals surpassing $900 million since January—a clear signal of whale accumulation. Recent milestones include the UTXO-HD upgrade for scalable storage and wallet integration with Brave, Trust Wallet, and Emurgo. These moves are expanding Cardano’s DeFi capabilities and long-term network strength. Still, Cardano remains a staple in smart contract ecosystems. With TPS scaling simulations and a potential privacy partnership with Litecoin on the horizon, ADA’s relevance is expected to remain strong heading into the second half of the year. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining Traction With High-Conviction Buyers MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025.

Amid announcement of new US trade tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, the premier cryptocurrency has come under bearish influences to trade as low as 101,000. At press time, Bitcoin is hovering near $104,000 following a 2.03% % decline in the past day. However, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted a crucial price range worth monitoring especially in the advent of a further price decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential $95,500–$97,000: Bitcoin’s Line In The Sand In a recent X post, Glassnode shares an insight into the Bitcoin market based on data from Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap. The CBD is a common on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last purchased or sold. When a substantial amount of coins are traded within a specific price range, it forms a supply cluster capable of acting as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode’s report, the Bitcoin’s CBD heatmap shows the first dense supply cluster below the current market price lies at $95,500 – $97,000 price zone. Interestingly, this range rests just below the short-term holders (STH) cost basis suggesting a confluence of technical and on-chain metric to present a high-stake battleground. Therefore, Glassnode analysts explain that holding the market price above this threshold reinforces bullish momentum and boosts Bitcoin chances of re-entering a price discovery mode. However, a breakdown below the $95,500 price level could trigger panic selling supporting bearish projections for the mid-term to short-term. Interestingly, prominent market analysts including anonymous X expert with username Mr. Wall Street has backed the latter scenario stating Bitcoin is due for a further price drops. Mr. Wall Street strictly warns Bitcoin would not hold above the $100,000 psychological support zone forecasting a price fall to around the $93,000 – $95,000 which Glassnode predicts should induce widescale market liquidations.

Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,753 with a cumulative 1.27% decline in the past week. During this period, the flagship cryptocurrency remained largely under $106,000 barring a weak price breakout between June 16 and June 17. On a monthly scale, Bitcoin has now recorded a 6.10% loss, signaling a gradual shift in momentum with bearish forces regaining control of the market. Meanwhile, with a market cap of $2.05 trillion, the “digital gold” continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency with a reported market dominance of 64.3%.

This legislative development introduces a federal framework for regulating stablecoins and is poised to support companies like Ripple as they expand their payment services within the United States. Passed with bipartisan support, the GENIUS Act establishes comprehensive guidelines for the issuance and management of stablecoins backed by the U.S. dollar. Its core objective is to promote financial innovation by delivering regulatory certainty to firms operating in the digital currency space. The legislation also aims to enhance the efficiency of domestic and international payment networks while maintaining the U.S. dollar’s leading role in global finance. Ripple’s Strategic Position in the Stablecoin Ecosystem Ripple entered the stablecoin market in 2024 with the introduction of RLUSD , its U.S. dollar–pegged digital asset. In a relatively short time, RLUSD has reached a market capitalization of $415 million, establishing Ripple as a notable participant in the compliant digital finance sector. The firm’s expansion efforts have been supported at the state level, with regulatory approvals secured in jurisdictions such as New York and Texas. In addition, Ripple holds more than 50 money transmitter licenses across various U.S. states. These licenses authorize the company to offer cross-border payment services to financial institutions, leveraging both XRP and RLUSD. Implications of the GENIUS Act for Ripple and the Broader Market The GENIUS Act complements Ripple’s ongoing regulatory compliance efforts by providing a unified national structure for stablecoin regulation. XRP community researcher “SMQKE” recently emphasized on social media that Ripple’s RLUSD is already aligned with the Act’s regulatory expectations. RIPPLE IS LEGALLY ALLOWED TO OFFER CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT SERVICES TO U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS USING RLUSD AND XRP Documented. https://t.co/bxNKD2B4GP pic.twitter.com/0XZPqK8gIH — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 19, 2025 RLUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and short-term government securities, with independent monthly attestations verifying its reserves. According to SMQKE, as RLUSD sees increased institutional adoption, the associated use of XRP will also grow. Since transaction fees on the XRP Ledger are paid in XRP and then permanently removed from circulation, this could gradually reduce the overall supply of the token, potentially influencing its value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The GENIUS Act also helps position RLUSD and XRP as viable alternatives to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), particularly within a defined and enforceable legal structure. This clarity may improve institutional confidence and accelerate adoption across financial markets. Forward Momentum and Market Speculation The bill is now under consideration in the House of Representatives. President Donald Trump has publicly urged lawmakers to approve the legislation without delay, citing its importance in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in financial technology. Some XRP proponents, such as Chad Steingraber , have expressed optimism about the long-term price outlook for the asset. They argue that regulatory milestones like the GENIUS Act could support ambitious growth targets, including projections of XRP reaching $250. While future outcomes remain speculative, the alignment of federal and state policies with Ripple’s business model may prove to be a critical enabler of its cross-border payment ambitions using both XRP and RLUSD.

JPMD will cater to institutions that want the legal protections , interest payments, and bank integration that regular stablecoins don’t fully offer to move money quickly, safely, and around the clock. JPMD combines traditional banking features with blockchain speed and access on a public blockchain (Base, built on Ethereum) to attract big institutions who fear stablecoins like USDC or USDT will raise concerns about regulation, stability, and trust. But will deposit tokens like JPMD completely replace stablecoins for institutional use, or will they simply serve different purposes and grow side by side? How are deposit tokens different from stablecoins? Deposit tokens fit into commercial banks’ existing financial and legal framework because they come with added benefits, like deposit insurance, interest payments, and accounting clarity for managing large volumes of funds. On the other hand, stablecoins don’t enjoy the same trust or integration with banks because the US Congress is still debating the rules around using and backing them. In addition, the openness and availability of stablecoins for trading, remittances, lending, DeFi protocols, and as a fast way to store and move value across borders have helped them grow into a $260 billion market. Constrastly, deposit coins set large transactions, enable tokenized securities, handle business-to-business payments, and manage digital cash in a way that ties back to a real-world bank account to serve the complex needs of institutions. So, while stablecoins operate outside the bounds of traditional finance and serve a wide global audience, deposit tokens help the banks move money faster and more efficiently within the trusted, regulated walls of the banking system. Why does JPMorgan believe JPMD is better for institutions? JPMD combines the convenience of blockchain with the confidence and structure of commercial banking for institutional users who need digital money that moves fast but also complies with strict legal, financial, and operational standards. JPMorgan hosts JPMD on the Base blockchain (a public Layer 2 network built by Coinbase on top of Ethereum) to protect it from misuse or unwanted exposure and allow only verified institutional clients to interact with the system. This way, the bank creates access to faster settlements and lower fees while controlling who uses the token through permissioned access. The Base blockchain bridges JPMD to future blockchain use cases with its connection to Ethereum’s broader ecosystem. Businesses can also use JPMD in treasury operations, accounting systems, and financial reports without the extra friction that comes with third-party stablecoins. This is because the token allows them to treat it like cash they already hold in their JPMorgan accounts. Accountants, CFOs, and risk officers can easily trust, track, and report JPMD tokens because they are tied directly into the bank’s own infrastructure. This differs from stablecoins that sit outside the banking system and may raise questions about compliance or reserve backing. JPMorgan also said JPMD will likely pay interest while still providing instant settlement and on-chain liquidity. This will make it more appealing as a long-term financial tool for institutions with large cash balances and wanting their funds to generate yield. The token may also become insured like bank deposits to reduce risk and offer a level of protection that stablecoins currently can’t match in high-value transactions. Moreover, JPMD makes it easier for institutions to incorporate blockchain-based transactions without overhauling their internal workflows or facing delays due to incompatible systems. The token integrates seamlessly with enterprise treasury platforms, payment processing tools, and settlement engines. It also supports financial reporting systems to manage cash flow, settle trades, facilitate cross-border payments, and ensure regulatory compliance. Businesses can also settle payments across jurisdictions instantly with JPMD to reduce delays, high costs, and limited operating hours in cross-border business-to-business (B2B) payments and tokenized asset settlements. What could stop deposit tokens from taking over? Deposit tokens have less potential as a universal digital cash solution because JPMD is only available to pre-approved institutional clients connected to the bank. While anyone with a crypto wallet can access and use stablecoins, the permissioned nature of deposit tokens prevents smaller businesses, startups, or individuals from accessing the token, despite it running on a public blockchain. Banks using or issuing these tokens may face strict capital requirements and other compliance burdens. This is because current Basel guidelines classify digital tokens operating on public, permissionless blockchains as high-risk assets. These institutions may be constrained by rules that make large-scale deployment expensive, risky, or not worth the effort, unless the Basel Committee updates its guidance or makes exceptions for well-structured deposit tokens. Moreover, JPMD may end up being siloed within a limited ecosystem because many institutions and platforms may prefer Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Avalanche, or private blockchains for their digital asset strategies over its Layer 2 network built on Ethereum (Base). In contrast, Stablecoins like USDC and USDT are highly attractive to developers, fintech companies, crypto exchanges, and users in emerging markets who want to move value across platforms without worrying about permissioned access or network compatibility. These stablecoins operate on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. They have a wide global reach, widespread wallet support, and integration with decentralized applications. Similarly, smaller firms, fintechs, and international businesses may not have the technical infrastructure, legal clarity, or compliance capabilities that large institutions require to work with a permissioned token tied to a US bank. Firms operating in multiple regions or jurisdictions may not want to maintain a relationship with a specific bank to undergo a complex onboarding process. It may be difficult for deposit tokens to reach the scale and utility that stablecoins have already achieved when their growth is limited to a small circle of elite users. JPMD and similar tokens remain too tightly linked to individual banking ecosystems. Stablecoins and deposit tokens will likely grow side by side The infrastructure around digital tokens and stablecoins will decide which models succeed and at what scale as banks, governments, and global companies continue to experiment with tokenized assets, digital payments, and programmable money. Both stablecoins and deposit tokens could grow together, serving different types of users and use cases if public blockchains become widely accepted as safe, reliable environments for moving real-world value. It’s unlikely that either stablecoins or deposit tokens will completely replace the other, so the more realistic outcome is coexistence. Deposit tokens will likely dominate in highly regulated, high-value environments where trust, control, and integration with existing systems are essential. On the other hand, stablecoins will continue to lead in areas where openness, speed, and accessibility matter most, such as retail payments, global remittances, and decentralized applications.

SHIB’s latest price drop, attributed to broader market corrections and a cooling-off in meme coin momentum, highlights the volatility still embedded in many altcoins. Meanwhile, a lesser-known name, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has quietly surged in both price and visibility, sparking conversations among those tracking crypto news today. The Mutuum Finance official presale has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, ahead of an increase in Phase 6 to $0.035. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when the presale started, Mutuum Finance will officially go live at $0.06, giving current buyers a minimum 100% return on investment. Unlike speculative meme tokens, Mutuum Finance is gaining ground due to its real-world DeFi use cases, which have helped it stand out in the market. As traders reassess what crypto to invest in amid fluctuating crypto prices today, MUTM is becoming increasingly hard to ignore, with some already speculating it could be the next big cryptocurrency to break out from the current market noise. Mutuum Finance Presale Piles on Momentum as Investor Excitement Thunder Mutuum Finance is quickly growing as a leading altcoin project ahead of its official launch in 2025, as strong buying demand comes from both retail and institutional investors alike. As each presale stage sells out faster than anticipated, momentum for this new DeFi kingmaker builds. After a quick Phase 4 sellout, the project is currently in Phase 5, selling tokens at $0.03. The phase has a potential 16.67% return for early backers since the price will increase in the next phase. So far, over 12,300 investors have joined the presale, investing over $10.9 million, proof irrefutable of the growing confidence in Mutuum Finance’s vision and future prospects. With its innovative dual-lending platform and upcoming launch of a USD-pegged stablecoin, Mutuum Finance continues to distinguish itself in the crowded crypto landscape, not through hype, but through true utility and security at scale. The road ahead is clear, and the innovative features have tremendous potential that Mutuum Finance is well-placed to become one of the best altcoin investment prospects. Smart Tokenomics Set Mutuum Finance Apart Mutuum finance is built to be sustainable and not a victim of the price volatility of mostly overhyped crypto projects like Shiba Inu. Its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism will purchase tokens in the market from time to time and redistributes them to stakers. This encourages long-term holding, dampens volatility in the market, and pushes the value of the token, so long-term loyal investors get a significant advantage in the long run. Stablecoin Release and CertiK Audit Imbue Institutional Trustworthiness Mutuum Finance’s much anticipated launch of a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum is one of the solid pillars of this vision. It’s designed to withstand market fluctuations and provide a stable alternative to failed algorithmic stablecoins which have destabilized past DeFi ecosystems. Mutuum Finance has also been exposed to a strenuous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the most well-respected cybersecurity firms in the blockchain market. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) slides by 10% over the past 7 days, the spotlight is shifting fast toward high-utility projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a DeFi contender that’s turning heads for all the right reasons. With more than $10.9 million raised from over 12,300 investors and a current presale price of just $0.03, MUTM offers a projected 100% ROI at its confirmed launch price of $0.06. Backed by a CertiK audit, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and a dual lending system that prioritizes real-world usability, Mutuum Finance is setting a new standard in DeFi innovation. Skip the hype and secure your position in a project built for growth, join the presale before Phase 6 hits.

Good year for XRP XRP’s path in 2025 has been defined by its legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ripple’s big win over the SEC this spring really changed the game for XRP. After agreeing to a settlement—yes, there was a fine, but Ripple also got back a chunk of its escrowed funds and saw those restrictive court orders lifted—suddenly the path to U.S. markets feels a lot clearer. You can practically feel the doors opening: futures-based XRP ETFs are already trading, and the buzz around a spot ETF approval grows louder every day. Investors who had been on the sidelines seem ready to jump back in, and charts are showing that once XRP pushes through its next hurdle, we could be looking at a fresh wave of buying. In short, the regulatory fog has lifted, and XRP is poised to be one of the first beneficiaries. Importantly, Ripple’s sustained accumulation of XRP on its balance sheet and its cooperative stance toward regulators underscore the company’s commitment to fostering a compliant, widely embraced payment network. Bitcoin BTC is The Bedrock of Crypto Portfolios Bitcoin is still the go-to when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Even with the headlines swirling about geopolitical unrest, it’s held steady above key price levels—proof that investors see it as a reliable anchor in a choppy market. Long-term projections for Bitcoin hinge on its dual role as both a digital store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic turbulence. Major financial institutions continue to allocate a fraction of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, while emerging investment vehicles—such as debt securities backed by BTC—have broadened market access. Technical analysts observe that Bitcoin is consolidating within a well-defined trading range; a sustained breakout to the upside could ignite fresh buying interest from both retail and professional investors. Moreover, the limited supply mechanism coded into Bitcoin’s protocol bolsters its scarcity narrative. As adoption deepens in sectors ranging from corporate treasuries to central bank experiments, Bitcoin’s position as the leading, most secure blockchain protocol remains unchallenged. For those building a core digital-asset holding, no alternative combines liquidity, brand recognition, and regulatory headroom quite like Bitcoin. Aptos: Innovation at the Vanguard of Layer-1 Blockchains Aptos has carved out a reputation as one of 2025’s most dynamic Layer-1 networks. Backed by performance-driven architecture and a growing roster of DeFi and data-feed integrations, Aptos offers both scalability and developer-friendly tooling. Recent months have seen the network integrate industry-standard oracles and onboard major lending protocols into its testnet environment, underscoring its commitment to robust, real-world use cases. Beyond purely technical metrics, Aptos has made strategic moves on the corporate front—acquiring overseas development teams and establishing regional outposts to foster deeper partnerships. Its leadership’s willingness to engage directly with regulators, including scheduled appearances before key U.S. legislative committees, signals a mature approach to compliance and governance. For long-term investors, Aptos represents exposure to next-generation blockchain capabilities that aim to support high-throughput applications without sacrificing security. As the network transitions token standards and expands its asset base, early adopters of Aptos stand to benefit from both protocol-level upgrades and ecosystem growth. Why investors want in on MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly emerged as a standout in the 2025 altcoin cycle.The project cemented its token model by finalizing a fixed supply and reopening its presale to renewed investor interest. With a HashEx-audited smart contract and a pledge of 100% community ownership—free of venture capital control—the project emphasizes transparency and grassroots engagement. Upcoming staking rewards promise to deepen utility and incentivize long-term holding, reinforcing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s appeal as an early-stage opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers exposure to innovative tokenomics and community-driven governance, rounding out a strategy designed for sustained performance in 2025 and beyond. Analysts are already projecting 40x-70x ROI by the end of the year. Final Thoughts- Portfolio Implications for Long-Term Investors By combining regulatory-cleared XRP, time-tested Bitcoin, growth-oriented Aptos, and innovative MAGACOIN FINANCE, investors can achieve a diversified and balanced crypto allocation. Each asset brings a distinct catalyst profile, ranging from legal milestones and technical consolidation to ecosystem expansion.

According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain , the wallet sent 3.527 million TRUMP tokens, valued at approximately $32.8 million, to Binance on Friday. The move occurred just 30 minutes before the public became aware of it. This is not the only one. Since 28th April, the wallets affiliated with the team have now moved 12.54 million TRUMP tokens to different crypto exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Bybit. The cumulative value of such transfers is around $150.68 million, sent in four separate tranches. Binance inflows fuel speculation over imminent sell-off The most recent transfer came from a wallet identified as “Official Trump Meme? Squads Vault.” First, it sends the tokens through another intermediary wallet, and then the same amount is sent into Binance’s hot wallet. A smaller transfer of 189 TRUMP, worth just $1,760, occurred just before the larger deposit. There’s been no confirmed sale, although large deposits to centralized exchanges are often seen as a precursor to a sell-off. This has prompted concerns among some traders that there could be downward price pressure on the token. The politically sensitive TRUMP coin has surged in value in recent months thanks to increased enthusiasm for memes and election-year hype. Yet should liquidation take place, such substantial inflows to exchanges have the potential to change the market. The last significant TRUMP transaction occurred on June 4, in which more than $46.9 million TRUMP was transferred to several exchanges simultaneously. The type and magnitude of recent transfers indicate one potential approach to reduce risk or monetize peak prices. To make it more mysterious, another whale had moved TRUMP coins of $143 million to an unknown wallet just a day before the latest deposit on Binance. Surges in inflows to exchanges such as Binance are typically a precursor to price turbul ence. Investors are waiting to see whether this transfer is the beginning of a larger sell-off or simply a strategic reorganization of assets in the days ahead. Eric Trump calms crypto rift as family-backed firm commits to major TRUMP coin purchase Just recently, Eric Trump suggested that internal tensions within Donald Trump’s growing crypto empire have begun to ease. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) Friday, he announced that the Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial plans to purchase a “substantial” amount of the meme coin at the center of the recent dispute. According to Eric, the group behind the Trump-themed token has decided not to move forward with a controversial digital wallet offering that had sparked a rift with World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture partially owned by the Trump family. The statement came just a day after Bloomberg reported that World Liberty Financial had issued a cease-and-desist letter to Fight Fight Fight, the organization behind the TRUMP memecoin. The letter challenged their development of the “$TRUMP Wallet,” which World Liberty viewed as a conflict, especially as it was preparing to launch its own competing wallet. The cease-and-desist has not been made public. However, a source familiar with the matter confirmed its existence, highlighting the internal battle for control and branding rights within Trump’s increasingly lucrative crypto ecosystem. According to Eric Trump, World Liberty plans to buy a “substantial” amount of the Trump meme coin for its own holdings. Both World Liberty and the meme coin have been lightning rods for criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accuse Trump of using the crypto projects as vehicles to enrich himself and his family by selling influence and access to the president. The White House and the president’s sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., have repeatedly denied the allegations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

What may appear on the surface as lateral price action is, in fact, a critical phase of accumulation across select digital assets. Analysts and institutional trackers are paying close attention to specific altcoins showing renewed signals of momentum. Among them, three names are beginning to dominate the conversation: XRP, Avalanche (AVAX), Dogecoin, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP Regulatory Doors Now Open The regulatory narrative surrounding XRP has shifted dramatically. With Ripple’s multi-year legal standoff reaching a long-awaited resolution, institutional observers are recalibrating their stance. Institutional ETF filings, particularly the approval of futures-based products and increasing speculation around spot listings, are fueling renewed interest. Industry trackers have noted an uptick in wallet-level accumulation by larger holders, a pattern historically associated with long-term conviction. Analysts forecast that the resolution of legal uncertainties is not just removing barriers—it’s unlocking pathways to global adoption, particularly among financial institutions previously sidelined by risk concerns. Momentum metrics show that XRP is gaining from more than legal relief. Futures markets are expanding, on-chain transactions are accelerating, and industry sentiment is trending bullish. The stage is set for XRP to transition from defensive play to a growth asset. AVAX Blockchain Utility Meets Real-World Integration Avalanche is capturing attention for reasons far beyond speculation. Its novel subnet architecture and enterprise-level use cases are reshaping how institutions approach blockchain deployment. From real estate tokenization to global trade authentication, AVAX is at the forefront of merging traditional systems with decentralized tech. This quarter, several strategic deployments have elevated Avalanche’s visibility. Real-world asset integration with property systems and cross-border trade applications is reinforcing AVAX as a viable backbone for scalable, compliant digital infrastructure. Technical upgrades focused on transparency, such as Proof of Reserves, are strengthening its DeFi credentials and expanding institutional trust. Forecasts from multiple analyst desks place AVAX on a strong growth trajectory through 2025 and beyond. Its ecosystem momentum, especially in gaming, digital collectibles, and finance, continues to scale as new integrations go live. Dogecoin’s Payment-Driven Revival in Motion Dogecoin has re-entered strategic discussions—but for reasons that go beyond its memetic origins. Behind the scenes, the token is undergoing a transformation that’s attracting serious institutional eyes. Developments aimed at improving transaction speed and positioning DOGE as a viable payment method are sparking renewed whale interest. Whale accumulation trends show a steady increase in DOGE holdings across key addresses. Institutional filings and foundation-level initiatives aimed at improving transaction utility signal that DOGE is no longer just a community-driven token—it’s entering structured use-case territory. ETF filings are adding to the momentum, with early indications pointing to increased mainstream exposure. Analysts are watching resistance levels closely. If DOGE clears critical price points, it could re-establish itself as one of the most active altcoins in circulation. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as the Altcoin to Watch Meanwhile, a new force is emerging in real-time. MAGACOIN FINANCE is no longer quietly building—it’s accelerating. Early-stage interest has already transitioned into significant buyer momentum, with crypto insiders rapidly moving in. This isn’t just another project riding market hype. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strength from a structural advantage—its capped supply model. This feature is attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers seeking a high-performance digital asset. Strategic analyst desks are flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a key watchlist name for 2025, pointing to its infrastructure readiness and market-timed expansion. As major campaigns prepare to launch and listings approach, high-volume investor demand is already setting the tone. With utility and growth built into its core, this altcoin is rapidly transforming into a front-runner. Final Thoughts The second quarter of 2025 is shaping up to be a turning point in crypto, and strategic capital matters more than short-term cycles. Yet amid these resets , MAGACOIN FINANCE is not waiting to be discovered. It’s building momentum with every passing day. Investor demand is surging, fueled by active integration layers, and a limited token supply structure. Analysts are already tracking it as a potential cycle leader, pointing to the early traction and mounting interest from high-volume buyers. Every signal—from trading desks to blockchain analysts—suggests that MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just gaining ground. For those watching closely, this may be the window where positioning early could redefine their 2025 return profile.

BlockDAG, Stellar (XLM), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Solana (SOL) are some of the most popular cryptos in 2025, each bringing different strengths and future plans. BlockDAG (BDAG) improves both speed and decentralisation by using a structure unlike traditional blockchains. Stellar is being welcomed into mainstream finance as more institutions use it. Shiba Inu gains support through its loyal user base, and Solana stands out in Layer 1 tech progress. This article breaks down the latest news and performance of these most popular cryptos in 2025 to help readers see which ones stand out most. BlockDAG: Upgrading How Blockchain Works BlockDAG changes how blockchain systems work by moving away from the old methods. Instead of single chains, it allows several blocks to be added and confirmed at once, boosting speed and reducing delays. This model also helps increase fairness and reduces common delays found in most systems. With its Proof of Work system, BlockDAG (BDAG) currently confirms 10 blocks every second and aims to hit 100 soon. It also builds a stronger network by offering useful apps and learning materials for users. The focus is on including more people and making the system easy to use. As of now, BlockDAG has raised $314.5 million in its presale. The price is set at $0.0020, and over 23 billion coins have been sold. Since the first batch, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds. With the GO LIVE reveal already completed and 20 exchange listings confirmed, the project is heading toward its next major goal. These moves show why BlockDAG is considered one of the most popular cryptos in 2025. Stellar (XLM): Building Ties with Finance Stellar (XLM) continues to gain attention for its solid platform that can handle real-world payments. The current price is $0.25. Though price swings are present, it keeps a solid position in the market. Its listing in the Nasdaq Crypto Index and support from big names like Franklin Templeton shows its push into global finance. With growing work on safety and better speed, Stellar is ready to take on more users and larger trades. That’s why it’s counted among the most popular cryptos in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB): More Than Just a Meme Shiba Inu (SHIB) still draws strong support from its active community and keeps moving forward. Priced at $0.00001172, it reacts to both user interest and market changes. Even with market pressure, SHIB’s token burning has gone up, cutting supply. The Shibarium network is also growing, showing more wallets and wider use. These updates highlight how SHIB is growing past its meme roots and gaining ground as one of the most popular cryptos in 2025. Solana (SOL): Strong in Blockchain Growth Solana (SOL) stays ahead in the Layer 1 space by offering speed and power for DeFi and NFT projects. With over 11.6 million wallets, its use is clearly widespread. Prices move between $144 and $154 as it stays on people’s watchlists. Though price levels have held it back recently, planned project launches like Solaxy’s ICO could drive it forward. Solana keeps proving its growth through user activity and developer input, making it one of the most popular cryptos in 2025. Final Thoughts! Heading into 2025, BlockDAG, Stellar, Shiba Inu, and Solana are shaping the next stage of crypto progress. From BlockDAG’s $314.5 million presale and early growth, to Stellar’s push into finance, SHIB’s rising use, and Solana’s strong tech base, these names all bring something solid to the table. Looking closely at these most popular cryptos in 2025 helps users spot which ones have strong support and future plans. Each project offers something different, giving room for better choices in the fast-changing crypto space.

This drop in network activity has sparked divided opinions between two expert analysts, with one casting doubts on XRP’s ability to reclaim the $3 mark, and the other rejecting such bearish predictions. XRP Price Surge To $3 Stalled In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, crypto analyst the ‘Coin Bureau’ highlights that XRP’s momentum appears to be fading fast as new on-chain data from Glassnode reveals a staggering 80% drop in wallet creation since January 2025. This sharp decline in network activity and growth has led the analyst to claim that the XRP price is unlikely to revisit the $3 level anytime soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight At the height of XRP’s 2024 rally, both its price and user activity surged in tandem. During that time, new wallet addresses soared to nearly 30,000 per day in November, coinciding with a sharp rally that sent the token’s price surging close to $3. However, the explosive rally proved short-lived, as momentum faded and prices have since reversed. As of mid-June 2025, Glassnode chart shows that new wallet creation has fallen drastically to around 2,000-5,000 per day, while daily active addresses plunged from 577,000 to just 34,000. XRP’s price, meanwhile, has settled just above $2 and has remained largely range-bound, failing to show signs of a sustained breakout. According to Coin Bureau, this significant drop in on-chain engagement indicates that interest in XRP may have dried up, removing one of the key drivers behind its previous rally. Without new users entering the ecosystem or existing ones increasing XRP’s on-chain activity, the analyst warns that the conditions necessary for an immediate $3 price reclaim aren’t present. Analyst Debunks Bearish Forecast While Coin Bureau’s data paints a picture of declining interest and slow price growth, one crypto expert, known as Moon Lambo on X, has pushed back against the bearish narrative. He argues that XRP’s network activity actually reflects growing strength and long-term confidence. The chart presented by the analyst, covering wallet creation data from June 2024 to June 2025, shows an undeniable spike in network activity between November and early January—a surge that peaked during a period of heightened market enthusiasm following the US elections. As the post-election euphoria faded and investor sentiment cooled off, XRP’s on-chain metrics, like daily new account creations, naturally returned to lower levels. Moon Lambo indicates that this drop does not reflect weakness in the XRP ecosystem, as Coin Bureau claimed. The analyst argues that the decline in activity was a healthy correction that occurred right after an abnormal spike in activity driven by macro excitement, and not a reflection of any breakdown in XRP’s fundamentals. To further support the bullish thesis, Moon Lambo pointed out that Google Trends shows that search interest in Bitcoin has declined significantly, confirming that the lull in on-chain activity is not exclusive to just XRP but reflective of a broader market cool-off.

Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE, a new market player, is already seizing the moment. Bitcoin Testing Key Levels Bitcoin kicked off June with a slight correction that saw the token plummet from $111,000 to around $104,000 by mid-month. It’s currently testing its 50-day simple moving average, a critical technical support. Notably, if this level fails to hold, analysts warn BTC could dip below $100,000. Still, optimism hasn’t disappeared. Many short-term traders are eyeing a potential breakout to $120,000. A high-volume close above $110,000 would reignite bullish sentiment. Longer-term trends suggest strength. Bitcoin is in the third year of its typical four-year cycle, historically its most explosive phase. If past cycles repeat, BTC could climb over 120% in 2025, potentially touching $205,000 before year-end. On-chain data backs this up, with the Realized Cap metric hitting all-time highs, signaling strong accumulation by long-term holders. XRP Stuck, But Loaded With Potential XRP has been trapped in a tight range between $2.10 and $2.40 for more than 200 days. The longest sideways move since its 2018–2020 slump. Currently trading between $2.13 and $2.26, it’s struggling to break past $2.30–$2.50 resistance. Technical indicators paint a hopeful picture. A falling wedge formation and MACD crossover signal bullish momentum building. A breakout above $2.50 could trigger a rally toward $3 or higher. Some bold forecasts put XRP targets at $8, $12, or even $19 in this cycle. Iif legal clarity and institutional adoption fall in line. But if it fails to break resistance, a dip toward $2.00 remains possible. The $28.7 billion market cap shows it’s still a heavyweight, but for now, it’s in limbo. Aptos Quietly Gaining Strength Aptos (APT) is showing signs of breakout potential. Recently, APT climbed past the $5 mark, signaling a possible bullish flag pattern. Now, the digital asset trades between $5.04 and $5.06. This has been supported by strong volume and accumulation patterns. Even after a 19% monthly decline, investor interest hasn’t faded. On June 12, a token unlock event released 1.79% of its circulating supply, causing volatility. At the same time, this also cleared a hurdle for future growth. It is worth mentioning that the network hosts over 1,000 developers and 300+ new Web3 projects, including major strides in gaming and NFTs. Its total value locked (TVL) has reportedly surged past $800 million, and possibly even $3 billion. With a market cap of $2.85 billion and 641 million tokens circulating, Aptos holds strong upside potential. Analysts forecast a 2025 range between $9 and $21. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Strong Entrance Into Q4 MAGACOIN FINANCE i s attracting heightened attention from investors, and analysts due to its deeply held values, understanding their impact. Backed by a capped supply, fully audited by blockchain security firm HashEx, and boasting strong investor confidence, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a top contender. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already staged with momentum, evidently, previous stages sold out instantly. On-chain data shows rising whale interest, and large presale allocations have already been scooped up. Its appeal lies in its community-first model, transparency, and strategic timing. Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE could outpace even the top-tier assets in the coming months, with some projecting explosive gains of up to 23,800%.

Bitcoin has struggled to move back to the all-time high, while most altcoins have had a deeper crash. This report provides a forecast for top altcoins like Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Chainlink (LINK). Cardano price forecast ADA price chart | Source: TradingView Cardano token has been in a strong downtrend this year as it crashed from $1.3270 in December to $0.55 today. Most recently, it has crashed for seven consecutive days and is hovering at its lowest level since April. Cardano has formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossed each other. This cross is one of the most bearish signs in technical analysis. ADA price has also moved below the key support at $0.6182, its lowest swing on June 6. Most oscillators have also continued falling this month, a sign that the downward trend is gaining momentum. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $0.5150, its lowest swing on April 7 and February 3. This price is also the lower side of the descending triangle pattern, a popular continuation sign. A drop below that level will point to more downside, potentially to the support at $0.4535. A move above the resistance point at $0.6182 will invalidate the bearish outlook. Chainlink price prediction LINK price chart | Source: TradingView Chainlink price has crashed in the past few weeks, mirroring the performance of most altcoins. It has plunged from a high of $17.85 on May 12 to the current $11.90. The ongoing crash happened after it formed an ascending channel, which connected the highest and lowest swings since April 7. LINK price has moved below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, while the Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all pointed downwards. It has also dropped below the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support at $10, the lowest point on April 7. A jump above the 200-day moving average at $15 will cancel the bearish outlook. Shiba Inu price forecast SHIB price chart | Source: TradingView Shiba Inu, a once highly popular meme coin, has become a fallen angel as its crash accelerated. SHIB has plunged from a high of $0.00003342 in December to $0.00001080 today. It is loitering at the lowest swing since April 9. Most recently, Shiba Inu price dived below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It is also eying the lowest swing on $0.00001030, the lowest level this year. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has rallied, a sign that the downtrend momentum is strong. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it continues falling as sellers target the next key support at $0.00001030. A move below that level will point to more downside.

It just saw a sudden rejection. Fun’s market structure has shifted slightly in the past few days following a steady price growth in the past few days. This development resulted from increasing demand and is now bullish following a significant price surge over the past 24 hours. So far, it’s been a fantastic week for the asset as it saw a major rally in the past few days. This came following a consistent surge after staying well above the $0.00 level on Monday. Currently, the bulls are technically back in control, aiming to reclaim the lost $0.01 level. Pushing above this key level should set the market up for bigger gains in the near term. A rejection under this level has activated a slight pullback on the lower timeframe, though a rebound is expected. Failure to bounce back could result in a roll over to the current weekly low. An extension below this low could bring the bears back. While the bulls are still in charge of the market, the trend appears shifted to the upside. If they lose control, Fun’s bears may join the latest market meltdown as the crypto sentiment has slowly turned negative in the past few days. Fun’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The recently flipped $0.004 level is considered a close support in case of a pullback. The main support level is located at $0.0031. A breakdown there could plunge the price to $0.0026 in no time. A recovery above the daily rejected high of $0.0084 could bring us back to last month’s $0.01 resistance, with a potential explosion to a new yearly high of $0.015.

While signalling a trend shift, the market structure appears bullish on the day as it forms a double-bottom pattern. Following market ups and downs since the start of the second quarter, SEI finally found solid ground and regained strength on the daily chart. This came after reestablishing support above the $0.15 level earlier this week, and as we can see, the price resurged and increased consistently until it crossed over a month resistance line yesterday. While this signals a trend shift, the crypto is steadily gaining traction daily. Considering the latest price actions, we can say the bulls are back in control on the daily chart. A daily surge above $0.28 should confirm a neckline breakout of the double-bottom pattern before rallying hard on the short-term scale. The reverse would be the case if it dips below April’s low. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the crypto market is surrounded by a negative sentiment due to the recent drop in Bitcoin’s price. If SEI follows suit, it may take a downturn until it finds solid ground for a rebound. As of now, it shows signs of bullishness on the daily chart. SEI’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The main obstacle for the bulls right now is the $0.274 resistance level. Overcoming it should validate a breakout to $0.347 – February’s high – and potentially $0.434. In case of a pullback, SEI may retest the $0185 level (coincides with the broken resistance line) as support before rebounding. The main holding support levels are $0.159 and $0.13.

Bitcoin's price action is mixed versus gold and equities, with recent consolidation and divergence from traditional risk assets raising caution. Potential downside support levels are near $98,000, with risk-off catalysts like geopolitical tensions or weak economic data threatening further declines. Corporate and retail buying provide a floor, but I remain neutral until a breakout above $112,000 or a retest of key support levels occurs. Like so many asset classes and industry groups, the mantra is “wait and see” in the crypto space. Bitcoin holds below its May all-time high near $112,000 heading into the second half, and I am downgrading the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) from a buy to a hold. I was bullish on the world’s largest cryptocurrency back in March , following the steep selloff that ensued after the January peak around President Trump’s inauguration. Up a fast 24% in just a few months since my sanguine call, I am concerned about IBIT’s momentum. Let’s roll through the key crypto charts and tables that may offer clues about where bitcoin may go in the months ahead. Bitcoin Hovers Below Its May All-Time High Seeking Alpha According to the issuer , IBIT aims to generally track the performance of the bitcoin price. The ETF now houses more than $70 billion in assets under management, and it enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. First, it’s important to point out that bitcoin, along with gold and ex-US stocks, have offered some of the best total returns so far this year. So, absolute momentum is not bad when zooming out. But the ultimate breakout IBIT bulls had hoped for in May has not come to pass. YTD Absolute and Risk-Adjusted Returns: Bitcoin Strong Goldman Sachs In the past few years, we’ve seen bitcoin buck gold trends. For instance, when gold rallies, bitcoin has generally consolidated or even drifted lower; when gold trades sideways, that’s usually when we see IBIT thrust higher. Since gold notched a record high close to $3,500 per ounce two months ago, bitcoin has not enjoyed the same kind of buying pressure as seen in previous cycles. That’s a yellow flag for me. Of course, IBIT is up 11% so far in 2025, outperforming the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) by more than eight percentage points. The bitcoin ETF remains significantly below gold’s impressive 28% YTD advance, however. So, the relative strength situation is mixed, depending on if you compare bitcoin to the S&P 500 or the precious metal. Gold Leading Bitcoin YTD, Both Beating the SPX StockCharts.com On an absolute price trend basis, bitcoin has chopped around for more than a month now, and amid geopolitical turmoil and a sagging US Dollar Index (DXY), I’d have liked to have seen better price action with IBIT. Moreover, the Nasdaq 100 ETF ( QQQ ) has been in rally mode, for the most part, since early May. Often, with the Qs ascend, IBIT follows suit. Once again, we’re not seeing that today—another caution sign, in my view. BTCUSD Consolidating From $101,000 to $112,000 Trading Economics Where might we see buyers step up to the plate with bitcoin? I assert now is the ideal time to apply Fibonacci retracement lines to help identify future support spots. Notice in the chart below that if we plot the Fibos from the $74,400 post-Liberation Day low to the May 22 all-time high, we see that the 38.2% retracement comes into play just below the $98,000 level. I could see that playing out—a bearish breakdown below the June low of $100,000 and change could shake loose the weak hands, setting the stage for a swift move below $100k, and a fast rally thereafter. Another scenario—a more bearish one—takes bitcoin toward its March rebound high in the upper $80,000s. That’s the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the Q2 rally. What might cause that? Well, if we see risk-off price action across asset classes in the weeks ahead, perhaps driven by an escalation in the Middle East geopolitical conflicts between Israel and Iran, or a President Trump ratcheting up tariffs with the July 9 reciprocal tariff relief deadline coming closer into view, then there would probably be selling pressure on IBIT. Another bearish catalyst may simply be deteriorating economic data. The labor market is clearly softening, while the Federal Reserve is hesitant to cut rates—that sets up for a rocky start to the third quarter, potentially. Bitcoin Technicals: Eyeing a $98,000 Downside Target, Equivalent to $55.70 on IBIT StockCharts.com Despite the possible headwinds, we continue to see a steady diet of corporations buying up bitcoin. In late May, GameStop ( GME ) was the latest firm to announce it was adding to its bitcoin reserve. Retail investors also bought the bitcoin dip in April, per EPFR flow of funds data. Corporate Bitcoin Buying Acts as a Possible Floor Seeking Alpha Strong April Bitcoin Inflows, A ""Buy-the-Dip"" Mentality BofA Global Research Furthermore, I remain generally upbeat about the stock market , underpinned by resilient corporate earnings and investor skepticism. That backdrop should support bitcoin as a risk-on asset for now. I would become more bullish on IBIT if it were to probe that $98,000 spot, or upon a breakout above the record high of $112,000. For now, a measured stance is warranted on bitcoin as it keeps on coiling. Looking ahead, prediction markets point to bitcoin perhaps reaching above $130,000 by the end of the year. In the short term, seasonal data points to tailwinds lasting through July. Prediction Markets Point to $136k Bitcoin By Year-End (Max Price) Kalshi Bitcoin Seasonality: Bullish July Trends, Bearish August-September Barchart The Bottom Line I have a hold rating on IBIT. I was bullish on bitcoin toward the end of the first quarter, and after a white-knuckle period around and just after Liberation Day, crypto buying ensued. But with month-long consolidation and softer momentum trends, a wait-and-see approach is justified.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-22 02:49:05

With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round now live, the project is moving beyond the hype cycle and into serious accumulation territory. Lightchain AI brings forward an AI-native blockchain architecture featuring a purpose-built virtual machine and a consensus model that rewards actual computational value. As the July 2025 mainnet launch nears, early movers aren’t chasing memes—they’re looking to Lightchain AI as a platform built for intelligent, long-term utility. Shiba Inu Trends Once More on Meme-Driven Hype Shiba Inu (SHIB) hasn’t led the altcoin rally in the market but has recently gone breakout for the second time owing to meme coin hype and ecosystem related developments. At the time of writing, on May 26, 2025, SHIB is trading around $0.00001454, rising by only 0.02% in the last 24 hours. The rebound is a reflection of the growth in Shibarium, the Shiba Inu Layer 2 blockchain network, and the significant on-chain activities it witnessed, such as the spurt in its registered accounts and transfers. A dramatic rate of SHIB burned — more than 2,200% over the past 24 hours — has lowered the supply for the token, potentially increasing its value. These developments show that the Shiba Inu may be growing beyond its meme roots for sustained relevance in the world of cryptocurrency. Lightchain AI Gains Quiet Strength Among Serious Investors Lightchain AI is gaining quiet strength among serious investors who look beyond short-term hype and focus on long-term infrastructure. The project’s Bonus Round, priced at $0.007, continues to attract steady accumulation due to its sophisticated tokenomics and technical depth.

The complaint alleges the platform acted as an unregistered securities exchange. It also claims that Pump.fun pumped token prices to lure in retail investors. According to the complaint, many users saw their holdings plunge in value after the hype died down. Max Burwick, the firm’s founder, called the platform “a modern pyramid scheme dressed as a viral meme economy.” Trademark Claims Lead To Cease‑And‑Desist Based on reports from February, Burwick Law teamed up with Wolf Popper LLP to issue a cease‑and‑desist order. They argue that several user‑generated memecoins on Pump.fun infringe on trademark rights. That move opened another front of legal risk. Projects tied to big brands or franchises suddenly faced takedown notices. Pump.fun says it’s beefed up its legal team, but it hasn’t shared details on how it plans to settle trademark disputes.

From institutional-grade networks to explosive low-cap projects, these seven picks are backed by analyst consensus, growing demand, and undeniable market momentum. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the most talked-about breakout. And insiders say the real upside is only beginning. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is a decentralized digital asset project built around fixed-supply economics, community-first governance, and transparent architecture. Designed to reward early believers, the token features a locked supply cap of 170 billion, eliminating inflationary risks and setting the foundation for scarcity-driven value growth. Additionally, MAGACOIN FINANCE is 100% community-owned. Every token enters circulation through public-facing mechanisms, ensuring that early adopters retain full control and long-term upside. The protocol has undergone a full smart contract audit by HashEx, boosting investor confidence and validating its secure design. In parallel, an aggressive marketing campaign is preparing to roll out across major crypto media networks, a move analysts say will accelerate visibility, raise demand, and push MAGACOIN FINANCE into mainstream attention. Ripple (XRP) XRP remains in focus as Ripple nears a potential resolution with the SEC. A June joint motion has opened the door for settlement terms that could lift sales restrictions and pave the way for a spot XRP ETF approval. With global partnerships already in place and increasing institutional interest, analysts say XRP’s next breakout depends on regulatory clarity and fund inflows that could exceed $8 billion. Price targets stretch toward $3.87 if bullish momentum returns. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa continues to set itself apart with unmatched network speed and its recent “Crescendo” upgrade. Backed by a growing base of institutional partners and an expanding developer ecosystem, KAS is viewed as a long-term proof-of-work hold. Analysts expect upside continuation into 2026, especially as DeFi integration and zero-knowledge rollups advance. Multiple market researchers are watching for a return to bullish patterns following recent price consolidation. Sui (SUI) Sui is seeing explosive on-chain activity with over $2 billion in DeFi TVL and a rising stablecoin market cap. Recent inflows from institutional funds signal growing confidence despite recent volatility. Sui’s upcoming ETF potential, alongside a robust dApp pipeline, has positioned the token for long-term strength. Analysts are watching for a confirmed breakout above $4.00, which could mark the next leg of expansion. Solana (SOL) Solana remains a cornerstone altcoin for analysts due to its ultra-fast throughput, stablecoin dominance, and deep DeFi/NFT integration. Despite past outages, it continues to lead in speed, scale, and innovation. SOL is expected to stay in rotation among institutional buyers. Momentum remains strong as Solana processes billions in volume and continues expanding into tokenized real-world assets. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum continues to dominate the broader crypto ecosystem. Analysts are monitoring ETH closely ahead of a potential spot ETF approval, which would unlock a massive new wave of capital. With its base-layer dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 ecosystems, ETH remains a strategic long-term hold . Forecasts suggest another major rally is possible if macro and ETF narratives align. PEPE PEPE remains a favorite among speculative altcoin traders. After recent corrections, analysts still believe the token could reach $0.00004 if the meme coin cycle regains strength. Whale movements and high-volume interest show traders haven’t written it off. While risk remains high, its community and liquidity profile keep it on analyst watchlists. Conclusion From blue-chip projects like Ethereum and Solana to rising infrastructure leaders like Kaspa and Sui, the market is packed with long-term opportunities. But analysts agree there is one token in particular that’s gaining momentum faster than the rest. With surging early demand and fully locked tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting bold breakout calls from top analysts.

A Non-Circulating Supply address transferred 4.875 million LINK tokens, worth around $61 million, to Binance. This large transfer marks the first movement from such an address in more than three months and is breaking a long stretch of silence from these addresses. This transfer also appears to be one part of a much larger recent wave of LINK deposits to Binance. In the past 12 hours, LINK deposits to Binance have seen a significant increase. As per on-chain data sources, several addresses identified as Non-Circulating Supply wallets have together deposited approximately $220 million worth of LINK into the exchange. The size and synchronized appearance of these transfers have raised alarms about possible short-term selling of the token. Một địa chỉ thuộc Non-Circulating Supply của Chainlink vừa chuyển 4.875 triệu $LINK lên Binance (trị giá 61 triệu USD) Đây là lần nạp lớn đầu tiên sau 3 tháng im ắng. Đây chỉ là 1 địa chỉ được đánh dấu Non-Circulating Supply trong số nhiều địa chỉ đã… pic.twitter.com/z7kWnzDnBg — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) June 21, 2025 A Surge in Exchange Deposits Sparks Speculation This sudden inflow of LINK tokens onto Binance has attracted the notice of the crypto community. It is an outflow from addresses presumed to hold non-circulating or locked supply. These addresses are thought to be used for team allocations, reserve tokens, and smart contract holdings that are not expected to be part of the circulating econ in the short term. This is the gist of a recent Twitter thread by 0xBoson, an account with a not-so-secret identity that has become a part of the Chainlink community. In this thread, Boer offers context and speculation about why Chainlink is behaving in this manner. These addresses being reactivated—along with the fact that they’re depositing tokens onto a major exchange—has led many analysts to believe a fresh sell-off is afoot. Selling pressure of this magnitude, particularly from such high-volume wallets, usually impacts token prices pretty immediately. And for LINK, this has meant renewed market volatility as traders adjust to the new supply situation. Even if not sold straightaway, simply taking tokens to an exchange often signals holders are switching to a more liquid posture and are ready or getting ready to liquidate. Historical Patterns Offer a Different Perspective It is curious that, despite the initial worry about these large transfers, historical data imply that significant unlocks of LINK and movements to exchanges do not always coincide with declines in price. Lookonchain, for instance, provides data suggesting that several earlier unlock events were followed by substantial price increases. Chainlink Noncirculating Supply wallets deposited 17.875M $LINK ($149M) into #Binance again today. Historically, #Chainlink has done 11 major unlocks—most were followed by price increases. https://t.co/edlAW6psdb pic.twitter.com/3NoK2yhDeo — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 21, 2025 This may be an odd pattern, but it could be the result of some market psychology and some investor expectations. When a large amount gets unlocked, it tends to attract attention and trading volume, and that in turn can lead to some visibility and interest from investors. And after the dust settles post-unlocking, LINK appears to find new support levels and enter recovery phases that can, at times, transition into some nice short-term rallies. Yet, it is necessary to proceed with caution. The timing and magnitude of this event—$220 million in deposits in a very short window—classifies it as something other than just your run-of-the-mill unlock event. If the market sees what is happening with these assets as something beyond just an unfortunate coincidence and interprets it as a sign that long-term holders or internal stakeholders are trying to sell large portions of their holdings, the psychological impact on the market could be significant. Short-Term Pressure, Long-Term Potential Chainlink’s fundamentals are solid, with the project constantly enlarging its part as an essential infrastructure layer for smart contracts, DeFi applications, and the tokenization of real-world assets. Its technology is universally accepted, and its partnerships with both crypto and institutional players keep multiplying. Even so, in the short term, it is supply-and-demand imbalances that typically steer price motions, not the long-term fundamentals of a situation. The sudden factor has introduced over $200 million worth of LINK tokens that are now available for sale on a major exchange. This could create a major market impact in the days or, at most, weeks ahead. At present, traders and long-term holders are keeping a close watch. Some may consider this a potential buying opportunity should prices decline, while others are taking the moment to hedge until the full brunt of the sell-side is absorbed. Like always, big on-chain moves from previously dormant or non-circulating addresses indicate changes in sentiment, strategy, or market structure. It’s not yet clear whether this recent uptick in LINK deposits means we’re headed for a short-term local bottom or a longer-term bearish trend, but what is clear is that the Chainlink token economy has entered a new phase—one marked by higher activity and, seemingly, by higher rates of token inflation. That’s something the market is certainly watching. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

In their latest analysis, they now rate most major altcoins with a 90%-to-95% chance of getting approved as ETFs in the U.S. by 2025, a development that would take institutional adoption of cryptos well beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Even if the precise timing of these approvals is unknown, the SEC’s increased interaction with issuers is a very good sign. It’s very clear that the SEC is working with these issuers very directly, and it’s very likely these products are going to get a green light now. If they do, and they’re Bitcoin ETFs, then that’s clearly a very positive sign for the cryptocurrency ecosystem—just like the altcoin surge. The Next Phase: Altcoin ETFs Could Spark a Full-Fledged Altseason Analysts view the potential for multiple altcoin ETFs as a reason to now reshape expectations across the industry. They believe that the stage is now set for what could be a significant altseason—one not driven solely by retail hype, but also by serious institutional participation. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Several important altcoins, like Litecoin, Solana, and XRP, have already been applied for with the necessary authorities to set up Spot ETFs. Each of these assets now has a very good 95% likelihood—a number that regulators and businesses alike can get behind—of being approved within the next year. Close on their heels are a few other popular cryptocurrencies, like Dogecoin and Cardano, which have a 90% likelihood of following suit in the same time frame. Younger or lesser-known assets like Sui and TRON are said to be at the beginning stages of the ETF filing process. “Most of these approvals are expected to start rolling out from the third to the fourth quarters of 2025, making the second half of that year a potentially transformative period for the crypto market. We could actually see some of these assets potentially double or triple in value if their underlying technology proves out and if the ETF narrative plays out in an unimpeded manner. ” This level of optimism stems from the approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which were officially green-lighted in early 2024. These investment vehicles have helped drive demand for Bitcoin, pushing its price to new highs. Ethereum has followed closely behind in terms of price and has also received ETF approvals. Together, these developments position several other large-cap crypto assets as potential candidates for new ETF products. What Makes ETF Approval So Important? ETFs are an increasingly investor-friendly way to gain exposure to asset classes. Spot ETFs, which track the price of the underlying asset, allow individuals and institutions to invest in crypto assets through regulated financial products. They exist at the intersection of traditional finance and the decentralized world of blockchain. #Altcoin ETFs are coming and the stage is being set for a proper altseason. Multiple altcoins now have active Spot ETF filings and some of them have a 95% approval chance this year. $LTC , $SOL , $XRP have 95% odds of approval in 2025. $DOGE , $ADA , $DOT , $AVAX have 90% odds of… pic.twitter.com/DB3Qh1Z9VU — Ted (@TedPillows) June 21, 2025 Three key benefits come with each ETF approval: 1. Improved transparency: ETFs have simple and straightforward structures that investors can understand. 2. Enhanced market efficiency: ETFs contribute to market efficiency; they cannot be priced inaccurately for any sustained length of time without some form of arbitrage being executed. 3. Broadened access to investment opportunities: Whereas many of the indexes against which ETFs are benchmarked are not tradable themselves, the ETFs that track those indexes are. Inflows from institutions. Huge investors—hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers—almost always prefer to invest in products that are regulated. They can invest directly in crypto assets, but if they want to put in a huge amount of capital, they almost always go with a product like an ETF. Why? Because those products allocate capital to the underlying assets without requiring the institutions to deal with custody of the assets or with the kind of exchanges that are not regulated. New investor accessibility. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make it simpler for ordinary investors to acquire altcoin exposure through traditional brokerage wrappers, IRAs, and 401(k) retirement accounts. This vastly widens the user base for these assets. Legitimacy from regulations. When the SEC or any other regulatory body gives the nod to an asset’s framework, this kind of approval and oversight can only help in winning wider acceptance for the asset itself. Media exposure tends to follow. Such is the kind of long-term, sustainable path that any asset would hope to tread. Spot Bitcoin ETFs clearly drove the dynamics described above. They were expected to bring in large amounts of inflows because they were expected to be very safe and also because they were the first Bitcoin ETFs that could be bought in the U.S. They were meant to track the spot price of Bitcoin. And they did. But also shortly afterward, in mid-2023, they sparked another wave of bullish momentum for Bitcoin itself and also for all other cryptocurrencies. Analysts now think we could see a similar wave of bullish momentum for altcoins if/when their own ETFs get launched. TradFi Turns Its Gaze Toward Altcoins This trend holds a broader implication: that conventional finance is now looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum and is seriously considering a number of other cryptocurrencies as well. Large-cap altcoins, many of which have real-world utility and offer innovative uses of blockchain technology, are now in the sights of not just private wealth managers, but also standard portfolio managers and ETF providers. If the current odds are to be believed, a trio of upcoming exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could pave the way for a profusion of ‘altcoin’ investing—those aren’t Bitcoin or Ethereum—in the financial mainstream. Should these funds see the light of day, 2025 may be remembered as the year of such ‘altcoin’ penetration in price structure. The crypto market is primed for a new potential breakout, but this time it might not be Bitcoin leading the charge. Instead, the diverse and dynamic ecosystem of altcoins—especially the larger ones like Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple—could be the catalyst for the next crypto breakout. Why is this? It’s mostly down to ETF developments. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

All across the board, the network’s underlying strength has been showing like gangbusters lately. With ever-increasing amounts of user activity, institutional-level accumulation, and other altcoin activity, there seems to be a full-blown setup with Ethereum and the entire crypto market for an altcoin rally in the near future. User Activity Surges as Network Growth Accelerates One of the most evident signs of Ethereum’s growing usefulness is the number of fresh addresses that appear every week. Between 800,000 and 1 million new Ethereum addresses are being created every week. Not only is this massive growth in fresh addresses a clear sign that not only are people making Ethereum accounts but also that they are making the accounts in a fashion that could largely be described as sustainable, it appears that Ethereum is doubling up in the old adage that any publicity is good publicity. Whether the new accounts are being used for dApps, DeFi, or merely as a store of value (which is how some people might describe the Bitcoin half of their investment), they’re all good signs. As Ethereum trades right at the $2,500 level, the utility and growth of the network continues looking healthier than ever. The amount of new weekly $ETH addresses created is ranging around 800K-1M per week, compared to about one third less at this point last year. pic.twitter.com/K1nxFBVlqL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 The strong developer community that surrounds Ethereum together with its unshakeable position as the main platform for smart contracts and decentralized finance has converted Ethereum into a real focal point for both individual and institutional users. This is a world in which even the most reliable paths can lead off a cliff, yet here is Ethereum, with always more and more new participators entering its ecosystem. That is just one visible metric, and by all appearances it is a strong one. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence in the Future Big Ethereum owners — often called “whales” — show no signs of slowing down. On-chain data suggests that these high-net-worth individuals are hard at work accumulating ETH, treating it as if tomorrow the supply could run out. This kind of ETH-hoarding behavior from whales usually reflects utter confidence in the future of the asset and often precedes some major price moves. This trend of accumulation not only helps give price support in uncertain times but also sends a small-investor signal that smart money is getting positioned for a possible breakout. The number of Ethereum addresses with large balances keeps growing, and the present market dynamics are so reminiscent of former conditions that came just before previous altcoin bull runs that they have some analysts chattering about an imminent Ethereum bull run. Ethereum whales are stacking $ETH like the supply runs out tomorrow. This is the biggest sign that Altcoin Season is right around the corner! pic.twitter.com/k4h0WVJcgu — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) June 19, 2025 Such trends are frequently early signs pointing to the approach of an “Altcoin Season” — that period in the market when alternative cryptocurrencies are performing tremendously well, often at the same time as Bitcoin is experiencing a substantial upswing. When might that be? Historically, if Ethereum isn’t the leader of the pack (which it often is, given its market cap), it’s at least a very close second, with a sizable difference between the performance of Ether (ETH) and BTC. Institutional Interest Reaches New Highs The most persuasive sign of Ethereum’s solidifying market position is the swelling level of investment from institutions. Not just individuals, but entities of all kinds are now pouring cash into what was once a fringe project. In total, a remarkable 38 institutional entities now hold more than $3 billion in Ethereum. That’s around 1.19 million ETH. And that puts the total ETH held by institutions just shy of 1% of the entire circulating supply. 38 institutions now hold $3 Billion+ in $ETH That’s 1.19M ETH — nearly 1% of all #Ethereum in circulation. Top holders include: 1⃣ Ethereum Foundation 2⃣ Coinbase 3⃣ Golem Foundation 4⃣ PulseChain 5⃣ SharpLink Big money is betting on Ethereum long-term. Are you? pic.twitter.com/9lrpAjXZLK — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) June 20, 2025 Some of the biggest names in crypto are among the top holders of ETH: the Ethereum Foundation, Coinbase, the Golem Foundation, PulseChain, and SharpLink, to name just a few. These entities are not merely buying ETH as a speculative asset and holding large quantities for their own benefit. Many are integrating Ethereum into their operations, development, or infrastructure in some way. Adding legitimacy and a layer of long-term stability to the network is the involvement of institutions in Ethereum. Unlike retail investors, who may enter and exit quickly based on price action, institutions tend to take longer-term positions. They make these moves for reasons more fundamental and strategic than anything driven by the short-term objectives usually found in retail trading. When institutions choose to deploy capital into a network like Ethereum, it definitely sends a positive signal. What is even more positive, however, is that over this past year, Ethereum has not only attracted institutional interest—it has captured substantial institutional capital. Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Ethereum’s price seems to be moving toward an area of stabilization around $2,500. Meanwhile, a number of metrics associated with Ethereum’s blockchain are registering very strong results. And there are unmistakable signs that powerful institutions and high-net-worth individuals are taking a serious interest in Ethereum. If anything, the opposite outcome of a collapse in Ethereum’s price seems very unlikely. And historically speaking, when confidence in Ethereum is running high, it tends to be a leading indicator that a nice little rally in the altcoin space is also coming into view. The crypto market seems to be on the verge of a new growth phase, with a fresh influx of capital and burgeoning network activity. In this situation, not only Ethereum’s status as the premier smart contract platform but also altcoins’ prospects appear to be gaining strength. Both analysts and investors will be keeping a close watch in the weeks to come. If the present trends maintain, Ethereum’s steady grind upward may be just the start of an even bigger move.

It plans to raise $1 billion in an initial presale stage and lists a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4 billion for the token, which has us rather confused. Writing this token up to four bills doesn’t really jibe with how you’d think a platform that just last week was calling itself a “joke” would conduct itself. $1 Billion Raise, Revenue Sharing, and No Vesting: The Token Plan Per sources such as Blockworks and The Block, Pump.fun is ready to launch its own token and has some big plans for it. The company aims to not just raise a substantial amount of money ($1 billion) through public and private sales but also to give its token quite a nice bump in terms of perceived value right out of the gate. That is, right after it lists, the company wants it to have a $4 billion FDV (fully diluted valuation). Pump.fun is already in the process of raising some of that $1 billion. 1/ #pumpfun is launching its own token – $1B presale – $4B FDV – Revenue sharing #crypto model Sounds like the next big #Web3 move – but behind the scenes, controversy is brewing. Here's what you need to know: pic.twitter.com/j8hvPUi254 — Stanislav Lepka (@LepkaStanislav) June 20, 2025 Sources within the company provide insight into the token’s design. They say it’s meant to offer something akin to revenue sharing. That is, if you hold the token, you’re supposed to get a portion of the platform’s profits—more specifically, profits derived from the 1% buyback mechanism that’s tied directly to these alleged revenues. While this setup may appeal to someone looking for a sustainable “real yield”—as opposed to all the like-mentioned DeFi mechanisms that often wind up blowing up in our faces—it comes with two big caveats. At this point, Pump.fun has verified this token distribution. 25% for the public sale 10% for airdrops 65% remains unconfirmed, but is widely expected to be allocated to team members, venture capitalists (VCs), and protocol reserves. Although these numbers seem encouraging on the surface, much of the community is starting to scratch its collective head and ponder what the real motivation behind the launch might have been. Too Late or Too Greedy? The Growing Community Backlash The timing and structure of the token raise, critics say, suggest that this is more about maximizing profit than empowering the community. “They’ve made already hundreds of millions. Why are they asking for another billion?” said one prominent crypto trader on X (formerly Twitter). Another said, “They should have introduced revenue sharing months ago. This feels like a cash grab driven by FOMO.” Since its January 2024 launch, Pump.fun has pulled in revenues of over $742 million as of June 9, 2025. That makes it one of the most profitable platforms in the space—without even having a token. Now, with the promise of revenue sharing finally on the table, many feel the team is dangling carrots after already feasting at the table. Exclusive: The Pumpfun token auction and listing, originally scheduled for June 25, has been postponed again and is now expected to take place in mid-July. Sources familiar with the matter disclosed that since Pumpfun began planning to issue and auction tokens late last year,… pic.twitter.com/UD0xIb45FA — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 20, 2025 Adding to concerns, this isn’t the first time the token’s rollout has been pushed back. Both the auction and the listing, originally slated for June 25, have been put off once more—for now, they’re rescheduled to mid-July. But folks who’ve been watching closely say the auction has actually been on delay since the end of 2024, which has led to the issue being raised that, if this schedule is indeed on the up and up, is the team stretching things out because it’s somehow better for valuation and interest if they do? Mass Adoption or Master Exit? Reading Between the Lines In October 2024, during a Twitter Spaces session, one of the co-founders of Pump.fun laid out some pretty ambitious goals: “We’ve reinvested everything back into the platform. We want to build something like Binance—or bigger. We want to bring this to the masses.” It was a brave assertion—and not of necessity untrue. The platform now counts over 1 million active wallets among its ranks. But underneath that patina, some troubling numbers emerge: only 3.26% of users are currently in the black with their trades, while more than 96% either lose money or make none that’s worth talking about. This really raises the question, with a new token on the way, about ecosystem sustainability. Even as Pump.fun has enjoyed meme coin success, it’s becoming clearer that there’s a growing chasm between the hype and what the potential reality is likely to be. Sure, in a parallel universe, the token that’s been promised could deliver real yield. But extreme risk has been introduced into the equation due to a couple of significant factors. One is the centralized control over the actual token supply. And the other is that vesting, which might serve as a bulwark against extreme risk, just isn’t happening here. Some see the token launch as a long-anticipated opportunity to partake in the platform’s substantial earnings. Others view it as the founding team’s signaling to the masses that they’re getting ready to execute a well-planned, high-profile exit. Conclusion Pump.fun’s token launch promises to be one of the most discussed—and controversial—Web3 events this year. Why? Because it could make a staggering amount of money, and because its presale goal is almost certainly going to ruffle some feathers. That goal? Raise at least $500 million prior to the actual token launch. And guess what? The organizers plan to do this without letting the funds raised during the presale sit in a trust for the token holders. That’s right: No vesting. As the date of the auction in mid-July nears, investors and community members must make a judgment call: is this a sincere attempt to decentralize a platform that prints money like no other, or is it merely the curtain call for what has been a very profitable gig?

The entire wallet activity across the Bitcoin system seems to tell a story of very divergence accumulation behavior between the types of investors. On one side, we have the big institutional investors, who look to be quietly accumulating even more Bitcoin. And on the other side, we have some retail investors—well, a seemingly shrinking group of them—who look to be bailing out of the system once and for all. Whales Accumulate While Retail Flees A recent influx of blockchain data paints an increasingly clear picture of a market dynamic in flux. In the latest 10-day timeframe, the quantity of Bitcoin wallets stacked high enough to hold 10 BTC or more—that is to say, wallets that could accurately be described as “whale” wallets—has gone up by 231. That’s not a huge number, but it’s an uptick. And in the world of crypto, any kind of uptick is something to write home about. Bitcoin's elite vs. mortal wallets are moving in two different directions as its market value sits just north of $104.3K. Wallets with 10+ $BTC : +231 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) Wallets with 0.001 to 10 $BTC : -37,465 Wallets in 10 Days (+0.15%) When large wallets… pic.twitter.com/uhZf6rPYvq — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2025 Retail-level wallets—those containing between 0.001 BTC and 10 BTC—are down a net 37,465 over the same period. This reflects increasing hesitance or submission to the market among the smaller holder demographic, a phenomenon we often associate with fear or uncertainty when the market is not trending positively. This type of divergence has frequently come before bullish market reversals. When the small fish leave while the big fish are busy gathering more and more shares, that can signal a phase of stealth accumulation that soon flips into an uptrend. The current market cycle has large holders accumulating while the small fry exit. Open Interest Points to Potential Volatility Although wallet activity provides some insight into how investors feel about a project, data from the derivatives market adds a whole other dimension to the analysis—especially open interest, the total value of active futures contracts that investors have with one another. As of now, the change in open interest measures -3.5%. This slight figure in the outflow of leveraged positions shows investors still have some faith in the current Bitcoin price level. This is because a number of traders are written off as de-risking or taking profits when we see drawdowns like this happening with the open interest. It could also be seen as traders taking a little Bitcoin off the exchange and putting it back in cold storage. GM. In 2024–2025, deep open interest drawdowns –20–25% were accompanied by local BTC price corrections in the range of 7–21%. Currently, the OI change is –3.5%, which indicates a moderate outflow of positions. In case of a repeated OI decline to levels of –20%, a Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/BcIGZkM0EZ — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 20, 2025 While we’re a long way from those extremes today, analysts are warning that if OI were to renew its plunge to –20% levels, we could be looking at a much sharper BTC correction—likely in the 5–15% range. OI is currently not in crisis, and therefore, we should not be in crisis either. But what is OI? What makes it potentially good or bad? And where, for now, does it reside on the good/bad spectrum? The moderate OI movement suggests that present market players are at best tentatively positioned. It seems that they are quite possibly waiting for a macro signal or an on-chain catalyst that is not forthcoming to drive the next significant market move. A Tale of Two Markets: Sentiment vs Strategy Data is shedding light on a burgeoning disparity between sentiment and strategy in the Bitcoin market. Retail investors seem a bit spooked—possibly swayed by the spell of recent volatility, current macroeconomic uncertainty, or just good old profit-taking after a super strong multi-month rally. The drop-off in activity from small wallets makes our ‘holdco’ in the Bitcoin market look less and less like a coiled spring ready to pop up and more like an average Joe just holding on for dear life. At the same time, institutional-sized investors and whale wallets are steadily increasing their positions. This kind of accumulation usually reveals a long-term, steadfast belief in the value of Bitcoin that goes far beyond the short-term price moves we see all the time. What is seen on the surface is panic, while deeper levels show positioning for the next rally. Market veterans have seen this pattern many times before. The split is not only significant; it is also meaningful. Big investors tend to stock up during the quiet times when main-street investors are absent. They are less concerned with short-term twists and turns—they think of those as “wash trades”—and more about taking a position when they think the price is right. Conclusion As Bitcoin steadies and stays above the price of $104,000, we could be witnessing in real-time what might be playing out a lot farther down the road. The tussle between elite wallets and retail wallets could be a prelude to something much more—if not for price, then for the nature of Bitcoin itself. Elites and retail are in direct conflict when it comes to the accumulation and distribution of Bitcoin. That is a hell of a lot more to be concerned about than price. A significant drop in open interest could mean another bearish episode for Bitcoin. But not all is bad. If we maintain the status quo and whale accumulation continues, once confidence floods back into the market, we could be poised for another leg up. In the Bitcoin universe, the hushed actions of major participants frequently make the most noise. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The intricate scheme, which appears to have drained in excess of $50 million from a range of investors—whales, influencers, and even some venture capitalists among them—has left the crypto community in stunned silence. From Trust to Trap: The Rise and Fall of “Too-Good-To-Be-True” OTC Deals In November 2024, the private Telegram channels and venture capital networks started to circulate over-the-counter deals that were deeply discounted. Investors were offered tokens that everyone wanted, like Aptos and Sei, Graph, Swell, and others. These were not the investment opportunities you tell your friends about at a barbecue, because these tokens were only made available at prices that were 50% below the market rate. And even at those prices, they were announced with the caveat that you should expect these tokens to perform like most things have performed in this market: poorly. It is remarkable how these deals paid off. When the time came for the tokens to be delivered, they found their way into the investors’ wallets, and when they did, something else happened: real returns were seen. And with these real returns came trust. Trust is a big deal in an industry where so much seems to happen behind closed doors. Without trust, people do not put their money in. With trust, it’s like the floodgates open. In late February 2025, the operation ramped up significantly. Larger transactions, involving Tier-1 tokens like NEAR, Axelar, SUI, and Grass, started to pour into our private channels. The deals were still pitched as steeply discounted and safely vested, but now we were talking about real volumes and serious dollar amounts. To a lot of us, it felt like we were on the verge of something big, and that this was going to be the last opportunity we had to pre-sell the pre-sold, institutionally-grade tokens. Ignored Red Flags and the Silent Collapse By May 2025, the warning signs were flashing. On May 25, Eman Abio, a member of the SUI team, posted a public statement on X, urging users to avoid fraudulent OTC offers. Abio stated bluntly: “There is NO deal.” Shortly thereafter, a similar warning was issued by Lucian Mincu, co-founder of Elrond Network (EGLD). Despite the public service announcements, the scams continued with no apparent slowdown, and our Telegram groups remained filled with messages hawking “exclusive” offers. $𝟓𝟎𝐌 𝐂𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐨 𝐎𝐓𝐂 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐦 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝. A massive OTC Scam involving SUI, Near, Axelar, Sei, and more just got exposed but no TG Channel or CT is talking about it. Jaw-dropping details! $GRASS $APT $ZRO $BEAM $IMX $BERA pic.twitter.com/aQS08poZvc — Altcoin Alpha (@AltcoinAlphaOnX) June 20, 2025 The situation developed completely on June 1, 2025. Distributions that were supposed to be sent for earlier deals just stopped. Investors, who were now growing really anxious, were met with half-hearted excuses that were deliberately made to sound like they were reasonable and posed no threat to the company: “The source is traveling (you know how busy and important these people are!),” “There are exchange delays (we’re not really supposed to be telling you all this, but you know how these things go!),” “KYC verification is still pending with the project (as is the case for almost all projects waiting to go live!).” Of course, this only made investors even more suspicious and OTC Fluid was the last offering made on June 1. By mid-June, an alarming trend was unmistakable. On June 19, a stunning admission came from Aza Ventures, one of the most active VC groups pushing these OTC opportunities: they had been scammed. The brain behind the op, known inside the firm as “Source 1,” had apparently been running a Ponzi-style scheme. Earlier deals were paid for by buying tokens on the open market, with money raised from subsequent OTC deals, keeping the whole thing looking legit. This deceptive cycle went on until June when Source 1 entirely stopped delivering tokens. More findings showed that Aza’s other contacts, called “Source 2” and “Source 3,” had also been dealing with the same fraudulent operator. Who Is Source 1—and What Happens Next? Though Aza Ventures claims to know the identity of the man behind the scam, he remains officially unnamed. Insider reports suggest that “Source 1” is an Indian national and the founder of a project listed on Binance. However, Aza has chosen, for now, not to dox him, and instead hopes to use pressure and negotiation to recover investor funds. The fallout has been disastrous. An estimated $50 million has disappeared, with many venture capitalists, crypto whales, influencers, and project team members supposedly losing $1 million or more each. Some retail investors who believed in the scheme and put their life savings into it are now financially ruined and experiencing the worst kind of emotional distress. Reports of mental health crises and suicidal ideation are now surfacing from the once-buzzing-with-hype Telegram groups. At the same time, the now intensifying search for accountability is zeroing in on the potential perpetrators. Victims of the scam are now doing what any good detective would do: they’re tracking wallets, analyzing blockchain activity, and attempting to uncover bogus details about Source 1’s operations and connections. Aza Ventures claims to be working with Convex Finance and the rest of the community to pressure the scammer into refunding a portion of the stolen funds by the end of June—but many in the community are highly skeptical of this claim. Conclusion A large-scale crypto Ponzi scheme has shaken confidence in the RWA and VC-backed sectors of the market and turned a promising wave of OTC opportunities into a busted prospect. A $50 million fraud that was ably perpetrated in trusted Telegram channels and private networks drives home the urgent necessity for verification, transparency, and due diligence—even in seemingly exclusive circles. While awaiting answers and compensation, the many victims of the collapse that FTX wrought must now serve as a painful reminder of the lesson that—”in a space built on decentralization and trustless systems, trust remains the most vulnerable currency of all.” And to be quite blunt, the space we call crypto seems all the more vulnerable today.

CoinGecko’s 2024-2025 RWA Sector Analysis Report highlights in its key findings a surge in capital inflow, market adoption, and product innovation, as decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to bridge the gap with traditional finance (TradFi). Stablecoins Hit Record High as USDT and USDC Cement Market Dominance Stablecoins are still the bedrock of RWA tokenization, with the sector enjoying a most impressive growth spurt. From the very beginning of 2024 through April 2025, the market cap of fiat-backed stablecoins swelled by $97 billion — a 76% uptick — hitting an all-time high of $224.9 billion. This represented a stunning acceleration in the overall stablecoin trad- The space is dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, which together account for 93.5% of the total stablecoin market. Leading the growth was USDT, with an infusion of $56.3 billion, while USDC followed closely behind, adding $37.6 billion to its market cap. Trust at the institutional level and the depth of their liquidity is what really keeps these two in the lead, even as newer challengers try to make their way into the market. Among the newly emerged players, the synthetic dollar from Ethena Labs, USDt, made an audacious entry, racking up a $1.4 billion market cap and vaulting to the fourth-largest stablecoin within just 12 months. The USD0 from Usual Money also cracked the top 10, landing in sixth place with a $600 million market cap. Even with these two impressive debuts, alternative stablecoins such as TUSD, USDB, and USDD—a collection of 10 minor players—held a steady and modest 3.3% market share. Interestingly, stablecoins created by longstanding financial institutions—like PayPal’s PYUSD and Société Générale’s EURCV—have performed below projection. The listless adoption of these supposedly safe instruments can be traced largely to the ongoing regulatory haze, which has yet to clear up. According to CoinGecko's 2024-2025 RWA Sector Analysis Report: https://t.co/cGZqEVOLfn Stablecoin Sector Market Size & Growth: -The market cap of fiat-backed stablecoins surged by +$97B (+76%) from 2024 to April 2025, reaching an all-time high of $224.9B. -USDT and USDC… pic.twitter.com/k41QSncltm — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) June 19, 2025 In their absence, the crypto world is, for now, mostly on its own. Tokenized Treasuries Surge 545% as Economic Fears Drive Demand Tokenized U.S. Treasury securities have become one of the fastest-growing risk-weighted asset verticals, reaching a market capitalization of an all-time high of $5.6 billion in April 2025. This momentous surge we pegged at a whopping 544.8% from early 2024, further reaffirming our faith in the rising institutional demand for yield-bearing, low-risk assets on the blockchain. In March and April of 2025, growth rapidly accelerated. There was a sharp inflow of capital precision in the box since March 2025, where things started to pick up, and by April, there was 2.3 billion more entering the market — government tokenized debt, really, but still a pretty substantial sum, I think most would agree. The trigger for this was an uptick in global economic uncertainty. At the forefront is the BUIDL fund from BlackRock and Securitize, launched in July 2024. By April 2025, BUIDL had astonishingly captured 45% of the tokenized treasury market, growing 372.8% in under a year. The fund’s success demonstrates how asset managers are using blockchain technology to make fixed-income investments more transparent and accessible. Ethereum is still the dominant force among the networks backing these assets. Yet, the tech remains in its infancy, with just over 11,000 holders counted on the global scale. That puts these onchain assets firmly in the category of a niche play. “Tokenized treasuries are still considered a niche play among crypto-native users,” said Kevin Kelly, co-founder and head of research at Delphi Digital. Onchain Private Credit Rebounds Slowly, Maple Finance Takes the Lead Despite the rapid rise of stablecoins and tokenized treasury products, private on-chain credit continues to wallow in mediocrity. Through April 2025, the total active loan volume of the sector stands at $546.8 million, approximately one-third of the peak it hit in May 2022. The sharp downward trajectory was felt most acutely in Q3 2024 when Centrifuge, a major on-chain credit player, pivoted its focus to the up-and-coming tokenized treasuries market. Even with the current downturn, Maple Finance is untouched and remains a resilient leader amongst DeFi protocols. The Maple protocol is responsible for a whopping $374 million in active loans, which constitutes 67% of the top six private credit platforms. … Meanwhile, it is steadily marching into the RWA (real-world asset) ecosystem alongside other DeFi protocols. Even though growth in these lending platforms remains slow when compared to other onchain lending verticals, mixed in with a credit market experiencing a renaissance—from the leniency of federal regulators, underwriting innovation, and Dapper Labs’ new $35 million lending fund—these developments could very well serve as the fuel needed for a new lending bull market. Conclusion The DeFi sector is changing quickly, and our friends at CoinGecko have released a report to help readers make sense of the developments. The picture those developments paint isn’t necessarily a comforting one, however. Here are some of the key points from CoinGecko’s RWA Sector Analysis 2024–2025. The DeFi landscape is rapidly evolving, with the center of gravity moving toward stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. The mainstream constructs of truly decentralized finance remain largely as yet unrealized. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the way monetary policy is now being conducted, and in no uncertain terms told his followers on Truth Social that Powell is a “disaster” and that “inflation is going to kill our economy”—and that he’s disappointed they’re now holding rates steady and not cutting them like he apparently thinks they should. What are the potential impacts of all this on not just the stock market but also cryptocurrencies and the wider economy? At the center of the controversy is the well-known clash of interests: Trump’s aggressive preference for rate cuts to juice the economy versus Powell’s umpteenth reiteration of the Fed’s dual mandate—ensure stable prices and maximum employment. With the electoral drama of 2024 out of the way, we’re likely to be in a more volatile 2025 financial landscape. The priorities of elected officials and those of the independent central bank will likely be more at odds than ever—and likely a much bigger story than Trump still being very much in the picture.

As of now, Bitcoin trades at a distance of 6.8% from its all-time high of $64,000 reached on May 22, 2021. Similarly, the S&P 500 stands at a 2.6% deficit from its record peak of $3,386 reached on February 19, 2021. These figures represent a modest downward correction for both assets, but they shine a light on the current state of investor confidence in both the Fed’s next move and the broader macroeconomic recovery.

Some traders and analysts see the potential for rate cuts as a bullish catalyst across the board. But rate cuts could be an even better catalyst for crypto, given that the market’s tendency to respond sharply to shifts in monetary policy. Trump sees a link between his popularity and the Fed’s interest rate policies. When consumers and businesses are confident, the economy hums along. When that happens, the president tends to look good, at least if he’s up for re-election the next year. But Powell has so far resisted this pressure, maintaining that any future rate moves will be guided by economic data—particularly inflation indicators—rather than political will. This confrontation lays the groundwork for a strained standoff between the president and the Fed, with ripple effects almost sure to be felt in global markets. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings See Massive Growth Though rate policy usually gets the most attention, a much quieter but equally significant transformation is taking place within the crypto universe. The number of publicly traded firms that now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets has tripled, from 10 to 30, over the last year. Why are so many more companies now jumping into the deep end of crypto, and what does it mean for the future? More favorable regulation in the U.S. has set the stage for greater corporate adoption of crypto. Moves in Congress lately have clarified how crypto is taxed, set up some investor protections, and basically streamlined the regulatory environment for crypto, which makes it a whole lot easier for companies to hold and manage Bitcoin. Next, rising geopolitical instability—from trade confrontations to shooting wars—has renewed enthusiasm for Bitcoin as a bulwark against uncertainty. Increasingly, many companies view BTC not just as a bet-it-all-in Vegas kind of play but instead as something more analogous to a strategic reserve that also happens to be digital gold. In times of market turbulence or currency convulsions, Bitcoin’s decentralization and global appeal have never looked more attractive to company treasurers looking for more ways to diversify. Significantly, well-known companies in various fields—including technology, energy, and finance—have jumped onto the Bitcoin bandwagon, which suggests that the cryptocurrency’s standing in the corporate world is improving. No longer considered a fringe experiment, Bitcoin is now part of the fundamental corporate strategy in many high-profile companies. Policy Uncertainty Fuels Crypto Sentiment The Trump administration and the Federal Reserve are creating a crypto narrative. We have a possible short-term upside event for not just Bitcoin but for all digital assets, which is that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates. Lowering rates would be bad for the dollar. But it might not even be that bad for the dollar, because it would be lowering the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t pay interest, like Bitcoin. So it’s possible that if the Fed cuts rates, and in the context of broader questions about the federal government’s fiscal policy, we could see the dollar weaken, and that is going to be good for all these assets. Powell and Trump’s stimulus vision in a push-pull market. Powell insists on making data-driven decisions. Trump, on the other hand, pushes for a very proactive kind of stimulus. You have market actors trying to make sense of this and price it in. And they’re having a hell of a time doing it. Why? Because what we’re talking about here is the inner dynamics of inflation. At the same time, the increasingly broad institutional acceptance of Bitcoin provides another fresh layer of support for the cryptocurrency market. That could help soften any downward momentum that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might have during poor macroeconomic conditions. And it reinforces the notion that those cryptocurrencies could indeed be viable long-term investments. Once we reach the midpoint of 2025, the Fed’s next move will be the focus of attention, what with a presidential election having just taken place. And right now, we can only guess how the political-economic tug-of-war that is shaping the U.S. Congress might affect the future of both traditional markets and digital assets.

46518006,https://nulltx.com/?p=150486,1750562527,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,BNB Chain Weathers Turbulent Week Amid Altcoin Meltdown,https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-weathers-turbulent-week-amid-altcoin-meltdown/,"The BNB Chain ecosystem has endured a stormy week, shedding $12.4 billion in market capitalization amid a broader altcoin crash that rippled across the digital asset space. While flagship assets such as Bitcoin slipped below the $104,000 mark, the BNB Chain’s performance mirrored the market downturn with a 7% drop in value. BNB itself fell 4.5%, closing the week just under $640. On-chain diagnosis of the state of affairs was not encouraging. Total value locked (TVL) in the BNB Chain ecosystem took a 5% hit. The major DeFi platforms—which include Venus and PancakeSwap—suffered big losses. The situation was not helped by falling trading volumes on DeFi exchanges and across the board; stablecoin transactions, which had been a bright spot, also declined. Overall, there has been a notable drop in engagement on-chain and in movement of capital across the BNB Chain. It is interesting to note that the daily active addresses on BNB Chain increased by 5%. This percentage increase suggests that despite the selloff, and reduced trading activity, users of BNB Chain are continuing to interact with applications on that network. In fact, this uptick in user activity, even with the market heading downward, says a lot about BNB Chain—and not just in terms of its solvency. Tokens Tumble, But Some Defy Gravity The week saw severe losses for most BEP-20 tokens on the BNB Chain. Among them, KOGE took one of the sharpest falls, plummeting down to 51.1%. ROAM wasn’t too far behind, with a decline of 40.4%; MYTH, with 38.2% down, closely followed. These altcoin losses are a function of the segment’s overall volatility and risk sensitivity. Investors seem to be pulling capital from the smaller, emerging tokens that for them provide little cover in the face of a dip like this. Altcoins can be more easily and dramatically affected by market movement because they are either illiquid or insufficiently capitalized. Altcoins are also the tokens most likely to get the rug pulled on them. A handful of tokens managed to log some gains, even with the market feeling negative. AB surged 31.5% because of something we don’t usually get a chance to talk about, the kind of increased visibility that comes with being featured on Binance Alpha. ALT logged a nice 23.9% bump, thanks to its new role in the BNB Kickstart program, which aims to help serve and shine a light on new projects in the crypto space that really seem to have something special going on. ORBS was another token that took the opportunity of this clearly defined market to power up a 15.5% gain. And standing out was clearly the way to go, as that was the only way to be noticed in a mostly negative space. These tokens’ performance demonstrates that, although the broader market was facing difficulty, some projects were still managing to preserve or even enhance their value. The kinds of projects that thrived in this context seemed to have either institutional or programmatic backing. Week in BNB Chain: Sector Weakens During Altcoin Market Meltdown. BNB Chain sheds $12.4B! BTC drops Let’s break down how BNB Chain weathered the storm 1/6 pic.twitter.com/9Tjmn0azSj — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 19, 2025 Ecosystem Developments Point to Long-Term Growth In the middle of market ups and downs, the BNB Chain kept its eyes on the prize: the expansion and betterment of its ecosystem. Last week, the BNB Chain Incentive Fund, worth $100 million, made 17 fresh token buys, still on that same mission to help pay for the sort of innovation that will, ideally, also pay off in the sort of growth that we hope accompanies the kinds of not-so-promising projects we find on some networks. One significant change occurred when the complete migration of KOM from Polygon and Arbitrum to the BNB Chain was realized. This represented not just an appeasement of KOM to a new ecosystem, but a corroboration from developers of the BNB Chain’s infrastructure, scalability, and support systems. It could be that projects migrating are finding new advantages in the environments they are moving to. Then again, it could be that BNB Chain is simply the next place to be for projects looking to establish a strong community. Migration seems to be the word of the day. At the same time, MCPForge experienced an enhancement in its designation within the BNB Hack program, which underscores the ecosystem’s excitement about rewarding and recognizing technical brilliance. Also, SwissBorg implemented BNB Chain into its cross-chain functionality, allowing smooth token swapping between various blockchain networks and further interpolating BNB Chain into the global crypto scene. These initiatives in the ecosystem signal to us that BNB Chain is not standing idle in the current climate of market pressure. It is purposeful. It is investing. And not just in what it already has. It is expanding its very nascent infrastructure (it must be real if it’s called the ‘infrastructure fund’), growing the developer ecosystem with the recent hackathon, and also—this is key—we mustn’t skip over—it is deepening and widening its cross-chain work nowadays. Looking Ahead Even with BNB Chain losing billions in value alongside the broader altcoin market, the network sees very encouraging user activity as well as strategic and smart growth around its ecosystem that makes it look like it has some underlying strength. And you know, I think it’d be good to put a bit of context around BNB Chain here too, since it is a bit of a tricky case for certain folks. So, first, the user base: it puts BNB Chain at almost over 200 million users across its ecosystem. While the crypto markets keep moving up and down, the long-term strength of chains such as BNB may depend on how well they can keep user engagement and draw in novel projects. BNB Chain showed signs this past week that it might be doing a good job on both fronts. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a lawsuit filed by Burwick Law, Burwick accuses Pump Fun of profiting millions of dollars through what they describe as ‘unregistered volatile securities.’ Baton and Pump Fun’s CEO Jared L. Williams called the charges nonsense in a press release. Baton’s defense team is nothing short of amazing. Leading the team is Daniel L. Sachs, a former SEC investigator known for his aggressive defense strategies in high-profile financial cases. He is joined by Kyle P. Dorso, a crypto litigation expert with a deep background in token classification law, as well as Stephen D. Palley, a veteran attorney who has long worked at the intersection of blockchain innovation and U.S. regulatory law. Thread: https://t.co/BGLlmEreUW – the FUD-triggered rebound @pumpdotfun 1/ Everyone thought #pumpfun was finished after last day ´s Twitter scare—that platform is dead, volume collapsing, interest gone… FUD was everywhere. pic.twitter.com/KBoj4k1cmy — Stanislav Lepka (@LepkaStanislav) June 19, 2025 The lawsuit is now ongoing, and Pump Fun’s lawyer has filed a motion to dismiss. Meanwhile, the platform is still under intense scrutiny from regulators, skeptics, and the crypto community at large. Critics have taken a position of already predicted doom for the platform, especially after a wave of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) spread like wildfire on X (formerly Twitter), accusing the platform of being run in a shady manner and prompting panic among retail traders. Despite the Panic, the Platform Persists Even as the sensationalist headlines shrieked disaster and social media sentiment sunk to an all-time negative low, the on-chain data told a different story—and one that was far more surprising. Per analytics platform Dune, the trading volume for Pump Fun held strong throughout the drama, and, in fact, surged in the days following the Twitter scare. Pump Fun's parent company, Baton Corporation, has hired top lawyers from Brown Rudnick to fight the lawsuit filed by Burwick Law. The defense team includes former SEC investigator Daniel L. Sachs, crypto litigation expert Kyle P. Dorso, and veteran attorney Stephen D. Palley.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 19, 2025 In the past week, daily trading activity has seen meme token trades range between 2 to 2.7 million per day on the platform. The equivalent in USD varied between $120 million and $184 million—numbers that go against the narrative that the platform is dying. What accounts for this surge in volume? Not the FUD, since that just got the community rallying behind the platform yet again. It appears to be a recurring theme in the volatile world of memecoins that negative publicity serves as rocket fuel for the platforms. Instead of pulling away, users seemed to lean in more. The new traders entered the fray, and the existing ones doubled down, viewing the backlash as a potential buying opportunity. FUD as Fuel: Why the Memecoin Crowd Didn’t Flinch The memecoin ecosystem has a psychological aspect that traditional finance has not understood very well. It’s not just about utility or market fundamentals—it’s also about what is called, for lack of a better term, hype. And memecoins are really good at generating hype, partly because of the ecosystems that have grown up around them. You can now, for instance, join a Discord server for a specific memecoin. The sentiment that seems to prevail among traders is: “FUD = fuel.” Many speculators took the dip in sentiment and price as a classic opportunity to “buy the blood.” As the legal drama continued to play out in the headlines, users once again piled back onto the platform, proving that narrative doesn’t always match up with reality. After all, drama is what makes trading in memecoins so attractive. Traditional investors run away from the kind of price volatility that meme traders actually love. They understand that investing in such coins is a bet on the kind of attention that always seems to find the next big thing. To this community, all these legal problems are just one more part of the ongoing story. The Bigger Picture: Data Over Drama Pump Fun teaches us a lesson that reaches far beyond the realm of crypto speculation: our emotions can throw us off, but the data is usually accurate and dependable. The legal troubles could become something serious and very important, but the immediate existence and persistence of the platform in question is based on real, and to my way of thinking, pretty impressive, measurable activities on-chain. At its core, this dispute highlights a basic reality of contemporary financial markets—particularly crypto: what gets counted counts. The metrics that people talk about, especially in private conversations, are the things that drive momentum. It remains to be seen whether Pump Fun can weather the upcoming legal storm. But if recent performance is any indicator, this is a platform—and a community—not ready to go quietly into the crypto graveyard. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This moment highlights the contrast with only two years ago when the landscape was not nearly as inviting for this particular sector of the cryptocurrency space. The transformation’s essence is a heightened demand for yield-bearing stablecoins, a broadened issuer base, and a tighter integration with both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) systems across the many different blockchain networks. The transformation’s essence is a heightened demand for yield-bearing stablecoins, a broadened issuer base, and a tighter integration with both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) systems across the many different blockchain networks. The market is evolutionarily moving beyond its reliance on just a few key players and the dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins, hinting at a more vibrant future. 2/ Stablecoin supply on Base has held steady, while Arbitrum is showing early signs of a rebound. $USDC and $USDT continue to dominate on both chains. pic.twitter.com/dCHY11Vwtv — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) June 19, 2025 Yield-Bearing Stablecoins and Issuer Diversity on the Rise 2025 shows a trend that’s beyond any doubt: the burgeoning emergence of yield-bearing stablecoins. One of the most interesting newcomers is Ethena, which in a very short span of time has managed to garner an impressive supply figure of almost $6 billion since its launch. And that supply figure is obviously no indication of slowing demand; if anything, it’s quite the opposite. Stablecoin supply has passed $250 billion for the first time. • Yield-bearing stablecoins are growing fast. Ethena has grown to nearly $6 billion since launch. • Tether and Circle still dominate, holding a combined 86% of outstanding supply. • Issuer diversity is increasing.… pic.twitter.com/mrokz8u4OL — Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) June 18, 2025 Even with these new entrants, the traditional issuers still have a chokehold on the overall market. Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) have a combined 86% of the total stablecoin market. Still, there are now at least ten stablecoins with over $100 million in circulation, meaning there is a far wider choice of issuers, a greatly reduced risk of stablecoin monopoly, and a much more competitive stablecoin hat market. Now, perhaps the single most significant aspect for us to consider is that over $120 billion in U.S. Treasuries are now locked inside stablecoins. This reflects the role of stablecoins as a liquidity sink that operates mostly outside the traditional financial markets—affording us some new opportunities and some new systemic considerations. Chain-Specific Trends: Arbitrum and Base Take Diverging Paths Stablecoin distribution and usage across Layer 2 chains is changing. Base, Coinbase’s L2, has stablecoin supply levels that are consistently stable. Arbitrum, however, is starting to come back after a to-the-top stall. Both ecosystems are reliant on USDC and Tether (USDT), which is where the stablechain activity appears to be. Nevertheless, if one were to take a more nuanced glance, they would see that differing dynamics are at play. On Arbitrum, significant growth has been achieved over the past three months by stablecoins like BUIDL and USDC, even while the supply of USDT has dropped dramatically. Base, by comparison, is not seeing the same kind of pronounced growth in non-USD paired stablecoins. Thus, on the surface, one might be tempted to view Arbitrum as the more accomplished protocol. However, it’s quite the opposite. Discrepancies also arise in the holding patterns of stablecoins. On Base, a large portion is parked within centralized exchanges — especially Coinbase — suggesting a more custodial-heavy user base. Arbitrum, on the other hand, holds a more decentralized profile, with most stablecoins flowing into DeFi. @HyperliquidX is Arbitrum’s largest holder, representing the most decentralized part of the ecosystem and a key driver of liquidity. Yet Base seems to be a far more stable environment. DeFi Powerhouses and Changing Lending Patterns As stablecoins continue to embed themselves in DeFi, key players are reshaping how value flows across networks. On Arbitrum, HyperliquidX stays the course, powering a wide range of DeFi activity and driving steady transfer volumes throughout 2024 and into 2025 — primarily via USDC and USDT. On Base, a rising star is Morpho Labs. It is leading the growth of stablecoins in DeFi lending. Use of the lending platform has surged, while Arbitrum’s main traditional lending protocol, AAVE, has seen its use sharply decline over the past month. Divergence also emerges when it comes to the fiat they transact with. Almost all of Arbitrum’s on-chain activity is USD-denominated. Base doesn’t have a huge amount of on-chain activity yet, but a substantial portion of what is happening seems to be in Euron, thanks to EURC, a token that is essentially an ERC-20 Euro. The same holds for the centralized exchanges. Arbitrum and Base are both sending substantial amounts of stablecoins to Binance. This is no small thing, and it indicates that the on-chain activity of both these networks is linked in a significant way to the trading that happens on these centralized exchanges. Conclusion: A More Complex, Liquid, and Multi-Faceted Market The 2025 stablecoin market is a creature very different from the simple structures of 2022. Its supply has crossed the $250 billion threshold, its issuers have diversified like never before, and products that were unimaginable just a few years ago—like yield-bearing stablecoins—are now part of the game. All of this makes the market ripe for disruption. Concurrently, usage pattern disparities at the network level—between Base’s centralized assets and its engagement with the USD, and Arbitrum’s DeFi-first, dollar-centric approach—illuminate the fact that this space is no longer a one-size-fits-all market. As stablecoins continue to reconfigure—and, in some cases, liquefy—Web3’s financial architecture, the industry appears to be entering its most mature, multifaceted, and inflation-safeguarded phase yet.

Institutional activity, whale accumulation, and infrastructure upgrades are aligning for what analysts call “one of the most critical pre-bull setups of 2025.” As these major names prepare for breakout moves, early investors are racing to position themselves before price momentum accelerates. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the most watched altcoins of 2025. Investor demand has soared, with crypto insiders already moving in on what some analysts say “may outperform every token this cycle.” Whale Activity and ETF Confidence Boost Ethereum’s Outlook Ethereum has reclaimed critical support above $2,500 and remains one of the top assets for institutional exposure. With exchange reserves now at historic lows, analysts see ETH’s scarcity as a bullish catalyst heading into Q3. Spot ETF inflows recently posted their strongest weekly showing in months. These sustained inflows are a key signal of investor confidence, pushing Ethereum toward a potential breakout zone near $2,850. Staking activity is also rising, despite the drop in base yield. Ethereum’s infrastructure remains a pillar of the DeFi economy, with nearly half of all stablecoins operating on its network. Analysts tracking ETH’s chart patterns believe it is gearing up for a multi-week move that could redefine its trajectory before year-end. Dogecoin Returns to Strength With Whale Demand Surging Dogecoin is surprising many market watchers with a sharp rebound in the face of global market uncertainty. After breaking above key resistance at $0.177, DOGE has held its ground and even climbed, signaling renewed conviction among large buyers. Whales accumulated over 1.4 billion DOGE across April and May, worth more than $300 million, while transaction volumes crossed $1.2 billion. Analysts note that DOGE is entering a critical setup. A breakout above $0.26 could pave the way for a push to $0.30 and beyond. Historical patterns suggest the potential for a parabolic rise if momentum continues to build. Murmurs of a possible Dogecoin ETF and Elon Musk’s continued blockchain integrations are keeping this token squarely in the spotlight. SEI Shows Aggressive Growth in DeFi and Wallet Adoption SEI is gaining traction fast, with price action now trending between $3.10 and $3.90. Analysts highlight SEI’s consistently higher lows, strong resistance at $3.30, and a clean breakout structure. What’s driving the excitement? Surging stablecoin adoption, SuiLend’s 90% TVL growth, and expanding DeFi liquidity. SEI now ranks among the top non-EVM chains by value locked and has seen major integrations, including Real Vision’s blockchain rewards. Fund inflows reached over $9 million last week, with traders anticipating a run toward $4.50 if current momentum holds. High-volume accumulation and ecosystem resilience—despite recent exploit recoveries—are supporting SEI’s climb as a mid-cap contender for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum in the Crypto Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE is the altcoin many analysts believe will outperform the entire market cycle. The token’s supply has been permanently locked at 170 billion, eliminating inflation risk and fueling scarcity. It’s 100% community-owned with no VC control, and the smart contract has been fully audited by HashEx, an important layer of trust for today’s investors. As listings approach, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the most anticipated token of the year. Aggressive marketing campaigns are about to go live, targeting global reach through digital ads, media placements, and investor syndication. This visibility surge is expected to trigger a wave of demand. Analyst forecasts are already calling it “a potential 2025 breakout altcoin”—one that’s attracting attention from large buyers before the wider market catches on. Final Thought As Ethereum, Dogecoin, and SEI all seem close to making decisions, various investors will be focused on confirming breakouts soon using the charts. Each asset shows strength in different segments—ETH in institutional flows, DOGE in retail engagement and whale interest, and SEI in infrastructure and DeFi adoption. While these majors attract headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to build massive momentum behind the scenes , with smart money eyeing its fixed supply, audited contract, and aggressive positioning. As visibility ramps up, this token is shaping up to be one of the biggest crypto stories of 2025.

This unprecedented step follows a massive $100 million cyberattack on the platform that many are now calling one of the most devastating digital assaults anywhere in the country’s financial history. This week, a directive was announced that is now restricting crypto exchanges in Iran to operating between the hours of 10 AM and 8 PM. The move is said to be intended to improve oversight and security, limiting the risk of further attacks during less-staffed nighttime hours when teams are offline and more vulnerable to breaches. Iran's central bank has ordered local crypto exchanges to operate only between 10 AM and 8 PM to tighten oversight and reduce risks of incidents like the Nobitex hack during off-hours. https://t.co/kiLff8sXud https://t.co/aySfH2OTnr — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 19, 2025 A Coordinated Digital Strike The breach at Nobitex occurred on June 18. It was breached by a cybercriminal group known as Predatory Sparrow. They are not believed to be very far removed from the state of Israel. The attack has drawn a lot of attention and serious concern around the world—especially among cryptocurrency holders—because of the nearly $90 million worth of cryptocurrency that the group destroyed, in what is probably one of the most creative and novel ways to destroy such a large amount of digital assets seen to date. Update on the cyberattack against Iran’s largest crypto exchange Nobitex: On June 18, Israeli-linked hacker group Predatory Sparrow claimed responsibility for the attack. Key developments: Full source code of Nobitex leaked ~$90M in crypto assets destroyed, sent to a… https://t.co/wxM94Ydnfu — Followin (@followin_io) June 19, 2025 The hackers not only wrought financial havoc but also divulged the entire source code for the Nobitex platform, which is compounded by this being the second recent attack on an Iranian crypto exchange. Messages sent out with the attack make it clear that there are political motivations at play here, beyond just trying to grab some cash. Which also makes sense, given how closely tied this whole incident is starting to look with past cyber operations undertaken by the IRGC that have targeted Iranian state-backed industry. Nobitex, which controls almost 90% of Iran’s domestic crypto market, first asserted that the massive outflow of digital assets was a result of a “preemptive technical operation” by its internal team, carried out in an attempt to mitigate further risk. Later, the company confirmed that approximately $100 million in digital assets had been destroyed in what it called a “psychological attack”—an operation designed to undermine public trust and national morale. Iran Enforces Crypto Curfew In response to a major breach at Nobitex, Iran’s largest crypto exchange, the Central Bank of Iran has imposed nighttime restrictions on all crypto trading platforms operating in the country. Nobitex, which commands nearly 90% of the domestic crypto… pic.twitter.com/aC1HS5iQHH — Nomy (@NomyFinance) June 19, 2025 Government and Industry Response In the hours after the attack, Iranian leaders wasted little time in putting measures into place. The country’s Central Bank, for instance, recently issued a new curfew regulation aimed at cutting back on trading activity that happens during the nighttime hours. That’s when, the thinking apparently goes, cyber threats can be at their most effective since nobody’s around to notice them. It’s also when banks and other institutions might not be doing enough to monitor the situation and respond to any problems that crop up. The Central Bank stressed that this is a stopgap measure as inquiries proceed, but did not discount the possibility of introducing more restrictions or making a definitive change in the regulation of crypto in the future. Despite this, the trading of cryptocurrencies is very much alive in Iran, due to the country’s ongoing economic sanctions and the devaluation of its currency. The Nobitex episode has, however, reignited an argument over the safety and legality of decentralized finance in Iran. Nobitex has, for its part, attempted to reassure its users. The company has stated that all customer funds are completely backed by its reserve fund and emphasized that no user balances have been compromised. In a statement that was released shortly after the breach, the exchange confirmed that it is working with local cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to trace the attack and recover any salvageable data. Gradual Recovery Ahead Even though the incident was serious, access to the Nobitex platform will gradually come back over the next four to five days, the company said. They plan to add a few more security layers before completely returning to normal, like stricter withdrawal limits, enhanced multi-group authentication, and new real-time threat monitoring systems. Experts in the field caution that the repercussions of the Nobitex breach could wash over the region and affect other nations in it, as those countries reassess their own cybersecurity systems. For now, Iranians who use Nobitex will have to work with the trading schedule that the service provider now observes. And they will have to get used to a changed world, one in which the digital finance realm, so recently praised for its ability to provide a stabilizing effect in an economy as shaky as Iran’s, is now firmly in the sights of regulators. The struggle for innovation and security will become increasingly complex for the Iranian authorities and the Iranian crypto industry as the investigation unfolds and more facts come to light. They will now have to cope with the higher level of digital warfare that these institutions are engaging in and manage the economic uncertainty that appears to be an unavoidable part of the deal.

The tokens below aren’t just cheap—they’re fundamentally strong, actively developing, and gaining traction where it matters. Let’s break down seven projects with serious upside before year’s end. 1. Cardano (ADA): DeFi Expansion Could Spark Rebound Cardano may be down recently, but it’s far from out. After falling over 13% in June and testing key support at $0.60, ADA is still backed by a vibrant community and impressive on-chain stats—5.4 million+ wallets and $356M locked in DeFi. Founder Charles Hoskinson’s plan to convert $100 million in ADA into Bitcoin and stablecoins could supercharge its DeFi ecosystem and restore momentum. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gaining Ground MAGACOIN FINANCE has lit up presale circles this year. With a fixed 170B token supply, HashEx-audited code, and no VC control, it’s structured for long-term sustainability. Analysts predict anywhere from 35x to 100x ROI, especially with staking rewards launching soon and a major marketing push on deck. Some even see $1 as a moonshot possibility. 3. Toncoin (TON): Quietly Building Momentum Thanks to Telegram integration, Toncoin is building utility fast. Its $3.00+ breakout reflects rising demand, while $155M+ in DeFi TVL and growing dev activity round out its bullish case. Ton is showing a symmetrical triangle pattern, which hints at a potential breakout to $4.50s. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE): Don’t Count It Out Dogecoin may not always be taken seriously, but the numbers tell a different story. Even with the ups and downs, Dogecoin has stayed solid. Big holders are buying more, and there’s still plenty of real usage on the network every day. On top of that, Dogecoin’s growing role in Base-layer DeFi and renewed ETF speculation are giving it fresh fuel. A break past $0.65 wouldn’t be surprising if this trend continues. 5. Stellar (XLM): Quiet Climb With Heavyweight Backing Stellar isn’t making daily headlines, but it’s getting a serious boost from big-name partners like PayPal and Mastercard. The network is hitting new highs in stablecoin use and saw a huge 282% spike in monthly users. It’s not flashy—but it’s moving, and fast. If it lands in a NASDAQ crypto index as rumored, XLM could quickly reprice. 6. Algorand (ALGO): Fundamentals Say Yes ALGO isn’t flashy right now, but it’s building steadily. Mastercard, Nubank, and tokenized U.S. bonds are now part of its ecosystem, and staking is live with over 2B tokens committed. Oversold on the charts, ALGO looks poised for a catch-up rally. 7. Tron (TRX): Public Listing Sparks New Attention TRX just announced a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment—potentially making Tron the first major crypto network to go public in the U.S. The result? A 40% price bounce and renewed momentum. With $100M in TRX being acquired for treasury use and over 75B USDT circulating on its chain, Tron’s role in stablecoins and global payments is hard to ignore. Final Thoughts Each of these tokens offers more than a low price tag. They bring real development, user growth, and future-facing roadmaps to the table. Whether you’re drawn to established ecosystems like Cardano or Stellar, or disruptive newcomers like MAGACOIN, you are set for 2025. Analysts are confident the next gem is a token trading under $1.

Between explosive ETF speculation, high-stakes staking shifts, and aggressive technical upgrades, both networks are racing to maintain dominance. Yet even with billions in institutional capital circling, crypto insiders are already pivoting their attention elsewhere. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rapidly ascending force that analysts say is shaping up to be 2025’s most disruptive altcoin story. With a model built around transparency and a scarcity-backed supply structure, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong ground as the token to watch, while established names manage mounting pressure. Solana’s Speed, Upgrades, and Institutional Aggression Solana is moving fast — both on the charts and under the hood. While price volatility tested investor sentiment early this month, SOL has stabilized in a tighter range, posting a 25% gain over 30 days. Analysts now point to support at $162 and resistance near $180, suggesting a potential breakout is forming. But price is just one piece of Solana’s evolution. The blockchain is undergoing a major protocol shift with its Alpenglow Upgrade, replacing its Proof-of-History consensus with the new Votor and Rotor layers. This change is set to slash transaction finality to just 150 milliseconds — a milestone that positions Solana at the frontier of decentralized speed. Infrastructure innovation doesn’t stop there. The Firedancer Validator Client, engineered by Jump Crypto, is on the horizon and expected to overhaul the network’s reliability and decentralization. This could push Solana out of its “beta” label and into a new tier of Layer-1 trust. Meanwhile, institutional participation is surging. Galaxy Digital has reportedly added over $63 million in staked SOL, while ETF momentum is at an all-time high. Eight-spot Solana ETF applications are in play, with analysts projecting a 90% approval chance — a signal that the big money is locking in. Ethereum: ETF Records and On-Chain Strength Ethereum is no stranger to dominance, and June 2025 is no exception. ETH has surged past $2,570, flashing bullish technicals like a golden cross and bullish flag pattern. A recent 7% surge over 24 hours came on trading volume north of 819,000 ETH — a clear sign that bulls are charging. Ethereum price chart. Source. Coingecko More telling, however, are the fundamentals. ETF inflows have reached nearly $1 billion in June alone — the largest since spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in July 2024. Analysts say the weekly $600 million inflow marks the strongest institutional move since last year’s cycle peak. On-chain signals are equally strong. Exchange reserves have dropped to a record low, with only 18.57 million ETH remaining — a metric many interpret as long-term accumulation. Meanwhile, staking participation is rising, with an additional 80,000 ETH staked in just the last week. Ethereum’s roadmap continues to attract holders seeking future-proof infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Analyst Attention as 2025’s Most-Watched Altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE is establishing itself with speed, scale, and unstoppable momentum. Already catching the eye of strategic analyst desks and long-term crypto holders, this altcoin is developing its powerful narrative — one that’s backed by fundamentals, not hype. The project operates with a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, creating a scarcity-driven framework that fuels long-term value. A HashEx-audited smart contract ensures integrity, while its 100% decentralized ownership — with no VC control — puts the power directly in the hands of investors. Analysts are watching closely. With early participation resembling patterns seen in previous breakout cycles, some are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE “a top-tier candidate to outperform every token this year.” Multiple research desks have reported increasing interest from investors who previously engaged with early-phase meme leaders and are now rotating capital toward high-potential altcoins with real use cases. Momentum isn’t slowing. With exchange listings approaching and a marketing surge imminent, the window for early entry is closing fast. This is precisely the phase where serious gains are made — before exposure scales and liquidity soars. Final Thoughts Ethereum and Solana are continuing to evolve. Their ecosystems are complex, institutionally favored, and technologically deep. But while they wrestle with regulation, upgrades, and performance benchmarks, a new force is rising from a completely different foundation. Analysts tracking Layer-1 and altcoin movement have placed MAGACOIN FINANCE at the top of their 2025 watchlists — not because of speculative hype, but because of structural advantage. Every technical forecast, early-stage signal, and buyer activity trend points in one direction: MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining ground, and fast.

However, a closer look at the market data and technical indicators shows that such expectations may be overly optimistic for now. Impressive Growth, But Fundamental Challenges Remain In the 100 days since Pi Network’s Open Mainnet launch, the project has achieved milestones. Over 3 million new users have joined the platform, bringing the total number of active pioneers to more than 13 million. Additionally, over 400,000 nodes are now live, supporting the decentralized network. Several new initiatives have been rolled out, including Pi Ventures, a $100 million fund for startups, and Fruity Pi, a casual gaming app. The recent PiFest 2025 event also saw over 1.2 million sellers participate, showing the network’s attempt to evolve from a mining app into a functioning commercial ecosystem. Despite this progress, Pi Coin’s price has struggled in recent weeks. The token fell by nearly 30% over the past month and is currently down over 7% today, trading around $0.50. This drop brings the price alarmingly close to a key support level at $0.40. Technical indicators also paint a bearish picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) has fallen to 30, typically a sign of oversold conditions. However, analysts observe there’s no confirmation of a bullish reversal yet. One crypto analyst stated on social media, “I’ll be surprised if Pi doesn’t hit $0.40 in July.” Is $10 a Realistic Target? According to a recent Pi Network price prediction by CoinDCX, the early part of 2025 was expected to see bulls taking strong control, potentially driving Pi’s price above $4.80 to $5.00 by mid-year. However, as we’re now at the halfway point of the year, those bullish targets remain far from reality, with Pi currently struggling around $0.50. The platform’s longer-term forecast sees Pi ranging from $3.3 to $5.5 in 2025, and potentially reaching $9.1 by 2027. For Pi to approach the much-hyped $10 mark, it would require sustained demand, increased exchange listings, and greater real-world utility — none of which are confirmed at this stage. Even if Pi were to reclaim its previous peak valuation relative to Bitcoin, it would only imply a 190% increase from current levels, putting its market capitalization at approximately $26 billion. Such a valuation would place Pi among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, a position many analysts believe would be difficult to justify given the project’s current adoption and liquidity.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-22 04:32:42
46522181,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=753152,1750567488,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46522181.jpeg,Michael Saylor says Bitcoin will hit $21M by 2046,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/saylor-says-bitcoin-will-hit-21m-by-2046/,"Strategy founder Michael Saylor predicts that Bitcoin will hit $21 million in the next 21 years. In a Saturday X post , he commented, “$21 million in 21 years.” However, he noted that getting to $21 million per BTC may be fraught with significant price swings given the token’s high volatility. Saylor says the recent geopolitical and regulatory developments influenced his BTC expectations In his previous statements, he argued on the significance of the number “21,” noting its connection to Bitcoin’s total supply and now its projected $21 million price point. He strongly believes the asset will reach his target by 2046. Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 event on Saturday, he affirmed that this could be the one time in Bitcoin’s timeline when a 21-year outlook aligns with a $21 million valuation. His new projection is a significant step-up from his previous prediction at the 2024 Bitcoin conference in Nashville, where he stated Bitcoin would reach $13 million by 2045 . He asserted that his heightened bullish outlook on Bitcoin was shaped by recent developments in geopolitics, regulation, and adoption—none of which, he noted, were anticipated a year ago. Saylor claimed he did not expect the White House to embrace and advocate for Bitcoin, acknowledging that Donald Trump’s presidential victory marked a huge political turning point last November. He pointed out that while there was optimism about having a pro-Bitcoin leader, they did not think they would get a strategic BTC reserve, or a President who’s set to make the country the Bitcoin superpower of the world. He also touched on the new regulatory and legislative developments around crypto, including the stablecoin-focused Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act, adding that no one could have guessed that states would embrace BTC. While he remains bullish that BTC will soon reach $21 million, he also predicts a volatile ride for the token. He, however, forecasts the fluctuations to eventually level out, projecting a solid 21% CAGR over time. He added that the token could very well continue to surpass the S&P 500 each year till 2046. Saylor has never disclosed where Strategy’s BTC holdings are Aside from Saylor’s bullish prediction, his company, Strategy, has maintained its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, adding another $1 billion in BTC last week. The company held about 592,100 BTC as of June 15, 2025, but it has not disclosed how and where it stores its holdings. Saylor was very vocal about his disapproval of the concept of proof-of-reserves. Speaking at the May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, he argued that PoR dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges, and the investors. Last year, Saylor also rejected the concept of self-custody, contradicting many Bitcoin holders. After receiving much criticism from the crypto community for encouraging the use of banks rather than self-custody, he shifted to voicing support for the method for individuals who are “willing and able.” At the BTC Prague event, many attendees seemed drawn to the idea of self-custody, citing “be your own bank” principles. Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at the hardware wallet company, Trezor, even confirmed that the event attendees included “a vibrant mix of developers, Bitcoiners, and newcomers — all genuinely interested in open-source tools and the principles of self-custody.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

ETF-Driven Volume Suggests a Major Price Shift Is Coming,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-xrp-ready-to-reclaim-the-3-level-etf-driven-volume-suggests-a-major-price-shift-is-coming/,"As crypto markets regain strength in mid-2025, investor focus is zeroing in on a handful of digital assets showing outsized momentum. At the top of that list are XRP and the fast-rising MAGACOIN FINANCE. Having received the attention of a serious investor MAGACOIN FINANCE is already set for an explosive presale growth. With Ripple nearing settlement with the SEC and odds of an XRP spot ETF climbing sharply, the stage is set for a potential price eruption. At the same time, MAGACOIN’s blend of scarcity, transparency, and political branding is positioning it as a breakout contender in the altcoin rally. ETF Approval Odds Hit 85% — Institutional Access May Be Near After nearly four years of legal limbo, XRP may finally get the regulatory clarity it’s long awaited. The June 2025 joint filing by Ripple Labs and the SEC signals what could be the final chapter of the high-profile litigation. Both parties submitted a motion to Judge Torres seeking an indicative ruling that would allow XRP sales to institutional investors once again. If granted, Ripple will pay a reduced penalty of $50 million, and both sides will drop their appeals. XRP’s institutional legitimacy got a major boost when Bloomberg analysts and prediction markets like Polymarket pegged the odds of spot ETF approval at 85%. This follows the SEC’s approval of XRP futures ETFs under ProShares Trust in April and CME Group’s pending listing of XRP futures alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. The industry now awaits the SEC’s decision on Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF filing, expected by June 17. A green light would be transformative, allowing traditional investors to gain XRP exposure via regulated financial products. XRP’s price has been in a holding pattern, trading between $1.90 and $2.90 for over six months. Long-term sentiment remains bullish. Several prominent analysts and traders are highlighting the confluence of ETF speculation, legal clarity, and increasing derivatives market depth as critical factors that could catalyze a renewed rally past $3. How MAGACOIN FINANCE is Quietly Gaining Ground MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining momentum as a standout among early-stage altcoins. With a locked 170 billion token supply, MAGACOIN is leveraging scarcity as a structural strength. The project is in an active presale, the price making it one of the most accessible and hyped early-stage tokens of the year. Its independently audited smart contract (via HashEx), combined with full community ownership—no VC or private unlocks—adds to its credibility. MAGACOIN has become a leading speculative pick as analysts project 35x to 100x returns in optimal conditions. Early signs of staking success, surging wallet activity, and incoming centralized exchange news are only fueling more attention. Analysts are already positioning MAGACOIN in the same conversation as XRP, Solana, and Aptos—not just as a meme or trend, but as a serious investment vehicle in a high-momentum cycle. Final Thoughts XRP stands at the edge of a major breakout moment. Legal resolution, ETF approval odds, and whale-driven volume all align in a way not seen since its previous highs. If current momentum continues and the Franklin Templeton ETF is approved, XRP reclaiming—and potentially exceeding—the $3 level appears increasingly probable. At the same time, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer asymmetric opportunities for those seeking high-upside plays with strong early momentum. With its transparent tokenomics, audit-backed infrastructure, and rapidly growing community, MAGACOIN is proving it’s more than just a flash-in-the-pan—it’s a force building alongside the market’s giants. As the crypto market transitions from regulatory uncertainty to institutional acceleration, both XRP and MAGACOIN are names investors will want to watch closely in the coming weeks.

This breakdown was triggered by escalating geopolitical tensions, as news broke that the United States had launched attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The announcement sent shockwaves through global markets, sparking widespread risk-off behavior and panic selling across crypto. Ethereum, already trading near the bottom of its six-week consolidation range, quickly reacted with a sharp drop, dragging the broader altcoin market with it. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels – Here’s Why The move marks a critical shift in sentiment, as Ethereum now trades outside the range that had served as a battleground between bulls and bears for over a month. With volatility spiking and confidence shaken, traders are re-evaluating risk in light of escalating conflict in the Middle East and broader macroeconomic headwinds. According to top analyst Big Cheds, Ethereum’s weekly chart is now flirting with a potential tower top pattern completion — a bearish reversal structure that may signal further downside unless buyers reclaim key levels in the coming days. As the situation evolves, all eyes will remain on ETH’s ability to hold new support levels or risk further decline in a fragile market environment. Ethereum Slides 22% From June Highs – All Eyes On Weekly Structure Ethereum has lost over 22% of its value since peaking in early June, as global instability and heightened selling pressure weigh heavily on market sentiment. The asset has now broken below its six-week range, triggering concern among investors and adding to uncertainty across the broader crypto space. With rising tensions in the Middle East—particularly following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities—the market has entered a risk-off environment, dragging altcoins like Ethereum into deeper retracements. Despite the volatility, Ethereum remains at the center of investor focus, as many still expect it to lead the next altseason. However, with bulls losing control of key support zones, confidence in a near-term rally continues to waver. Analysts are now split: while some predict a deeper retracement toward the $2,000 region, others argue that Ethereum is nearing exhaustion on the downside and may soon recover. Big Cheds points to Ethereum’s weekly chart, where the price is currently flirting with a potential tower top pattern—a bearish reversal structure. If this pattern confirms, ETH may face another wave of downside before finding demand at lower supply levels. If buyers step in during this pivotal moment, a recovery from this structure could quickly follow. The coming sessions will be critical in determining whether this breakdown extends or turns into a fakeout with bullish continuation. For now, traders should remain cautious, as Ethereum’s next move could define the tone of the altcoin market heading into July. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% – Smart Contract Activity Accelerates Ethereum Breaks Down Below Support As Volatility Spikes Ethereum has officially broken below the $2,320 support level, signaling a shift in short-term market structure as shown in the 4-hour chart. After weeks of ranging between $2,320 and $2,650, ETH failed to reclaim its moving averages and lost bullish momentum. The price is now trading around $2,260, down sharply from its June highs near $2,900. This recent leg down follows a clean breakdown through the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs, confirming a strong bearish momentum. Volume spikes accompanied the drop, suggesting panic selling likely triggered by geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East. The price broke down aggressively with little resistance, meaning previous demand zones have now become weak. If buyers fail to step in quickly, Ethereum may revisit earlier May support levels around $2,100 or even $2,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom – All Eyes On Next Move From a technical standpoint, the breakdown invalidates the previous consolidation range, opening the door for a possible extended correction. Until ETH reclaims $2,320 and stabilizes above its moving averages, the risk of continued downside remains high. Market participants should watch closely for volume shifts or bullish divergences, but for now, Ethereum remains under pressure as uncertainty continues to dominate the macro environment. The next few sessions will be crucial for price discovery.

Chainlink’s price prediction looks strong, with bullish divergence forming and solid support around 15.50. If it clears 17.70, a push above 20 may follow. Litecoin, on the other hand, shows bearish signs after slipping under key levels, yet June tends to be a recovery month for LTC, historically delivering an 8.9% gain. But Unstaked is not waiting on trends. It’s building something different. Its platform will use $UNSD for tools like Discord and Telegram agents, all running without code. With the Stage 21 presale at $0.011739 and a target price of $0.1819, the 2,700% ROI potential puts Unstaked in the spotlight for anyone chasing the best long-term crypto this year. Chainlink Signals a Rebound Setup Could This Be the Lift-Off? Chainlink might be ready to bounce. A bullish divergence with RSI points to strength under the surface. Price is holding above 15.50, a support level that adds more weight to a possible recovery. If LINK pushes through 17.70, it could target 20 soon. With steady demand for oracle services and growing interest in its tech, Chainlink is one to watch. For traders eyeing solid fundamentals and a pattern-based breakout, this dip might be the moment to move. Litecoin Drops Again But Could June Deliver Another Comeback? Litecoin has dipped 3.6% to about $89, falling from a recent high near $94. It dropped below its 20-day moving average and showed a bearish signal on Bollinger Bands. With volume also down, pressure may pull it toward $83 unless buying returns. Still, June tends to be kind to Litecoin. The token usually sees strong monthly gains around this time and even posted a 12% bounce last month. If that trend holds, LTC could aim for $97. For those tracking seasonal moves, this pullback may be setting the stage for another bounce. Meme AI Coins Make Noise, But Unstaked Is Building the Real Thing Many AI crypto coins grab attention with bold promises and buzzwords, but Unstaked is focused on delivery. The $UNSD token powers AI tools that automate tasks across Telegram, Discord, and DAO platforms. These agents need no coding to deploy and will be launched after the token goes live. Every time they’re used, demand for $UNSD rises, tying token use directly to utility. Unstaked isn’t here for hype. It’s made for users and teams who want real automation that gets things done. Now in Stage 21 of its presale, $UNSD is priced at $0.011739, with a projected launch value of $0.1819. That’s a possible 2,700% upside. While others promise the future, Unstaked is putting the pieces in place now. If you’re chasing meme AI coins with no working platform, it might be time to switch tracks. The real AI wave in Web3 could be starting with $UNSD. The clock is ticking on this crypto presale , and so is the price window. Final Analysis Chainlink is showing signs of strength, with technical setups hinting at a breakout above 17.70. If it holds, a push toward 20 could come fast, giving traders something to watch. Litecoin is under pressure, but past moves in June suggest it might bounce again, keeping it in the conversation. Still, when the focus shifts to long-term value, Unstaked leads the pack. It brings real tools, clear demand, and a product built for Web3’s future. Unlike coins relying on charts or sentiment, $UNSD grows through real usage. With a current price of $0.011739 and a projected listing near $0.1819, the 2,700% ROI potential is backed by more than just hope. Unstaked isn’t following trends, it’s building them.

These 4 Might Be Q3’s Big Winners!,https://thecoinrise.com/trying-to-find-the-best-crypto-to-buy-right-now-these-4-might-be-q3s-big-winners/,"With Q3 officially underway, smart traders are scanning the market for the best cryptos to buy right now and set themselves up for solid gains. But in a space full of hype and short-term pumps, not every project makes the cut. The most profitable picks heading into 2025 are the ones backed by real use-cases, strong fundamentals, and growing demand. This article filters out the noise and puts the spotlight on four standout cryptos that are actually built to deliver long-term value and serious upside in the months ahead. 1. Web3 ai: The Smart Trader’s Secret with 10x Upside! While still in its presale stage, Web3 ai is quickly making its mark as one of the best cryptos to buy right now. The project has already raised over $8.3 million, with 22.5 billion coins sold, clear signs that it’s catching the market’s attention. What sets it apart is its focus on giving everyday traders access to AI tools once reserved for larger players. A standout feature is the Crypto Scam Detector, which analyzes smart contracts, wallet activity, and online signals to identify scams before they strike. Another is the DeFi Yield Farming Advisor, built to uncover better staking and farming options while automating the process to help boost returns. All of this runs on real-time data, giving users the latest market information exactly when they need it. The WAI token, which powers the Web3 ai platform and includes governance rights, is priced at $0.0004433 in stage 9 of the presale. With a launch price of $0.005242, early buyers could see a 1084% return from day one. Backed by real tools and strong upside, WAI is one of the most promising tokens this quarter. 2. Chainlink: The Data Backbone of Web3 Chainlink ($LINK) is gaining serious traction as one of the top cryptos to buy right now, and for good reason. It plays a key role in helping blockchains connect with real-world data, powering everything from DeFi platforms to insurance apps. With major players like Google Cloud and Oracle now on board, Chainlink’s reach is expanding fast. This kind of real-world adoption shows it’s more than just hype, it’s useful tech that industries actually need. As demand for smarter Web3 applications grows, so does the need for Chainlink. Currently trading at $13.07, it’s looking like a solid bet for long-term growth. 3. VeChain: The Supply Chain Fixer VeChain ($VET) isn’t chasing trends; it’s quietly becoming a key player in fixing broken supply chains. With global supply chains under pressure, VeChain offers a way to verify where products come from and how they move, all on the blockchain. This tech is already being used in sectors like healthcare and luxury goods to fight counterfeits and improve transparency. As more companies lean into digital tracking and sustainability, VeChain stands out as a go-to solution. It’s currently priced at $0.02157, making it a low-cost entry with room to grow as adoption builds. 4. Hedera: The Enterprise-Grade Engine Rounding out this list of the best cryptos to buy in Q3 is Hedera ($HBAR), a project built for real-world scale and enterprise use. Currently trading at $0.1467, Hedera runs on Hashgraph, a unique system that’s faster, more secure, and more energy-efficient than traditional blockchains. This makes it a strong choice for businesses and governments looking for reliable blockchain solutions. With smart contracts now live and partnerships growing across sectors like finance and public services, Hedera is showing real progress as it moves deeper into mainstream adoption. Which Is The Best Crypto to Buy Right Now? Chainlink, VeChain, and Hedera all bring something unique to the table, whether it’s real-time data, supply chain tracking, or enterprise-ready tech. They’re solid picks with strong real-world use. But when it comes to combining utility with serious upside, Web3 ai is tough to beat. Priced at just $0.0004433 in Stage 9, it’s quickly catching market interest. With tools that help traders spot scams, optimize portfolios, and boost returns, plus a projected 1084% ROI, this could be the smartest early entry buy right now.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to $631.7 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.48 percent of its value today. Technical indicators give a negative signal, but the price charts project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support and the price moved toward $631.7. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.48 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,190.17 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into June, BNB is trading approximately $666.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-22 05:30:00

At press time, shares of the Yes side of the Polymarket-listed contract ""Will Iran Close the Strait of Hormuz before June 30 traded at 40 cents, representing a 40% probability. That's a notable increase from 14% Saturday. Meanwhile, the odds of the event occurring by the end of the year increased to 52%, up from 33% the previous day. Approximately 20 million barrels of oil are transported through the Strait of Hormuz daily, accounting for around 20% of the world's oil consumption, according to the Middle East Forum Observer . Therefore, the potential closure of the Hormuz could trigger a sustained oil price shock. According to JPMorgan's analysts , shutting the Strait of Hormuz could catapult crude oil prices to an eye-popping $120 to $130 per barrel. Such a spike in oil prices, coupled with the ongoing trade war, could lead to stagflation – the worst outcome for financial assets, including cryptocurrencies. As of writing, the cryptocurrency market has not shown any signs of panic, with bitcoin BTC continuing to trade above $100,000, per CoinDesk data. President Donald Trump confirmed airstrikes Saturday evening, saying the attack Obliterated three critical Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, calling ""the bully of the Middle East [Iran] to make peace.""",Markets|Iran|Oil|Markets|Polymarket|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-22 05:43:12

Experts Warn of a Possible $1.55 Test,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-crash-25-experts-warn-of-a-possible-1-55-test/,"The post XRP Price to Crash 25%? Experts Warn of a Possible $1.55 Test appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and XRP is showing signs of weakness despite recently climbing above a descending trendline that had capped every rally since February. After slipping back under key resistance levels, analysts now warn that XRP could be at risk of a deeper pullback in the coming sessions. At the time of writing, XRP is struggling to hold support around $2.10, having dipped as low as $2.03. Analyst CasiTrades warns that while XRP briefly reclaimed its breakout level, the move could be a false breakout. She added that if open interest begins to rise without a meaningful price move, particularly if it crosses 0.02% or higher — it could signal a high probability of a liquidity sweep to the downside. “If we fail to hold $2.25, it puts $2.01, $1.90, and even $1.55 in play,” she explained. A capitulation move toward these lower levels, while painful in the short term, could generate the exact momentum XRP needs to finally break free of its multi-year range. CasiTrades said such a shakeout could pave the way for a powerful Wave 3 breakout in the coming weeks. Technical indicators support the bearish short-term outlook. RSI and Stochastic indicators on the daily and 4-hour charts are showing oversold conditions, hinting at continued selling pressure before a possible rebound. The market is currently watching the $1.95–$1.88 zone closely for signs of stabilization. Adding to the uncertainty, XRP’s price action remains closely tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. As both major cryptocurrencies trade within tight ranges and show signs of a potential pullback, altcoins like XRP are likely to mirror this behavior. While short-term risks remain high, some analysts remain positive about XRP’s medium-term prospects. If the market can shake off current bearish sentiment, XRP could recover towards $2.25–$2.35 initially, with more ambitious targets of $3 by the end of July if bullish momentum builds.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-22 05:52:41

The token has been making higher spikes since November 7, 2024, after which its value has deteriorated.

The overwhelming majority of growth came from USDT and USDC, which together account for 93.5% of the circulating supply. USDtb by Ethena and USD0 by Usual are also making strong debuts. The same cannot be said for traditional finance-backed stablecoins. TradFi Misses the Mark According to the latest report by CoinGecko, traditional finance-backed stablecoins like PayPal’s PYUSD and SocGen’s EURCV struggled to gain meaningful traction. Despite brand recognition and regulatory alignment, both coins have seen limited adoption and utility in a market dominated by crypto-native incumbents. Their underperformance pointed to the challenges TradFi institutions face in competing with established decentralized players. However, the door remains open for future entrants, particularly as the US edges closer to regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, commodity-backed tokens experienced a 67.8% market cap increase during the same period, as this cohort added $773.9 million and reached a record $1.9 billion during a period of economic volatility. This growth closely mirrored the rally in gold prices, as investors turned to the metal as a hedge against mounting geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. Despite this, the segment remains a minor player, and comprises just 0.8% of the total value of fiat-backed stablecoins. Even with strong tailwinds from gold, commodity-backed tokens expanded at a slower pace than their fiat counterparts. Tether Gold (XAUT) and PAX Gold (PAXG) continue to lead, and collectively make up 84% of the category’s total market cap. Interestingly, this surge in market value did not coincide with an increase in token issuance, indicating that the demand for tokenized commodities stayed relatively flat and was largely influenced by asset appreciation rather than increased adoption or new users entering the space. Tokenized Treasuries See Breakout Year Beyond stablecoins and tokenized commodities, another corner of the real-world asset space saw even more explosive growth. In April 2025, the tokenized treasury market hit an all-time high, with a total market cap of $5.6 billion. This is a 544.8% increase from the previous year, which makes it the strongest-performing RWA class during the period. A major catalyst for this growth occurred in March 2025, when the US introduced sweeping trade tariffs, which fueled investor flight to safer assets. Between March and April alone, tokenized treasuries added $2.3 billion in value, up 67.1%. BlackRock’s BUIDL token, launched in July 2024, quickly became the category leader and accounted for 44% of the total market by April. The product saw explosive growth in 2025, as it rose by more than 372% to end April with $2.5 billion in tokenized treasuries. While these digital assets are now issued across several blockchain networks, Ethereum remains dominant, with Stellar in second place. Despite rapid expansion, overall user participation is still relatively narrow, as tokenized treasuries are distributed across just over 11,000 individual on-chain addresses.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/expert-predicts-face-melting-xrp-breakout-heres-the-timeline/,"A new post from well-known crypto commentator Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) has stirred conversation around the long-term outlook for XRP, pointing to a bullish macro structure that, according to him, remains overlooked due to the market’s narrow focus on Bitcoin. The comment came in response to a chart shared by another analyst, which displayed a clear symmetrical triangle formation on the asset’s monthly chart. Cobb took the discussion further, declaring that XRP possesses “one of the most beautifully painted bullish macro charts in all of crypto.” XRP has one of the most beautifully painted bullish macro charts in all of crypto Market is way too tunnel visioned on Bitcoin to understand this The facemelting/sideline tears are going to be of epic proportions end of 2025 https://t.co/UNdh9qZAot — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 20, 2025 A Macro View Being Ignored Cobb emphasized that market participants are largely dismissing XRP’s structure due to what he described as “tunnel-visioned” attention on Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has long held dominance in the market, Cobb believes that this bias is obscuring more technically significant setups forming in altcoins, such as XRP. The chart shows XRP’s pronounced upward move from late 2024, followed by the months of consolidation. This consolidation phase formed a symmetrical triangle, supporting Cobb’s interpretation of a developing breakout scenario. Other analysts have suggested that XRP is at the end of this consolidation phase and expect a breakout soon. If the breakout occurs, this structure suggests that XRP could continue its previous rally, targeting higher levels this time. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 End-of-Year Expectations Importantly, Cobb attached a timeline to his forecast. He expects the implications of this chart to materialize toward the end of 2025, a period he believes will produce “face-melting/sideline tears… of epic proportions.” Experts have predicted targets as high as $10 for the end of 2025. Historically, macro consolidation patterns such as symmetrical triangles often resolve with trend continuation. The XRP monthly chart highlighting this pattern aligns with that classical setup. Recognizing XRP’s Potential Despite the clarity Cobb sees in the chart, broader market attention remains centered on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cobb suggests that many will be caught off guard if XRP follows through on the technical setup now in play. A swift rise will price out many investors , but those who can see the asset’s potential will benefit significantly when the price starts climbing. XRP is in a unique position, as Bitcoin maximalists are now recognizing its potential. Davinci Jeremie, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, recently predicted that XRP will reach $24 by the end of 2025 , demonstrating that even its biggest detractors cannot detract from its true value.

Initially, he estimated that 95% of XRP investors would be “left behind”. He has now revised that estimate, stating that 99% of holders may eventually exit the market, not due to lack of belief, but because of unavoidable financial pressures. Farina cited the ongoing economic downturn as the primary reason many retail holders are likely to sell prematurely. In his view, inflation is diminishing the real value of money at a rapid pace. He explained that “$100 today feels like $10 yesterday” and “The cost of living keeps increasing. He believes this erosion of purchasing power is making it increasingly difficult for investors to hold onto speculative assets like XRP, especially when facing everyday expenses. He also pointed to global layoffs caused by automation and artificial intelligence, alongside rising debt obligations such as student loans, as key contributors to this financial strain. Farina explained that many individuals are left with no option but to sell their XRP to meet essential living costs. The Difficulty of Holding XRP Amid Mounting Costs Farina argues that in the current environment, even owning what was once considered a modest amount of XRP is becoming a financial luxury. At current prices, acquiring 1,000 XRP costs over $2,100, and reaching 10,000 XRP would require over $21,000—sums that are increasingly inaccessible for average investors. According to him, the opportunity to accumulate such amounts may soon disappear for most. He believes that the inability to retain XRP holdings is not due to doubts in the asset’s future, but rather a reflection of worsening financial circumstances. For Farina, the challenge isn’t just about buying XRP, but being able to resist selling in difficult times. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Practical Steps to Stay in the Top 1% In light of his projection that 99% of XRP holders may be forced to exit prematurely, Farina offered several suggestions for those aiming to be among the 1% who remain. He strongly advised against selling XRP to cover everyday expenses, especially for those who anticipate long-term price targets of $100 or more. Farina cautioned that once sold, XRP may be difficult to reacquire if prices rise significantly, referencing past movements from $0.50 to over $2 as an example. He encouraged investors to seek out alternative sources of income. According to him, remote jobs and online work could help reduce the pressure to sell holdings prematurely. He also suggested that individuals consider relocating to lower-cost regions to ease the burden of rising living costs. Additionally, Farina urged investors to use their smartphones as tools for generating income. He encourages creativity and resourcefulness as strategies for long-term participation in the XRP market . His central message is that maintaining XRP holdings requires more than belief—it requires adaptation. Outlook for XRP Investors Farina maintains that the opportunity to secure a place among the 1% who benefit from a potential major XRP price surge still exists, but time and conditions are working against most investors. He warned that once the price climbs beyond current levels, re-entry will become far more difficult for those who sold early. In his view, those who can resist the pressure to liquidate and instead adopt alternative strategies to manage their finances will be better positioned for potential future gains. Farina’s final message to the XRP community is clear: long-term success in this market may require sacrifices and a change of lifestyle. But those actions could determine who thrives and who is left behind. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In collaboration with Bybit and Solana Foundation, the platform sets out to build towards a truly distributed financial system accessible to everyone. A Platform with Laser-Sharp Purpose: Bringing Authenticity Back On-Chain At its core, Byreal is building a genuine, open, and transparent financial order. It seeks to welcome both professional and retail participants into a unified onchain economy where capital is deployed with conviction. This vision is a direct response to what the DeFi space has become: overrun by short-termism, unaudited promises, and superficial growth signals. Byreal believes it is time to reset the narrative—to build infrastructure that rewards substance over noise. To achieve this, Byreal focuses on three core principles: Builder-first – empowering quality projects through curated listings and community-centric launch mechanisms Trader-centric – offering CEX-level execution and tooling without compromising DeFi values Liquidity-deep – bridging blue-chip and real-world assets with Solana’s composability and speed This foundational ethos translates into a suite of flagship products purpose-built to rewire the DeFi experience. Introduces 3 flagship Byreal products – from DEX, Launchpad to Vault 1. Byreal DEX Powered by a smart-routing engine that fuses CLMM and RFQ, the Byreal DEX enables gasless, zero price impact trades with robust MEV protection. In internal benchmarks, the DEX achieved quote speeds of under 200ms, with RFQ orders consistently executing at requested terms, delivering zero slippage and zero gas fees, setting a new standard for decentralized trading on Solana. 2. Reset Launch The platform’s launchpad introduces features like the Smart Price Ladder, Fairshare Engine, and price-based allocation mechanics, a direct answer to the industry-harming inefficiencies of blind airdrop farming. Reset Launch enables real investors to access high-quality IDOs with fairness, transparency, and aligned incentives. 3. Revive Vault Offering frictionless yield strategies, Revive Vault includes bbSOL-exclusive vaults , diverse ecosystem selections, and integrated on/off-chain yield flows. This empowers users to deploy capital across Solana with efficiency, security, and competitive returns. Together, these products form a unified, full-cycle growth engine, supporting asset discovery, trading, and yield generation in one composable interface. Additionally, Byreal provides real asset accessibility, dual liquidity engines, and institutional-grade execution into a unified, full-cycle growth engine supporting asset discovery, trading, and yield generation across multiple ecosystems. Emily Bao, Founder of Byreal, said, “A great exchange doesn’t just facilitate transactions — it helps the world discover what’s truly valuable and gives those assets the liquidity they deserve. The next wave of value won’t be unlocked by hype, but by platforms that help real assets find real markets. Byreal is built to do exactly that — turning fragmented liquidity into unified opportunity.” Ben Zhou, Co-founder and CEO of Bybit, states, “The future of trading lies in the seamless integration of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Byreal embodies this vision by serving as the on-chain outpost of CEX while bringing blue-chip assets and institutional-grade liquidity into the decentralized world. Bybit is proud to pioneer this CEX+DEX integration trend, leading the way for a new era of unlocking unprecedented liquidity and market access.” Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, said, “Byreal’s focus on improving liquidity infrastructure and bringing capital market assets onchain is closely aligned with Solana’s long-term vision. We’re encouraged by the team’s approach to building DeFi-native tools that prioritize accessibility, efficiency, and composability on Solana.” Byreal’s testnet is live now, with its mainnet launch scheduled for late Q3 2025. Note: Byreal is a standalone entity. It is not accessible through, or affiliated with any product offerings from Bybit Global or Bybit EU. About Byreal Byreal is the ultimate liquidity layer built for real assets, delivering unmatched liquidity for users. It integrates DEX, Launch, and Vault into a unified smart routing architecture, forming a full-cycle growth engine that supports asset discovery, trading, and yield generation across multiple ecosystems. https://x.com/byreal_io This post Byreal Launches with Strategic Support from Bybit on Solana first appeared on BitcoinWorld and is written by chainwire",Press Release,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-06-22 06:53:27

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 66,600 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be mirroring gold’s 2024 price action, when the precious metal struggled to clear resistance at $2,100 for multiple weeks before sparking a huge upside burst. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is likely consolidating below $110,000 to set the stage for a breakout and a parabolic rally to new all-time high prices. “Look at the $2,000-ish level [of gold]. This is the kind of asset we are now. If you expect anything else other than this, I think you’re just wrong… You see that breakout level that got tested four times, and you [had] false breakouts… I mean [gold] didn’t move for the longest time, and then it just went up only forever, which is kind of nuts to observe. But basically, I feel we’re that asset now, where you’re going to flirt with the same level like three or four times and people are going to lose all their money before it breaks out.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube At time of writing, gold is worth $3,368 while Bitcoin is trading for $102,114.

But that’s exactly what Jetking, a name once known for making radios and televisions in India, has done. The company, which later moved into IT education, faced tough times during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world shut down, Jetking’s 200 centers across India saw business dry up. Forced to rethink their future, the leadership explored around 15 different ideas to revive the company. In the end, they made a big move: to transform into a Bitcoin-centric company. In an interview with Coinpedia, CFO Siddarth Bharwani said, “Jetking’s decision to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset has had both symbolic and financial implications, The move sparked interest from a new class of investors, particularly younger or tech-savvy retail investors.” The company is aiming to hold 210 Bitcoins by the end of 2025. Navigating India’s 30% Crypto Tax India’s strict 30% tax on crypto profits hasn’t made things easy. But Jetking has taken a different route. “We follow a ‘Never Sell Bitcoin’ strategy,” Bharwani explained. This means the company doesn’t realize profits on its Bitcoin holdings, avoiding taxable events. Any changes in value are simply noted as revaluation reserves in the financial reports. Handling RBI’s Crypto Concerns The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has repeatedly raised concerns about crypto being used for illegal cross-border transfers, like hawala. Jetking says it takes these worries seriously and uses a compliance-first approach. All Bitcoin is bought via regulated, FIU-registered exchanges and stored with institutional-grade custodians that follow KYC and AML checks. Hopes for Better Crypto Laws in India As India works on a formal set of crypto rules, Jetking hopes for fairer regulations. The company supports government oversight but wants a shift from the flat 30% tax to a graded capital gains model based on how long crypto is held. “We expect shift from a flat 30% tax on gains to a graded capital gains tax model based on holding period. Enable carry-forward and offset of losses, as is the case with other financial assets and GST exemption or clarity when crypto is used purely as a treasury reserve, not as payment or service,” they said.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-22 07:05:37

Speaking from the White House, Trump said any future strikes would be “far greater and a lot easier” if Iran retaliated. He gave no details about what kind of peace he expects or what Tehran would need to do. But the threat was clear: stop now, or get hit harder. According to reporting from Tasnim and other official statements, Iran didn’t wait long to respond, it launched missiles at Israel, officially escalating the fight. Trump had spent weeks saying he wanted a nuclear deal with Iran, even after Israel’s initial attack. He claimed Iran was open to it. But by Tuesday, his tone changed. First, he told reporters he didn’t want a ceasefire—he wanted “an end, a real end.” Hours later, on Truth Social, he posted “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” in all caps. Two days later, he gave himself a two-week deadline to decide whether to launch a strike. He said there was still a “substantial chance” for diplomacy. By Saturday night, that chance was gone. US jets hit Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan sites, pulling American forces into another war in the Middle East. Crypto bounces after modest drop Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies dropped fast when the attack news hit. Within minutes, Bitcoin fell below $100,000, SOL hit $121, Ether dropped to $2,300, and XRP touched $2.09. But two hours later, prices had bounced back. Bitcoin was back above 102k, SOL rose over 130, and Ether and XRP held steady. The crypto market’s reaction was fast, chaotic, and short-lived. Investors didn’t wait to panic though at all. They bought the dip and moved on. Meanwhile, the Iranian foreign ministry called Trump’s strikes a “dangerous war against Iran.” In a statement carried by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, the government said the US had “betrayed diplomacy” and described Israel as “genocidal and lawless.” It said Trump’s actions violated international law and the UN Charter and warned of “grave consequences and dire repercussions.” They also said it was Iran’s “legitimate right to fully and resolutely resist” and defend its national interests “by all necessary means.” Iran called on the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency to respond immediately. The government asked the UN Security Council to hold an emergency meeting. The statement urged international bodies to condemn what it called “a flagrant and criminal act of illegality.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|BTC|ILS|IRR|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-22 07:14:07

The move, announced by former President Donald Trump, saw bombers hit Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — three of Iran’s main uranium enrichment facilities. The geopolitical jolt rattled global markets and sent crypto into a tailspin on Sunday. In the past 24 hours, 172,853 traders were liquidated, with total losses hitting $681.8 million, meaning 87% of it was from longs. Ether (ETH) traders took the biggest hit with $282 million in liquidations, followed by bitcoin (BTC) tracked trades at $151 million.Futures tracking other majors, such as SOL, XRP, and DOGE also faced heavy losses, with at least over $22 million in losses.Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. Prices briefly plunged before stabilizing. Bitcoin held near $102,000, while Ethereum traded just above $2,280, both down intraday but avoiding freefall. Bybit and Binance accounted for two-thirds of all liquidations.

The data reveals that crypto wallets associated with the development team have sent 12.54 million TRUMP tokens worth a total of approximately $150.68 million to exchanges in four batches since April 28. According to the data, there are a total of $ 7.3 billion worth of altcoins on cryptocurrency exchanges associated with this memecoin and thought to belong to developers. Almost all of these are TRUMP tokens. Currently, approximately 200 million of the TRUMP tokens with a supply of 1 billion tokens are in circulation. A significant portion of the remaining tokens remain locked in developer wallets, and these tokens will be put into circulation over time.

While tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to draw attention due to their community-driven momentum and price swings, it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s seizing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance is at presale phase 5 and the price of Mutuum Finance is currently at $0.03 where 40% is already sold out. The investor interest remains very strong and the token has been purchased by more than 12,300 investors with a raise of $10.9 million. The investors who invest at this level will obtain 100% of returns on investment when the token is listed. Mutuum Finance is emerging as the next big crypto to watch, especially among those searching for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in before the next market leg up. Mutuum Finance Tops $10.9M Mark Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast turning out to be one of the hottest projects within DeFi. With a whopping $10.9 million raised and over 12,300 investors already signed up, the presale is taking serious traction. In its fifth phase, the token is selling at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors can already expect a 100% return even before the token goes on sale. Some are even predicting a post-launch price bounce to more than $2.50 before the 2025 bull run is through. Clearing the Way for Smart, Adaptive DeFi Borrowing With a user-freedom, security, and control-based lending platform, Mutuum Finance is disrupting decentralized finance. Instead of leading users towards a single model, Mutuum will provide a two-side model which makes up for several means of DeFi engagements. Its Peer-to-Contract functionality gives users an option to put USDT into smart contracts that are automated in nature where the interest rate may fluctuate depending on market activity. This is a stable, hands-off source of passive income because no manual work is required for facilitating trades. For those who prefer to have greater freedom of action, they have the option of using the Peer-to-Peer approach which gives freedom to the same groups of borrowers and lenders to talk directly to one another and determine their own terms and are not compelled to depend upon third party groups. It is an open, trustless design that allows the user complete control over their money, something that is an effective option in a more unstable environment or special lending transaction. By combining the force of automation and customization, Mutuum Finance can establish a new standard in DeFi lending; be capable of having an entirely automated product without necessarily completely giving up control of the system. Win Big: $100,000 Leaderboard and Giveaway Prizes Mutuum Finance is celebrating its fast-paced growth and thanking early bird fans by creating a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000’s worth of MUTM tokens, simply for signing up early. In addition, the project has also introduced a live leaderboard, and the top 50 MUTM tokenholders will be awarded special bonus rewards, adding a gamified touch to the presale and making it more fun to join. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most potential cryptocurrencies of June 2025 having more than 12.3k early adopters and more than $10.9 million raised. At the current price of $0.03, early entrants will receive an immediate 100 percent ROI at launch, with speculations of over 2.50 USD being possible during the subsequent bull run. Supported by a dual-mode DeFi lending platform, 100K giveaway, Certik-audited safety, and game-based incentives, Mutuum Finance has the potential to provide an effective combination of innovativeness, utility, and a grassroots energy. Do not skip your chance to take part in a presale and get your MUTM tokens now.

From the early boom of Dogecoin to the Shiba Inu craze and PEPE’s viral climb, retail investors have made millions by just being early to the projects. As we approach the fourth quarter, the opportunity to turn a few dollars into a seven-figure return is closing down. If you’re still trying to hit that $1 million return before the end of the year, four meme coins stand out as top assets: Little Pepe (LILPEPE), BONK, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With a Master Plan Among all the meme coins looking to draw the attention of investors, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is one with the strongest possibility and roadmap to achieve the needed growth. While most tokens rely on hype, LILPEPE combines the viral nature of the market with its development. The token was built as an ERC-20 standard and is currently in its third presale stage. LILPEPE is priced at $0.0012 and has already raised $1.3 million, having sold out its target in the previous rounds. What makes LILPEPE special is its plan to launch a layer 2 blockchain dedicated to meme coins. This network promises low fees, protection from sniper bots, and fast transaction speeds. These features are expected to improve the platform after it launches and starts trading meme coins. The project also plans to launch a meme coin launchpad, turning LILPEPE from an asset to a lab that is powered by meme coins. The project has already confirmed two exchange listings when it launches and investors are rushing into it. The team has also increased the excitement surrounding the project through its $777,000 giveaway, where 10 winners will each receive $77,000 worth of tokens, increasing the project’s visibility. With these features, the project is expected to be the next Pepe, but just faster and smarter. BONK: Solana’s Most Beloved Meme Coin Bonk (BONK) is a meme coin with real usage, trading at $0.00003175 on Solana. It presently has a $1.14 billion market cap. Its 60% rise in April 2025 and 1.69 trillion token burn in 2024 have helped the value of the token. Analysts have predicted a 1,500% rise in the price of the token by the end of the year. They expect that the growth will be driven by Solana’s low fees and tools like BonkSwap and BonkBot. For investors looking for meme coins with high returns, BONK is one of the tokens to consider. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): From NFT to Meme Token Stardom Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) mixes meme coin hype with NFT. The token is trading at $0.009392 with a market cap of $2.69 billion. PENGU rose as high as 800% after it launched but it fell 90% from its $0.052 high. Recent partnerships like Lufthansa’s airline miles program and Walmart’s toy sales have shown adoption. Analysts predict an 800% rise to $0.0845 by December. If the team maintains the price of the token by launching more usage in the Web3 sector, the token could see a big rise by the end of the year. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Cult Meme of 2025 Dogwifhat is a meme coin that is trading at $0.78 on Solana with a $800 million market cap. Despite its monthly drop of 41%, its 150% gain over 30 days shows it has the potential. Analysts have predicted a rise to $14.56 by the end of the year, with traders looking at a rise to $9 in the next few weeks. Traders are always looking at coins like that as they boast an active and loyal following. If the next campaign goes viral on social media, then the token could see a big rise. Final Thoughts Many investors have been entering the meme coin sector due to the big gains recorded. Getting in early is the key in this sector that rewards only those who can risk everything. Little Pepe offers real-world usage and a better roadmap, BONK offers strength, Pudgy Penguins carries recognition, and Dogwifhat relies on its viral power. A $1 million portfolio does not require perfection, it requires bold bets and timing. For investors who are ready to weather the storm, these four meme coins could be the key to financial freedom.

Market participants reacted swiftly to the dip, which pushed BTC near the bottom of its month-long trading range. The reversal gained momentum as volume accelerated, leading to a strong rebound. The move coincided with a sharply worded post from James Lavish, a Managing Partner of the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, who wrote on X : “If you are selling Bitcoin because of the possibility of the world going to war, you have absolutely no idea what you own.” The $100K–$110K range has contained price movement for nearly a month. On-chain metrics suggest a balanced market with neither excessive profit-taking nor aggressive accumulation, while derivatives data indicates cautious sentiment with continued demand for downside protection. Technical Analysis Highlights A midnight push lifted BTC above $102,800 with trading volume peaking at 17,906 BTC. Between 05:57 and 06:00, BTC climbed from $102,767 to $102,912, supported by volume spikes over 150 BTC per minute. Peak recovery-period volume hit 184.24 BTC, helping drive price toward $102,990. Minute-level consolidation around $102,680–$102,720 preceded the breakout. A higher support level began forming near $102,870 as volatility decreased.

Following a swift sell-off to $2.011 during the 21:00 hour, the asset stabilized and staged a recovery, forming a bullish ascending channel and holding support above the $2.04 level. Traders are now watching closely as XRP builds upward pressure near the $2.09 resistance line. News Background Market sentiment remains fragile as global economic uncertainty continues to weigh on risk assets. Trade tensions and policy shifts among major economies have pressured the broader crypto landscape, triggering liquidations and profit-taking across key tokens. Despite the volatility, XRP’s on-chain and technical metrics have held firm. The token continues to benefit from institutional narratives surrounding a potential spot ETF approval and Ripple’s global payments expansion. Analysts are focused on XRP’s ability to establish a new higher low, which could set the stage for a breakout if resistance at $2.09 is breached with volume confirmation. Price Action XRP posted a 6.33% range over the last 24 hours, sliding from $2.147 to $2.011 during a sharp sell-off centered around the 21:00 hour. Volume during that period spiked to over 163 million units, confirming intense downward pressure. The asset then recovered steadily, forming a higher low at $2.042 before pushing up to $2.083. In the final hour, XRP climbed from $2.078 to $2.089, marking the session’s high on a strong 1.38M volume burst at 06:20. This price action has formed a short-term ascending channel, with higher lows observed at $2.079, $2.082, and $2.083. Technical Analysis Recap XRP posted a 6.33% trading range from $2.147 to $2.011. Heaviest selling occurred at 21:00 with over 163M in volume. Higher low formed at $2.042; recovery to $2.083 suggests buyer control returning. Resistance now sits at $2.089–$2.090; support range firm at $2.011–$2.042. Final hour saw price jump to $2.089 on 1.38M volume at 06:20.

In 2027, it will range between $100.14 and $118.91, with an average price of $109.52. In 2031, it will range between $225.31 and $244.08, with an average price of $234.69. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

The coin value has dipped to a low of $34.23 in the past 24 hours. From an overall observation, the currency suffered a loss of up to 1.32% today.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present near the center of the neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 45.51 today.

HYPE/USDT 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of the Hyperliquid coin shows a bullish trend in the market. HYPE/USD value has slightly increased to $34.22 in the past few hours.

The coin value has decreased to $34.23 in the past 24 hours, as the coin is under selling pressure. According to an overall analysis, the currency has lost up to 1.32% of its value today. Technical indicators give neutral signs; on the other hand, price charts showcase a bearish market scenario. Why is Hyperliquid down? The cryptocurrency market is under correction, and HYPE is receiving the same sentiment. Moreover, it is encouraging that HYPE marked a new ATH on June 16, 2025. From a larger picture, the HYPE price decreased to $34.23, losing 1.32% of its total value in the last few hours as it is still correcting from its ATH. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by the end of 2025. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2027. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $118. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $244.08, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading a bit lower than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $244.08 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On May 26, 2025, HYPE discovered an all-time high of $39.68 and has corrected to the $31 range at the start of June.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-22 07:40:00

The sell-off, triggered by broader macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, found strong buyer interest near the $0.151 level, with volume spiking to 828 million units during the capitulation. Since then, DOGE has stabilized near $0.157, forming higher lows and hinting at a potential bottoming structure. News Background Global economic pressures — from escalating trade disputes to hawkish central bank stances — have weighed heavily on crypto markets. DOGE, often viewed as a bellwether for retail sentiment, bore the brunt of risk-off flows. But despite the volatility, network activity has remained stable, and on-chain data shows signs of accumulation. Analysts point to the $0.151 level as a crucial support zone following the 8% plunge. Central banks continue to signal concern over inflation, and with crypto markets reacting sharply to macro headlines, DOGE’s ability to recover from its lows may attract short-term traders looking for signs of a rebound. Price Action DOGE dropped sharply from $0.164 to $0.151 during the 21:00 hour on June 21, with volume exploding to 828M—the highest hourly tally in over a week. This marked a clear capitulation point, followed by a modest recovery as buyers stepped in. Price has since rebounded to the $0.157 level, forming a short-term consolidation zone. In the most recent session, DOGE printed a series of higher lows, including a small breakout attempt at 06:57 when volume spiked to nearly 8M units. Immediate resistance now sits at $0.157–$0.160, while support remains firm at $0.151. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE posted a 7.9% range over 24 hours, falling from $0.164 to $0.151. Capitulation event at 21:00 drew 828M in volume, confirming $0.151 as major support. Price rebounded to $0.157, where it’s now consolidating on declining volatility. Higher lows suggest early accumulation pattern forming. Resistance zone sits at $0.157–$0.160; bulls need a close above $0.160 for breakout confirmation. Support at $0.151 backed by extreme volume and V-shaped bounce.

His commentary builds upon earlier predictions he made in January, with new references to historical symbolism, institutional linkages, and political developments. One of the main points in Remi Relief’s latest statements is a reference to the 1992 film Sneakers, which contains a fictional screen displaying a Federal Reserve system interface. The screen, under the heading “FEDERAL RESERVE TRANSFER NODE,” includes the line: “International Telelink Access (Code Lin: XRP-262).” Though unrelated to the modern cryptocurrency XRP, the coincidental use of the term “XRP” in a Federal Reserve context has been circulating in crypto circles for several months, especially following its exposure by the user MetaMan X, as previously reported by Times Tabloid . Remi Relief uses this as evidence of what he suggests is long-running foresight or hidden signaling: “They told us back in 1992,” he wrote, accompanied by screenshots of the film’s computer interface. XRP $10,000 or $100,000…They Told Us Back In 1992 When the Trump Powell show ends…XRP will be the new Federal Reserve. I’ve been saying this since January. I hope you guys are picking up what I’m putting down •The Fantastic Four XRP XLM XDC HBAR FedNow = XRP XLM… pic.twitter.com/Bd84agNWmT — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 19, 2025 $10,000 or $100,000 XRP and the End of the Federal Reserve Remi’s message escalates from symbolic references to bold projections. He claimed that “Ripple/XRP will be the New ‘Federal Reserve’” and declared that earlier estimates of $10,000 per XRP were too conservative. Instead, he now speculates that XRP could reach $100,000. This dramatic valuation, while not supported by mainstream financial analysts, is part of a broader narrative often promoted in XRP-centric communities that anticipate a massive overhaul of the global economic system, in which distributed ledger technology will play a foundational role. Further tying his predictions, Remi highlights developments that are connected to broader political changes. In a March 6 post, Remi cited a tweet from Whale Insider reporting that Congressman Thomas Massie had reintroduced a bill to abolish the Federal Reserve. In Remi’s view, this political move aligns with the transition to a digital asset-based financial order, one led by the so-called “Fantastic Four”: XRP, XLM, XDC, and HBAR. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 FedNow, DTCC, and SWIFT: Infrastructure Realignment According to Remi, these assets are already linked to key infrastructure systems. He claims that the Federal Reserve’s FedNow program is backed by XRP, XLM, and HBAR, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is aligned with XRP, XLM, and XDC, and SWIFT uses XRP, XDC, HBAR, and LINK. He also asserted that XRP, XLM, and HBAR will support the new reserve framework, with XRP and XLM already hosting native stablecoins and HBAR’s stablecoin expected soon. In a post dated May 30, 2025, Remi pointed to what he described as confirmation from the Federal Reserve regarding the use of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) as a key consensus mechanism. He claimed that this “Go Sign” from the Fed validates the security and scalability of the BFT model and specifically credited XRP, XLM, and HBAR as the assets employing it. “Been screaming it since January,” he wrote, stating that followers who acted on his guidance are about to see significant returns. Final Warnings and Cold Wallet Endorsements His concluding remarks encourage self-custody of digital assets, with specific endorsements of cold wallets, such as Tangem, which he notes directly support HBAR and XDC. He advised followers to get their assets—especially XRP and XLM —off exchanges, stressing that “it doesn’t look like it right now…but you have NO CLUE how much money you’re holding in your portfolio.” The message ends with Remi saying that “everyone is in for a jaw-dropping surprise,” reinforcing his belief in the transformative value of these assets. While Remi Relief’s predictions are speculative and not grounded in official confirmations from the Federal Reserve or any regulatory body, his posts continue to attract attention within the digital asset community. His interpretation of symbolic connections, institutional alignment, and political developments forms the foundation of a narrative in which XRP and its peer assets play a central role in a restructured financial order.

At the same time, a new sports-themed meme coin has burst onto the scene, promising an even more dramatic rise—potentially up to 7000%. Could this emerging token outperform XRP's expected gains? The article explores these exciting developments and what they could mean for investors. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Ripple (XRP) Source: TradingView Over the past week, XRP experienced a slight decline of 0.69%. The monthly performance shows a more noticeable drop of 7.73%, and over the past six months, the price has decreased by 2.83%. These downward trends suggest that XRP has been under selling pressure recently. Currently trading between $2.06 and $2.31, XRP is nearing its nearest resistance level at $2.45. If the price breaks above this point, it could target the second resistance at $2.70, indicating potential growth. This would represent an increase of around 17% from the current lower range. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $1.94, with a second support at $1.69. A drop to the second support would mean a decrease of about 18% from the current upper range. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.16, slightly below the 100-day SMA of $2.19, hinting at a short-term bearish trend. However, the Relative Strength Index stands at 57.37, which is in neutral territory but leaning toward bullish momentum. The Stochastic oscillator reading of 59.03 supports this view. The MACD level at 0.00005288 suggests minimal momentum. Based on these factors, XRP could see moderate growth if it surpasses the resistance levels. Conclusion While XRP's bull run is anticipated, XYZVerse (XYZ) could deliver even greater gains, aiming for 20,000% growth and uniting sports fans in a unique crypto ecosystem.

Meanwhile, a new contender in the meme coin arena, focused on sports, is causing a stir with its audacious claim of a possible 7000% surge. Could this newbie overshadow XRP’s anticipated gains? The Rising Star: Sports Meme Coin The meme coin market has recently been invigorated by the arrival of a sports-themed coin, captivating investors with its high-energy branding and massive growth potential. This coin is not just another addition to the crypto game; it's a potential game-changer with its smart use of viral marketing and community engagement to propel its value. This new coin's strategy includes leveraging partnerships with sports influencers and adopting deflationary tactics to enhance its value over time. As it stands, the coin’s presale price is remarkably low, making it an attractive buy for speculative investors who are banking on its success to replicate or exceed the rallies seen by its predecessors like Doge and Shiba Inu.

XRP: A Stalwart in the Crypto Market XRP has been a key player in the cryptocurrency world for years, known for its fast transaction times and low fees.

The unexpected geopolitical development triggered widespread panic across financial markets, with altcoins taking the hardest hit. Solana, in particular, has seen significant selling pressure, dropping 20% from its May high of approximately $185 and now trading near $148. Related Reading: Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom – All Eyes On Next Move This breakdown confirms investor concerns that SOL’s uptrend has weakened. Top analyst Carl Runefelt noted that Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern—a bearish technical structure often signaling deeper downside. The price has broken below the neckline of this pattern, confirming the potential for continued declines in the short term. Adding to the bearish outlook is Solana’s inability to reclaim its prior support levels during brief bounces. With momentum indicators turning negative and broader market sentiment rattled, the likelihood of a swift recovery appears slim unless macro conditions stabilize. Solana Faces Deeper Correction As Bearish Pattern Unfolds Solana’s bullish momentum from late 2024 has all but faded, replaced by stagnation and sharp corrections as market conditions worsen. Now trading more than 50% below its all-time high, SOL continues to struggle under the weight of global macroeconomic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions. The US military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities has only added to the volatility, sending shockwaves through both traditional and crypto markets. While Solana was one of the strongest performers during the previous cycle, its price action has turned decisively bearish in recent weeks. Bulls have failed to maintain critical support levels, and the asset has now broken below its short-term trend structures. According to Runefelt, Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders pattern, a classic technical signal that often precedes a prolonged downtrend. The pattern’s neckline has been breached, and the projected bearish target now stands around $106.30—a level not seen since February. The breakdown also reflects broader weakness in the altcoin market. Despite earlier hopes for an altseason, capital has rotated out of risk assets, favoring Bitcoin and stablecoins amid uncertainty. Solana’s inability to reclaim prior highs or establish higher lows points to a market in retreat. Momentum indicators continue to flash red, and unless bulls reclaim lost ground quickly, SOL could be facing an extended period of consolidation or further losses. Related Reading: Tron Energy Usage Surges 108% – Smart Contract Activity Accelerates SOL Price Analysis: Breaking Below Key Support Solana is under pressure as it breaks below the critical 200-day simple moving average (SMA) around $149.54, a level that had previously acted as dynamic support. This breakdown signals growing bearish sentiment as price action confirms a loss of momentum following weeks of consolidation below the $155–$160 resistance zone. As of now, SOL is trading at approximately $135.99, down nearly 3% on the day and over 20% from its May highs. The chart shows a rejection near the 100-day SMA (green line), and the sustained move below both the 200-day and 50-day SMAs (blue line) points to a shifting structure, leaning heavily toward the downside. Volume remains elevated on red candles, confirming that the breakdown is supported by increasing sell pressure rather than a low-liquidity move. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason If the current trend continues, Solana could revisit the $120–$125 range, which previously served as strong support in early Q1 2025. The broader context of macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tension, particularly the recent U.S. attack on Iran, adds to investor unease across risk assets, including altcoins like Solana. A daily close back above $149 would be needed to neutralize the short-term bearish structure and shift sentiment. Until then, downside risks dominate.

A recent post by FinanceBro (@FinanceBroYT), a crypto analyst on X, highlights eight global banks that use XRP for certain transactions, with their combined annual transaction volumes exceeding $7 trillion. FinanceBro called out everyone underestimating XRP’s utility and claiming it has no real use case, believing that institutions as big as these would not adopt an asset without the potential to improve the global financial market. MUST SEE: HERE IS THE DATA ON THE TOP 8 BANKS CURRENTLY USING #XRP !!! YES THEY DO $7 TRILLION IN TRANSACTIONS!! pic.twitter.com/FcpT0qxNod — FinanceBro (@FinanceBroYT) June 21, 2025 XRP’s Integration Into the Global Banking System According to the video, Shinhan Bank and Woori Bank each process $1.8 trillion annually. Bank of America follows with $1.1 trillion. Others include SBI Holdings with $870 billion, Santander with $760 billion, American Express at $665 billion, Standard Chartered handling $630 billion, and PNC with $485 billion. A crypto expert recently listed Bank of America and Santander as crucial partnerships that could send XRP to the stratosphere . These banks use XRP in certain capacities, and its exposure to this large volume has excited the community. Bank of America Using XRP Internally Ripple offers a global payment solution for banks through XRP, and its partnership with Bank of America and other banks highlighted in the video could contribute greatly to widespread adoption. FinanceBro referenced previous reports that Bank of America is using XRP for internal transactions . These indicate a shift toward using XRP for payment processing among U.S. financial institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Although the full extent of XRP’s use within these banks isn’t public, FinanceBro and many others see their adoption of the asset as evidence of broader institutional adoption. Implications for XRP’s Role in Global Finance If XRP’s adoption increases among institutions like these, the long-term implications could be significant. FinanceBro suggests that the asset’s presence in global banking infrastructure is growing steadily. He estimates that if the transaction volumes of these banks eventually translate to XRP Ledger usage at scale, XRP’s market cap could rise substantially. Based on his calculations, a full $7 trillion adoption could theoretically push the asset to $124.6, though he notes this as a long-term projection. Ripple has secured multiple licenses to enable increased adoption by banks. With over $7 trillion flowing through these banks, XRP is in the middle of a gold mine, and its growing influence within these institutions could unlock more volume for the asset.

According to reports, the Cyber Crime team of the Uttar Pradesh police arrested 10 individuals from different locations, including Lucknow, Raebareli, and Gonda. In their report , the police mentioned that the arrested individuals were laundering funds on behalf of a Chinese cyber fraud gang by converting the illegal proceeds into different digital assets. The Indian police initiated the arrests after concluding its investigations into digital fraud operations with international connections. This was mainly due to the rise of fraud operations and other illicit activities involving the digital industry. For instance, there has been a rise in the number of investment scams related to digital assets in the country in the last few months. Indian police apprehend suspects for laundering criminal proceeds The officials stated that the suspects were part of a big network of criminals that aided the operations of the Chinese gang in the country. While there are indications that the network is spread globally, the Indian police were only focused on smashing their network in the country. Reports claim that the Chinese gang carried out different sorts of online scams, routing the illegal funds through multiple bank accounts. The authorities mentioned that these arrested individuals worked for the gang , using their local bank accounts to receive the funds. After receiving the funds, the suspects then uses it to purchase digital assets and transfer them back to the criminal gang after deducting their commission. According to investigations, over the last two months, the arrested suspects had made payments of nearly Rs. 75 to 80 lakh (approximately $86k to $92k). Among the ten suspects taken into custody by the Indian police, two have agreed to help the authorities by becoming government witnesses. The remaining individuals have been booked and sent to judicial custody pending trial. The authorities said that all of them were involved in helping the Chinese gang coordinate things on the ground. They carried out activities like acquiring bank accounts, managing digital transactions, and making profits via commission on each transfer. This case highlights a growing trend in the country, with authorities initiating an arrest of two men, including an industrialist from Hyderabad last week. According to authorities, the men were receiving funds said to be proceeds of scams in their bank accounts. Investigations discovered that the funds were sent to a casino in Sri Lanka which is currently under investigation for cyber fraud. The police approached the victim after a tip-off from their counterpart. The victim had already made payments to the Indian accounts provided by the criminals. Authorities have warned residents in the country to be watchful of criminal elements like these. The authorities stated that those trying to steal people’s hard-earned money often come with great investment opportunities that are always too good to be true. They offer very high amounts of returns on investment , pushing victims to take advantage of it in a short while. While the first few investment opportunities are always impressive, they use them to deceive their victims into making more investments, which are then stolen and laundered.

While some tokens are seeing declines despite positive news or partnerships, others are gaining momentum as they attract new investors. ONDO, for example, has come under selling pressure even after a major alliance announcement, while newer projects like XYZVerse continue to build interest during their early stages. Ondo Finance Launches Global Alliance for Tokenized Assets Ondo Finance is a leading platform focused on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), offering on-chain exposure to U.S. Treasuries and other securities. Recently, it announced the launch of the Global Markets Alliance—a coalition of major players like Solana Foundation, Trust Wallet, BitGo, and 1inch. The goal is to create common standards for RWAs and expand access to tokenized securities for global investors. ONDO Price Drops 10% Despite Positive News Despite these positive developments, ONDO, the native token of Ondo Finance, experienced a sharp correction on June 17, dropping by approximately 10% from $0.86 to $0.77. At the time of writing, ONDO is trading at $0.7759. Over the past week, ONDO’s price has fluctuated between $0.7316 and $0.8390, while the past 24 hours saw a range of $0.7574 to $0.7817. ONDO Technical Price Analysis The current trend for ONDO is sideways with signs of mild recovery. Momentum indicators, such as the RSI, suggest a neutral to slightly bullish stance, with readings hovering near 50-55. However, trading volume has notably decreased by approximately 52% since the last surge, indicating lower current market participation. Key resistance levels are identified at $0.82 and $0.86, while immediate support lies around $0.73, with a stronger long-term support level near $0.71. ONDO Price Outlook: Short-Term Consolidation Ahead In the short term, ONDO is expected to consolidate within the $0.75 to $0.82 range. Should the broader market sentiment improve or Bitcoin rally, ONDO could attempt another test towards the $0.85 level. Conversely, if bearish pressure persists, traders should monitor the $0.73 support level for potential retests. Following last week’s 10% correction, ONDO appears to be stabilizing. The short-term outlook remains neutral, with no clear breakout signals at this time. Volume recovery will be a key factor to watch going forward. Why Did ONDO Fall? Market Reactions and Long-Term View Despite the strategic alliance, ONDO’s price drop reflects common market dynamics: a sell-the-news event driven by technical weakness and broader bearish mood. The alliance still adds long-term value, but short-term performance may remain subdued until momentum picks up and resistance levels are cleared. While ONDO Faces Short-Term Challenges, XYZVerse Gains Traction While ONDO’s recent correction shows how even positive announcements can trigger mixed price action, other projects are seeing clear upward momentum. One example is XYZVerse — a fast-growing meme coin that’s combining sports culture with community-driven hype. Let’s take a closer look at its current performance and potential. XYZVerse ($XYZ) is positioning itself as the first all-sports meme coin — blending sports culture with the viral energy of meme coins. The project has already raised over $14 million in its presale, as announced on its official X profile. This reflects growing market interest in meme coins that offer more than just short-term hype. What Sets XYZVerse Apart? Unlike many meme tokens that rely on fleeting trends, XYZVerse is built with strong community engagement in mind: Revenue Mechanics: Regular buybacks and token burns, helping to support price stability. Gamified Features: A roadmap that includes play-to-earn mechanics, sports-themed mini-games, and platform utilities. Strong Branding: The project’s new mascot, XYZepe, helps establish a clear identity aimed at building long-term community loyalty. Join XYZVerse Presale Now Presale Update: Limited Stages Remaining The presale is moving quickly — nearly 95% of Stage 12 is sold out, with only three stages left before public launch. Here’s a look at current pricing: Stage Price per $XYZ Current Stage 12 $0.003333 Next Stage $0.005 Final Presale Price $0.01 At current levels, early supporters could see potential returns of up to 3000% if the project meets its growth targets after launch. Final Thoughts In a market where many altcoins struggle to hold attention, XYZVerse is building steadily — with strong presale results, clear branding, and a community-driven approach. As ONDO looks for a recovery and other meme coins face uncertainty, XYZVerse is quickly emerging as one of the more promising new projects in 2025.

Unpacking ONDO's Unexpected Market Response In a surprising turn of events, ONDO's value plummeted by 10% in spite of forming a major Global Markets Alliance. Ondo Finance, a pioneer in tokenized real-world assets, recently initiated this alliance with heavyweights like Solana Foundation and Trust Wallet, aiming to standardize and broaden access to tokenized securities worldwide. Despite these high expectations, the market's reaction was lukewarm, leading to a significant price drop for ONDO from $0.86 to $0.77. Currently, ONDO trades at $0.7759, with recent activities showing a trading range that suggests a cautious market sentiment. Technical Analysis and Future Prospects for ONDO ONDO's market behavior shows a sideways trend with potential for mild recovery. The resistance and support levels identified at $0.82 and $0.73 respectively could play crucial roles in the upcoming weeks. The decrease in trading volume by about 52% since the last peak also hints at reduced market participation. Looking forward, if ONDO can stabilize and start to climb back towards key resistance levels, there might be an opportunity for a bullish reversal, especially if influenced by broader market improvements or a Bitcoin rally. Rise of XYZVerse: A New Contender in Crypto In contrast to ONDO, XYZVerse appears to be on an upward trajectory, having successfully raised over $14 million during its presale phases. The project, which merges sports culture with meme coin appeal, seems to capture both community interest and investment. XYZVerse is carving a niche for itself by introducing innovative features such as revenue mechanics including token buybacks and burns, alongside a gamified ecosystem offering play-to-earn experiences and sports-themed mini-games. Current Stage and Expectations The presale for XYZVerse is advancing rapidly, with nearly all tokens for Stage 12 already sold and only a few stages left at discounted rates. Stage Price per $XYZ Current Stage 12 $0.003333 Next Stage $0.005 Final Presale Price $0.01 With only a few stages left, potential investors might see significant returns, possibly up to 3000%, if XYZVerse continues to meet its targets post-launch. Final Overview and Market Implications The contrasting scenarios of ONDO and XYZVerse provide a fascinating snapshot of the current altcoin market dynamics as we edge closer to 2025. While ONDO seeks to recover and stabilize, XYZVerse is quickly positioning itself as a formidable meme coin with substantial community and financial backing.

This amount is different for everyone, but financial advisors commonly suggest replacing about three-quarters of your pre-retirement income. For someone earning close to the U.S. average salary of $67,000, that would mean needing around $50,000 per year. Accumulating enough savings to meet that target varies. Several surveys provide benchmarks. One widely accepted model by Fidelity suggests saving an amount that’s roughly ten times your annual income by the time you retire. For someone earning the 2024 average U.S. salary of $67,920, this approach implies building a retirement fund of around $679,200. Northwestern Mutual’s recent study puts the average retirement goal at roughly $1.26 million. In contrast, Charles Schwab’s 2024 estimate places the ideal retirement fund closer to $1.8 million. Regardless of the figure, most people aim to build at least $1 million over time. However, these estimates reflect costs in high-income countries. In lower-cost regions, the required amount for a comfortable retirement could be far lower. Still, the $1 million milestone remains a popular aspiration due to the flexibility it can provide. How XRP Fits into the Picture For those exploring digital assets as part of their retirement strategy, XRP is often viewed as a potential high-return investment . The key question is whether a moderate investment today could grow large enough to support retirement by 2040. Holding 100,000 XRP could yield $1 million if the token reaches $10 . But such a purchase would cost over $200,000 today, which is well beyond the reach of many retail investors. More realistically, some consider holding 10,000 XRP, which would cost around $20,700 at the current price of $2.07. If the digital asset were to climb to $100 , that investment would become a seven-figure portfolio.

They estimate the token could hit $170 by early 2040 and possibly reach $1,474 by year-end. At that rate, a 10,000 XRP holding could be worth more than $14 million. If that upper-end prediction came true, even a smaller position could be enough. For example, 700 XRP, currently valued near $1,500, would cross the $1 million mark at $1,474 per token. Experts believe holding just 10,000 XRP will soon be impossible for most retail investors, and getting in early could be a life-changing decision when 2040 comes and the price has soared to unexpected heights.

As the situation worsened, ETH dropped 5% to $2,270.86 and 6.4% in 24 hours. Trading volume surged to $21.6 billion as risk-off sentiment and volatility spiked across crypto.

Latest: https://t.co/je3LeESEFs pic.twitter.com/BFjyiJhk5X — Sky News (@SkyNews) June 22, 2025 Ethereum Breaks Below Key Support; More Downside Ahead? From a technical perspective, the Ethereum price prediction appea rs weak. The price has been forming lower highs capped by a descending trendline from the $2,900 high. This trendline has been rejecting all the bullish attempts and shows bearish control. The break below $2,378 horizontal support is significant. This level was a floor through most of May and early June and has now become resistance. The three black crows candlestick pattern is a bearish reversal pattern, indicating further selling. ETH is also below the 50-period EMA at $2,493. This EMA is dynamic resistance in a downtrend, confirming the bearish setup. Moreover, the MACD is showing a widening gap between the MACD and signal lines (-20.18 vs -41.31) and a declining histogram. A bearish MACD divergence was visible before the drop as momentum faded even as ETH tried to hold above $2,400. Trade and Levels to Watch With $2,378 now resistance, ETH traders should look for a bearish retest of that level. If the price attempts to reclaim this zone but fails, especially with bearish candlesticks such as a spinning top or a bearish engulfing pattern, it will create a low-risk short setup. Trade Setup: Entry Range: $2,370–$2,378 on a confirmed rejection Stop-Loss: Above $2,400 to avoid false breakouts Target 1: $2,114 – A strong historical support zone Target 2: $2,036 – Deeper demand level last tested in April Also, watch for RSI divergence or reversal candles at $2,114 to see if the downtrend is exhausted. In summary, the recent sell off is a mix of geopolitical and technical. Until ETH reclaims the 50 EMA and breaks above the trendline, the path of least resistance is down. Be cautious and wait for confirmation at key levels before entering.

Meanwhile, an emerging sports-themed meme coin is drawing attention with the potential for an astonishing 7,000% rise. This newcomer could potentially outperform established cryptocurrencies, raising curiosity about which digital asset will lead the market's next big upswing. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges XRP: The Cryptocurrency Aiming to Revolutionize Global Payments XRP is a digital currency designed to make global money transfers fast and affordable. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized system without a central authority, ensuring secure and irreversible transactions. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that received 80 billion XRP, uses it to improve liquidity and support the ecosystem. With XRP, moving money across borders becomes as easy as sending an email, without the need for a bank account. In today's market, XRP stands out for its speed and low transaction costs. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that can be slow and expensive, XRP offers quick settlements, making it attractive for businesses and individuals alike. Its resistance to censorship and openness add to its appeal. As the demand for faster and more efficient payment methods grows, XRP's technology positions it as a strong contender in the cryptocurrency space. While market trends can be unpredictable, XRP's focus on solving real-world problems gives it potential to thrive in the evolving financial landscape. Conclusion XRP and other coins show strong potential in the current bull run, but XYZVerse (XYZ) may surpass them with its unique sports-meme ecosystem and massive growth prospects.

Key Takeaways: Texas has become the first US state to launch a publicly funded, standalone Bitcoin reserve. Other states like Florida and Arizona have backed away from similar efforts. The move follows President Trump’s executive order to establish a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law on Saturday, establishing a state-funded Bitcoin reserve, the first of its kind in the country. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. Texas Taps Comptroller to Oversee New Bitcoin Fund The fund will be overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar and aims to explore Bitcoin as a strategic asset class. “We can buy land, we can buy gold; I think the state of Texas should have the option of evaluating the best performing asset over the last 10 years,” said bill author Senator Charles Schwertner earlier this year. A companion bill, HB 4488, further shields the Bitcoin reserve from being raided during the state’s routine fund reallocations and secures its legal status regardless of when, or if, Bitcoin is purchased. JUST IN: Texas Governor Greg Abbott signs Bitcoin Reserve bill SB 21 into law. Texas is now the third state with a Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/2JJOc7anf4 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 21, 2025 Despite its potentially far-reaching implications, the initiative was left out of the governor’s list of top legislative priorities. Texas’ move comes as some US states abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In May, Florida became the latest to drop crypto legislation , joining other states, including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma. Likewise, Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. She called digital assets “untested investments,” effectively stopping the proposed Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Act in its tracks. The hesitance to embrace BTC comes amid concerns over its price volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Public Companies Embrace Bitcoin as Strategic Investment Meanwhile, public firms continue to embrace Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

Gone are the days of pure “hype-coins” without substantial development updates or long-term value propositions. Furthermore, the influx of countless copycat tokens has diluted PEPE’s original brand appeal. This shift has created ample room for innovative, young projects like Neo Pepe, whose structured approach and compelling narrative distinguish it as the best Pepe coin available. Investors now gravitate toward projects offering more than surface-level entertainment, seeking genuine participation in decentralized community governance. Rise of Neo Pepe as Crypto’s Premier Meme Coin Frog-themed cryptocurrencies have consistently held their quirky but significant place within the meme coin ecosystem, historically championed by tokens like PEPE. In 2025, however, investor sentiment is rapidly evolving—and Neo Pepe ($NEOP) has surged to prominence as the top Pepe coin in the market. Distinguished by its clear anti-centralization ethos and structured roadmap, Neo Pepe resonates deeply with investors seeking cultural relevance paired with genuine project integrity. The best crypto presale currently ongoing, Neo Pepe’s presale is now in Stage 4 and has impressively surpassed $1.3 million raised, with tokens priced attractively at $0.08. This impressive momentum underscores rising investor confidence.

Simply put, if you’re serious about meme coins, you might want to get a little Neo Pepe. How Neo Pepe Coin Became Top Frog-Themed Cryptocurrency Neo Pepe’s ascent as the new market favorite owes heavily to its intentional positioning as a powerful cultural statement. It encapsulates crypto’s core values of decentralization and resistance against overly regulated financial environments, resonating strongly with ideologically motivated investors. The project is rooted in transparency and community engagement, sharply contrasting the shallow mechanics of earlier meme coins. A core attraction of Neo Pepe is its decentralized structure—no developer-controlled wallets exist, ensuring every allocation is governed democratically by its DAO. This structural integrity appeals profoundly to investors prioritizing security and accountability. Amid the crowded landscape of frog-themed meme coins, Neo Pepe has distinguished itself with both an impactful message and a robust operational model. $NEOP Climbs to Top of Meme Coin Mountain As meme coin enthusiasm returns with vigor, Neo Pepe is swiftly ascending informal investor rankings on forums, dashboards, and tracking platforms. Unlike previous coins reliant on short-lived excitement, Neo Pepe demonstrates measurable traction through intentional strategy and grassroots community engagement. Investors are drawn not merely by price action, but by the psychologically rewarding experience of active participation. Legacy meme coins remain trapped in static narratives, whereas Neo Pepe continually adapts and evolves, offering a uniquely interactive investment journey underpinned by clearly defined frameworks. Explore Crypto Volt’s newest video breaking down the Neo Pepe Presale, offering sharp insights into why $NEOP is capturing serious attention from crypto investors. Key Reasons Neo Pepe Leads as Crypto’s Best Pepe Coin Structured Presale : Neo Pepe’s presale unfolds over 16 stages with escalating token values, promoting early investment through progressively rewarding participation.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May. At the start of June, Tron is trending near the $0.270 range, maintaining its price above $0.268.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-22 08:30:00

The latest leg lower coincides with an intensifying geopolitical crisis in the Middle East. After President Donald Trump confirmed U.S. airstrikes on Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan nuclear facilities, calling the operation a “spectacular military success”, XRP’s downward momentum accelerated.

Global tension just became market chaos. pic.twitter.com/rBrZKiZtxm — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) June 22, 2025 At the time of writing, XRP is trading near $2.07, with a 24-hour drop of 2.92% and a trading volume exceeding $3 billion. The broader market has also been rattled, but XRP’s move has been particularly pronounced, hitting a weekly low near $2.00, as investor risk appetite evaporated. Iran’s response, including missile launches and diplomatic condemnation at the U.N., raised fears of a wider war, prompting a risk-off reaction across crypto and equity markets. What Israel wants, Israel gets I guess. The US is now directly involved in Israel-Iran war. pic.twitter.com/DUrE3ywlSo — Darth D.O.G.E (@darth__doge) June 22, 2025 Investor flight from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies intensified after Iran’s foreign minister warned of “everlasting consequences,” while the country’s U.N. envoy described the strikes as “heinous and illegal.” As markets brace for further escalation, the pressure on XRP remains heavy. Market Turns Defensive Amid Escalating Conflict XRP’s bearish movement is closely tied to the broader shift in the market sentiment, which is increasingly defensive. Moreover, concerns over oil supply disruptions, military conflict near global shipping routes, and potential retaliatory strikes on U.S. and Israeli assets have sent investors toward safer havens. The deployment of U.S. B-2 bombers to Guam, the closure of Israeli airspace, and alerts at regional military bases further worsened the risk climate. Official: No Signs of nuclear contamination detected around attacked nuclear sites https://t.co/fB4xFMiLv0 pic.twitter.com/uMAfVkjeqX — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) June 22, 2025 Although Iranian authorities confirmed that no radioactive contamination resulted from the attacks, the psychological impact has been significant. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned the situation could “rapidly get out of control,” emphasizing the risk of broader destabilization. In response, speculative markets, such as cryptocurrency, have seen sharp outflows. XRP’s market cap has now fallen to approximately $121.9 billion, placing it fourth among all cryptocurrencies by value. The weekly performance has declined by more than 4%, and with high volatility, a further breakdown seems plausible unless geopolitical headlines ease. Key reasons behind the bearish investor behavior include: Heightened geopolitical risk from the U.S.-Iran-Israel conflict Broader market rotation out of speculative assets Market uncertainty over further U.S. military intervention Lack of institutional buying amid prolonged sell-off Unless diplomatic intervention provides clarity, this environment is likely to keep XRP under pressure. XRP Technical Signals Point to Further Weakness On the chart, the technical structure reinforces the bearish XRP price prediction . The price is currently capped below the descending trendline extending from the $2.30 local high. This downtrend has consistently rejected bullish attempts, and recent price action reflects a bearish retest of broken support at $2.0870, now acting as fresh resistance. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Adding to the confluence is the 50-period EMA, currently sloping downward near $2.1278. Price failed to reclaim this level, confirming the bearish trend. A spinning top candle formed at resistance within the supply zone, signaling indecision and potential reversal—a common precursor to downside continuation. Momentum indicators offer no optimism. The MACD histogram remains marginally negative, and both the MACD and signal lines are below zero. Importantly, no bullish divergence is present, suggesting momentum still favors sellers. XRP Potential Trade Setup: This setup presents a potential shorting opportunity for traders waiting on confirmation: Entry: Below $2.07, upon rejection of the $2.0870–$2.1170 resistance band Stop-Loss: Above $2.12, to account for false breakouts Target 1: $2.0186 – Prior bounce zone Target 2: $1.9852 – Key support and psychological barrier In conclusion, both macroeconomic and technical conditions indicate continued XRP weakness. With geopolitical tensions still escalating and buyers showing no strength, XRP may not find meaningful support until it retests the psychological $2.00 level or possibly lower if conflict expands.

This morning, Ethereum lost 7.7 percent of its value, falling to $2,200, while Bitcoin remained largely stable. Ethereum Price Dropped More Than Most Smaller Altcoins ETH recouped some of its losses during the day, reaching its lowest intraday price since May 9. The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, briefly saw $101,000 before trading close to its previous levels. Since traditional financial markets were closed over the weekend, cryptocurrencies were the first to react to the developments. “The market is watching geopolitical developments with concern,” said Caroline Moron, co-founder of crypto derivatives market liquidity provider Orbit Markets, noting that investors are keeping a close eye on levels of $100,000 for Bitcoin and $2,000 for Ethereum. Moron said oil prices will also be on the agenda when traditional markets reopen. Related News: Developers of Major Memecoin Transfer Their Holdings to Binance: They May Have Sold Uncertainty in the markets reached its peak when Trump announced that Iran’s facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan were hit. Trump, who stated that a “bomb-laden attack” was carried out on the Fordow facility in particular, stated that this facility was being closely monitored by the international community on suspicion of nuclear weapons production due to its uranium enrichment activities. “Uncertainty over whether the US will attack Iran has been creating selling pressure throughout the week,” said Cosmo Jiang, general partner at Pantera Capital Management. “However, confirmation of the attacks and the imminent resolution have led prices to find a local bottom.” According to Coinglass data, a total of $679 million worth of positions were liquidated in the crypto market in the last 24 hours. $554 million of this figure consisted of long positions and $67 million consisted of short positions. Jiang also noted that during times of geopolitical uncertainty, “Bitcoin usually leads the recovery.” *This is not investment advice.

Liim’s post comes at a time when market participants are once again evaluating the long-term value proposition of XRP. Liim calculated that if XRP were to reach $10, Ripple’s escrow holdings would be valued at $362.08 billion. He also projected that Chris Larsen’s XRP holdings would surge to $26.43 billion. He noted that while Ripple did not create XRP, large amounts of the token were distributed to the company and its founders in its early stages. If $XRP Hits $10, Chris Larsen Holdings Would Surge to $26.43 billion, and Ripple Escrow Will Be Worth $362.08 billion. Check Thread pic.twitter.com/zkLIQxMEXF — Abraham Liim (@AbrahamArmy) June 21, 2025 Ripple’s Escrow Strategy Ripple committed in 2017 to locking up the majority of its XRP in escrow, setting up monthly releases of 1 billion XRP to provide market transparency and prevent sudden surges in available supply. Through this structured approach, Ripple retains control of the largest portion of XRP, giving the company significant exposure to any future price increase. Liim emphasized this fact, noting that both Ripple and Larsen could benefit tremendously if XRP appreciates significantly. By December 2024, Larsen’s net worth had surged by almost $6 billion , due to XRP’s growth after Donald Trump’s election victory. The asset’s price kept climbing until January, adding more to the co-founder’s net worth, and Liim expects a similar situation to play out soon. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Analysts Expect Significant Growth Liim cited analyst DK64Trades, who recently suggested that XRP could break above $10 in the current market cycle . This assessment was based on technical signals from the XRP dominance chart, which measures XRP’s market share relative to the rest of the crypto market. According to Liim’s data, XRP has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. Of that, 63.76 billion XRP are in circulation, with another 36.2 billion locked in escrow. Positive News for Ripple and Chris Larsen Liim’s summary highlighted the massive value shift that could occur with a price rise to $10. He estimated that Ripple’s escrow would grow in value by $285 billion and Chris Larsen’s holdings by $20 billion compared to current valuations. This discussion comes amid growing attention on XRP’s institutional role and its long-term viability as a global reserve currency . The token’s utility in cross-border payments and Ripple’s enterprise-focused adoption strategy all contribute to its appeal, making the $10 prediction feasible. Whether or not XRP reaches the $10 mark, the potential upside for Ripple and Larsen remains considerable, given their substantial stake in the asset.

As global tech leaders continue to debate the impact of the technology on the job market, the Mistral AI boss says the biggest skill to humans might be “deskilling.” In a recent interview , the Mistral AI boss dismissed claims that artificial intelligence will lead to more cuts to white-collar jobs. Another claim was made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who said that AI could be on its way to eliminating 50% of entry-level office jobs. Amodei mentioned that as producers of the technology, AI firms and labs need to be honest about what is coming. He added that unemployment could increase by 10% to 20% in the next five years. Mistral AI CEO reveals AI’s threat to humans Mensch dismissed the idea that artificial intelligence could run up the unemployment rate in the future. He said the bigger risk is that people might become lazier as they rely on the technology to search for information. The CEO, who co-founded the open-source large language model developer alongside Guillaume Sample and Timothy Lacroix in April 2023, mentioned that a way to avoid this is to ensure that humans remain actively involved in reviewing and critiquing artificial intelligence outputs. He added that developers can avoid the risk if they look at it from a design aspect. “It’s a risk that you can avoid, if you think of it from a design perspective, if you make sure that you have the right human input, that you keep the human active,” he said. The Mistral AI CEO, who spoke at the Viva tech conference in Paris this month also added that it is important that humans do not see every output from artificial intelligence models as the truth. The Mistral boss said that if people continue to be interested in learning, being able to process and criticize information is one of the most important components of learning. Mensch, who was a former Google DeepMind researcher also responded to a recent statement from Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger, who stated that AI is impacting entry-level engineering roles in the industry, even at AI firms. He added that Anthropic is focused on hiring experienced engineers, noting his hesitation with some entry-level workers. Krieger mentioned that software engineers could see their jobs change in the next three years as coders are now outsourcing more of their work to humans. He added that humans will focus on “coming up with the right ideas, doing the right user interaction design, figuring out how to delegate work correctly, and then figuring out how to review things at scale — and that’s probably some combination of maybe a comeback of some static analysis or maybe AI-driven analysis tools of what was actually produced.” Mensch also discussed Amodei’s assertion that AI could replace half of the entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, noting that the Anthropic CEO liked to spread fear about AI as a marketing tactic. He said the assertion was an overstatement and he doesn’t see it happening in the next five years. Instead, Mensch said he thought AI could change white-collar jobs moving forward. “I do expect that we’ll have more relational tasks because that’s not something you can easily replace,” he said.

The token fell from a high of $0.586 to a low of $0.5464, with the steepest drop occurring during the 21:00 hour when ADA fell 3.2% on 126 million volume, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. 24-hour trading volume climbed to 37.37% above its 30-day average. Despite this volatility, Cardano continues to attract long-term interest. Nearly $1 billion worth of ADA has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges in 2024, and over 310 million tokens have been accumulated by large holders in June alone. Institutional interest in the Cardano ecosystem was also underscored this week by the launch of a new proof-of-concept initiative involving decentralized storage platform Iagon, legal tech firm Cloud Court, and Ford Motor Company. The pilot project aims to test the viability of combining Cardano’s blockchain infrastructure with Iagon’s decentralized cloud storage to support secure legal data management systems. Ford is contributing to the project in an advisory role, drawing on its internal experience managing large-scale legal data operations. The initiative is designed to explore how a hybrid architecture—where sensitive legal documents are encrypted and stored off-chain, and access logs and verification are handled on-chain—might address long-standing issues like fragmented records, inefficient collaboration, and lack of auditability. The project also reflects Cardano’s expanding presence in enterprise environments, with potential applications extending to sectors such as healthcare, finance, and public administration. Technical Analysis Highlights ADA declined 7.0% from $0.586 to $0.545 during the analysis window, forming a $0.041 range. The steepest intraday move occurred during the analysis window, marked by a 3.2% hourly decline and elevated volume. A high-volume resistance level formed at $0.569, while support was tested at $0.545. Recovery attempts during the 23:00 and 00:00 hours failed to break resistance, despite volume exceeding 60 million ADA. A descending channel with lower highs and lower lows confirmed the bearish structure. Between 06:05 and 06:38, price entered a bullish channel with a sequence of higher lows and higher highs. Resistance emerged at $0.558, and a support zone developed around $0.554. Volume peaked at 2.3 million ADA during the 06:16 candle, supporting a temporary upward move. A modest pullback from $0.558 to $0.556 followed, representing typical post-rally consolidation. Volume declined during the pullback, suggesting weakening selling momentum.

In this type of scam that has emerged recently, malicious people impersonate official institutions and make posts that give the impression of an “official giveaway” on the X platform. These posts claim that popular hardware wallets like Ledger are being distributed for free. To increase credibility, scammers send physical devices that look really “new and sealed.” Related News: After Jerome Powell's Statements This Week, Are Altcoin Season Dreams Sinking? Analyst Explains But experts say the real danger lies in the device itself or in the “startup guide” that comes with it. These wallets could have been tampered with in advance, or users could be tricked into sharing their recovery phrases (mnemonics) through social engineering methods. SlowMist emphasized that such “free money” opportunities could actually lead users to suffer huge losses, putting millions of dollars worth of assets at risk. Therefore, wallets should only be purchased from official sources and third-party software should not be allowed in the installation process. *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview on CNBC, Lee says he’s watching for a point when the Fed could run into an “accident,” where it waits too long to address a slowing economy. Lee says he’s anticipating a potential “panic” scenario from the Fed. “There could be an accident because what we are ignoring is that housing is choking and collapsing under the weight of higher interest rates, and the labor market isn’t as strong as it appears. When we look at the ability to get a job, it’s much harder. So… there’s long and variable lags, and there could be an accident where the Fed would have to panic, so I think that’s something we have to watch in the incoming data… I think there could be a point where the Fed suddenly realizes the risks are actually to the downside for the economy weakening, and so the Fed will actually have to respond to an economy that they’re strangulating and really fighting what they believe is a supply shock inflation. So I’m a little concerned that the Fed could be late if they continue to hold.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

They are eyeing massive potential returns, particularly from memecoins. This new trend shows a preference for quirky digital assets over established projects like AVAX and Chainlink. Meanwhile, a rising star named Codename:Pepe crypto is attracting attention with promises of intelligent trading and community-driven growth. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a unique player in the crypto market. It aims to outperform fake AI projects by providing genuine insights and automated trading services. With its roots tied to the legendary PEPE coin, it offers a community-driven approach with elite features. The buzz around this project suggests a fun, potentially profitable journey for those ready to join its mission. Is Codename:Pepe the Next Top 10 Meme Coin? In a crypto space flooded with AI buzzwords, most projects fail to deliver. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents and bring real intelligence to the crypto realm. It plans to use AI to track trends, analyze data, and give traders useful insights. Codename:Pepe navigates meme coin chaos, identifying the most relevant and promising projects. Its mascot—modeled after Pepe the Frog, a beloved crypto culture icon—gives it an instant viral appeal. Combining the explosive popularity of memes with the real power of artificial intelligence, Codename:Pepe is a serious contender for the top 10 meme coin. Here are the key features of Codename:Pepe that will make it a standout meme coin soon: Scanning social media and on-chain data to find hottest trending projects Retrieving insider tips to find the most lucrative offers Generating AI-powered forecasts and reports to give investors an edge Giving access to exclusive analysis and early trading signals. Beyond its analytical capabilities, Codename:Pepe will feature a fully automated AI-trader that will execute trades based on advanced algorithms.

Holding $AGNT will unlock access to an exclusive decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)—a private club where investors can manage their portfolios, vote on strategies, and receive insider analytics. Beyond governance and staking rewards, $AGNT holders will gain access to premium AI-trading tools exclusive reports the AI-powered launchpad for launching new tokens. $AGNT tokens are currently sold for pennies. As part of the Initial Coin Offering their price is reduced greatly. Now at the twentieth stage $AGNT costs $0.023809. The project is already a half way through its 28-stage presale, with the final stage price set at $1 per token. The earlier you buy, the bigger the discount. Security-wise, Codename:Pepe isn’t playing around. This project has been audited by Pessimistic, a top-tier blockchain security firm. So while many meme coins crumble under the weight of their own hype, Codename:Pepe stands on a rock-solid foundation (of memes and math, but mostly memes). With AI-powered insights, automated trading, and a healthy dose of absurdity, Codename:Pepe claims its spot in the top 10 meme coins. Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals Avalanche (AVAX): A Scalable Ethereum Rival Making Waves in 2025 Avalanche (AVAX) has emerged as a leading Layer 1 blockchain network aiming to rival Ethereum in smart contract capabilities. Launched in 2020, Avalanche is popular among developers for its scalability and speed. It is compatible with Ethereum's Virtual Machine, allowing easy migration of smart contracts. Avalanche's key strength is its use of subnets to boost transaction throughput. The network claims to handle up to 6,500 transactions per second, far surpassing Ethereum. This scalability has attracted a growing community and positions Avalanche as a strong competitor in decentralized applications. Historically, AVAX has experienced significant growth. In the years leading up to 2025, the token saw substantial price increases, reflecting confidence in its technology. Though it faced fluctuations, AVAX has shown resilience and potential for long-term growth in the dynamic crypto market Analysts have provided optimistic long-term predictions for AVAX. Some forecasts suggest the token could continue to rise in value over the coming years, driven by strong fundamentals and adoption. While predictions vary, many believe AVAX has considerable room for growth. In the current market cycle, AVAX appears promising due to its advanced technology and scalability. Its capped supply and the burning of transaction fees contribute to its scarcity. With ongoing developments and an active community, Avalanche remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency space. Chainlink's Rise: Bridging Smart Contracts with Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized network that connects off-chain data to smart contracts through oracles. These oracles act as bridges, providing essential real-world information to blockchain applications. Without them, smart contracts can't execute properly. Chainlink uses multiple oracles to ensure there's no single point of failure, making the data secure, accurate, and always available. Since its creation in 2017, Chainlink has become a leader in the oracle space. Its native token, LINK, is used for payments within the ecosystem and for staking by node operators. As decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain solutions grow, the need for reliable off-chain data increases. This demand positions Chainlink and LINK at the heart of the evolving crypto landscape. Historically, LINK reached an all-time high of $52.88 in May 2021. While it hasn't returned to that peak yet, the expanding crypto market suggests potential for future growth. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has more than doubled since last year, signaling a market that's starting to heat up. Experts have varied predictions for LINK's future. Some believe it could surge to $40 in the near term, while long-term forecasts extend beyond $100 by 2030. These predictions reflect the optimism surrounding Chainlink's technology and its role in the blockchain ecosystem. With its robust technology and strategic position, Chainlink is poised to play a key role in the future of decentralized applications. As the demand for accurate off-chain data grows, LINK could be a significant player in the next phase of DeFi's evolution. Conclusion With the bull run in full swing, traders are shifting their focus from established coins like AVAX and Chainlink, which have less short-term potential. They are prioritizing memecoins that offer the possibility of significant returns. Among these, Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits. This innovative project uses artificial intelligence to identify lucrative meme coins, predict market trends, and provide exclusive trading signals before the hype begins. By combining smart analysis with a fully automated AI trader, Codename:Pepe crypto empowers investors to profit in the chaotic memecoin market.

Ripple (XRP) is back in the spotlight, leveraging its deep ties in cross-border payments and banking infrastructure. But the biggest attention right now surrounds Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rapidly emerging DeFi crypto that’s being hailed as one of the top tokens to buy before June ends. Presale of Mutuum Finance is in 40% sold out in Phase 5 with MUTM available for a mere $0.03. Mutuum Finance presale has attracted over 12,300 investors. More than $10.9 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be this summer’s top altcoin, with analysts floating an eye-popping 34x return potential. If you’re still asking what crypto to invest in, these two names should be at the top of your radar, before the market catches on. Revolutionizing DeFi with a Proven Dual-Lending Formula Compared to standard DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance shall be the first to attempt to establish a hybrid lending system that will be able to satisfy the needs of both passive and sophisticated users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), clients address the demands of any investor who desires to achieve passive income by putting their USDT into smart contract pools that generate stable, passive yields based on an interest rate that it adjusts upwards and downwards according to the market. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P), experienced users can take advantage of this model where both borrowers and lenders are in complete control of establishing the terms, which is ideal to handle volatile assets. The two-model design provides the maximum flexibility, control, and risk management so that a given DeFi framework can be provided compared to original traditional lending protocols. Mutuum Finance Presale Booms with 12,300+ Investors and $10.9M Raised Mutuum Finance is a DeFi protocol that is making waves in the market since it has raised more than $10.9 million and had more than 12,300 investors supporting it so far. Such a momentum is a testimony of this growing trust in the long-term project vision and the role that it would take in revolutionizing the decentralized finance market. MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03 and are currently in phase 5. As the price will be raised to $0.035 in Phase 6, current buyers will be able to make 100% of profit upon launch when the token will begin to trade for $0.06. Security First: Audited, Transparent, and Built to Last The crypto market is usually full of rug Pulls and unforeseen dangers, Mutuum Finance being the exception, with a CertiK audit. The smart contracts are all open source and auditable, which strengthens the community even more in trust and responsibility. As yet another move to create a sound financial foundation, the initiative is launching a full collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum. With mechanisms resistant to the pitfalls of depegging that affect algorithmic stable coins, the asset is meant to be stable, liquid, and capable of pursuing values that are harvestable in retail as well as institutional usage scenarios in the long term. Mutuum Finance has already achieved over $10.9 million with more than 12, 300 investors, which is an indicator of the trend of DeFi in the year 2025. Its launch price is fixed at $0.06 with a 100% gain for phase 5 buyers while some analysts peg post-launch gains at 34x. Security is also a top priority as CertiK audit and transparent smart contracts give even more credence to the project. Buy your MUTM tokens now before the next price increase comes.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading Stellar Lumens: A Bright Star in Global Payments Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a cryptocurrency designed to make international money transfers faster and cheaper. Unlike traditional methods that can be slow and expensive, XLM uses blockchain technology to enable quick, secure, and low-cost cross-border transactions. XLM acts as a bridge between the world of cryptocurrencies and traditional financial systems like banks and money transfer services. By connecting these two worlds, it helps people send money across borders more efficiently. This makes it attractive to both financial institutions and individual users. In its history, Stellar reached an all-time high price of $0.9381 on January 4, 2018. As of now, in 2025, the price is around $0.4256, which is about 54% below its peak. Over the years, the price has seen significant ups and downs, reflecting the volatility typical of cryptocurrencies. Some analysts believe that Stellar has the potential to surpass its previous highs in the future. They point to its growing adoption, partnerships with well-known companies, and positive sentiment on social media. Predictions suggest that XLM could reach $1.22 by 2030, and possibly even higher, depending on market growth and technological advancements. While there are challenges and competition from other cryptocurrencies, Stellar's focus on making transactions fast and affordable gives it a unique position in the market. Its ongoing development and collaborations could drive further acceptance and demand. As the crypto landscape evolves, Stellar Lumens may continue to shine brightly. From Collapse to Comeback: How Terra Classic (LUNC) Is Shaping 2025 Terra Classic (LUNC) has emerged as a notable force in the crypto world by 2025. Originating from the Terra blockchain, LUNC uses stablecoins tied to traditional currencies to power global payment systems. It blends the stability of fiat money with the innovation of blockchain technology. The journey began in 2018, with Terra's mainnet launching in 2019. In 2022, after a significant market event, the original Terra chain was rebranded as Terra Classic, and its token became LUNC. This shift echoed the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split, marking a new chapter for the platform. Terra Classic focuses on providing fast and affordable transactions using stablecoins pegged to currencies like the US dollar and others. It offers censorship-resistant payments, making global settlements more accessible and efficient for users worldwide. Historically, LUNC faced volatility, especially during the 2022 collapse of UST. However, over the years, it has shown resilience and recovery. By 2025, the token has stabilized, and analysts see potential for steady growth, given its strong technological foundation. In the current market cycle, Terra Classic looks attractive to both investors and users seeking stable crypto solutions. Its combination of fiat stability and blockchain speed positions LUNC as a promising player in the future of global payments. Kaspa's Rapid Rise: Is KAS the Next Big Crypto in 2025? Kaspa, launched in 2022, is a crypto newcomer catching attention. In 2023, its coin KAS grew significantly, thanks to its blockchain's ability to process 10 transactions per second and a new browser wallet. This momentum pushed KAS to new heights by late 2023 and into 2024. By August 1, 2024, KAS hit an all-time high of $0.2075. Despite some downturns, it rebounded to about $0.1485 by January 16, 2025. These movements show Kaspa's growing influence and market interest. Kaspa combines Proof-of-Work security with Proof-of-Stake speed. Its GHOSTDAG protocol recognizes simultaneous blocks, enhancing efficiency. Features like reachability and data pruning streamline transactions and support scalability. Price predictions for KAS are optimistic. Minimum forecasts suggest steady growth, while average and maximum predictions point to significant increases, possibly reaching up to $1 by 2025 and $2.50 by 2030. In the current market cycle, Kaspa's innovative approach makes it an attractive option. Its past performance and future prospects suggest KAS could be a crypto to watch. TRON (TRX): The Rising Blockchain Powerhouse of 2025 By 2025, TRON (TRX) has solidified its position as a major player in the blockchain world. As an open-source public blockchain platform supporting smart contracts, TRON offers compatibility with Ethereum, allowing developers to migrate their projects with ease. Its unique consensus mechanism delivers high transaction speeds, providing a smoother experience compared to Ethereum. TRON made headlines in 2018 with its acquisition of BitTorrent, bringing decentralized file sharing into its ecosystem. Hosting a variety of decentralized applications (DApps), TRON empowers creators to operate without the need for tech giants like Amazon and Google. This autonomy has fostered innovation and attracted a growing community of users and developers. Operating on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, TRON relies on 27 super representatives to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. TRX holders actively participate by freezing their accounts and voting for these representatives every six hours. This governance model ensures a democratic and efficient network. Historically, TRX experienced a significant surge in December 2024, nearly doubling in value to hit an all-time high of $0.4407. This growth was bolstered by strategic investments, including a $4.66 million purchase by Trump's World Liberty Financial (WLFI) decentralized finance platform in January 2025. Such developments have increased confidence in TRON's potential. Looking forward, TRON's prospects appear bright. Price predictions for 2025 estimate an average value of $0.302, with possibilities of reaching up to $0.45. By 2030, TRX could average around $0.80, potentially soaring to $1.20. With its technological strengths and expanding use cases, TRON presents an attractive opportunity in the evolving crypto market. Conclusion In summary, XLM, LUNC, KAS, and TRX are noteworthy coins that might offer growth potential, but their short-term prospects appear less promising. Market conditions suggest they may not achieve significant gains in the immediate future. On the other hand, Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by unleashing true intelligence to maximize profits. By harnessing advanced artificial intelligence, it identifies promising meme coins, predicts market trends, and delivers exclusive trading signals. This innovative approach positions Codename:Pepe crypto as a strong candidate for substantial returns.

Traders, keen on massive returns, are steering away from established coins like TRX, chasing emerging alternatives. Memecoins have captured attention, with projects like HYPE and Codename:Pepe crypto entering the spotlight. These coins promise vibrant communities and striking potential, drawing interest amid an ongoing bull run. Codename:Pepe crypto, in particular, is stirring curiosity. It condemns fake AI agents and offers genuine intelligence to navigate the meme coin landscape. By leveraging AI for predictions and automated trading, this project isn't just about laughs—it's mission-driven for extraordinary profits. With a community-powered approach, it invites investors to join its promising venture. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents—shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less.

Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited.

Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount Hyperliquid: The New Wave in Crypto Trading Hyperliquid is making waves in the crypto world. Launched in late 2024, this platform allows users to trade perpetual futures with ease. Its native coin, HYPE, supports the blockchain and uses a proof-of-stake system. This means that holders can earn more HYPE just by holding it, adding to its appeal. In just a short time, HYPE generated significant buzz. It quickly entered the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap before stabilizing around the $25 mark. This rapid rise shows strong market confidence in Hyperliquid's fundamentals and potential. What sets Hyperliquid apart is its user-friendly approach to trading. By eliminating transaction fees on perpetual futures, it attracts both new and seasoned traders. Its technology ensures a smooth experience without compromising on performance or security. Looking ahead, analysts predict promising growth for HYPE. By 2025, the average price could reach $45, with potential rallies up to $70. By 2030, long-term adoption may push the average price to $150, possibly hitting highs of $250. These projections highlight Hyperliquid's potential as a key player in the blockchain sector. In the current market cycle, HYPE appears to be an attractive option. Its strong fundamentals, innovative technology, and positive market sentiment suggest that it could continue to grow. For those interested in the future of crypto trading, Hyperliquid is definitely one to watch. TRON (TRX): The Rising Blockchain Powerhouse of 2025 By 2025, TRON (TRX) has solidified its position as a major player in the blockchain world. As an open-source public blockchain platform supporting smart contracts, TRON offers compatibility with Ethereum, allowing developers to migrate their projects with ease. Its unique consensus mechanism delivers high transaction speeds, providing a smoother experience compared to Ethereum. TRON made headlines in 2018 with its acquisition of BitTorrent, bringing decentralized file sharing into its ecosystem. Hosting a variety of decentralized applications (DApps), TRON empowers creators to operate without the need for tech giants like Amazon and Google. This autonomy has fostered innovation and attracted a growing community of users and developers. Operating on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, TRON relies on 27 super representatives to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. TRX holders actively participate by freezing their accounts and voting for these representatives every six hours. This governance model ensures a democratic and efficient network. Historically, TRX experienced a significant surge in December 2024, nearly doubling in value to hit an all-time high of $0.4407. This growth was bolstered by strategic investments, including a $4.66 million purchase by Trump's World Liberty Financial (WLFI) decentralized finance platform in January 2025. Such developments have increased confidence in TRON's potential. Looking forward, TRON's prospects appear bright. Price predictions for 2025 estimate an average value of $0.302, with possibilities of reaching up to $0.45. By 2030, TRX could average around $0.80, potentially soaring to $1.20. With its technological strengths and expanding use cases, TRON presents an attractive opportunity in the evolving crypto market. Conclusion As the market downturn concludes, traders chasing substantial returns are redirecting their attention from coins like HYPE and TRX, which show less short-term potential. There's a noticeable shift towards memecoins that promise higher gains and innovative features. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout option by offering true intelligence aimed at maximizing profits. It utilizes artificial intelligence to navigate the complex memecoin market, providing advanced trading signals and automated strategies. This community-driven project seeks to deliver significant returns, making it an appealing choice for those looking to capitalize on the current bullish trend.

These digital currencies, often inspired by internet memes and cultural icons, are not just about humor; they bring with them the promise of high returns, sometimes as much as 1000% gains, drawing in traders looking for the next big opportunity. The Advent of Codename:Pepe and Its Market Impact Among the rising stars in the memecoin sector is Codename:Pepe. It stands out not only for its engaging theme but also for its contribution to technological advancements in crypto trading.

It pledges genuine AI capabilities that help investors navigate through the volatile memecoin market with more confidence and potentially higher returns. The coin's strategy is community-driven, relying on its stakeholders to propel its value through active participation and investment in its presale. The approach is clear: attract early investors with significantly lower entry prices and maintain engagement through transparent and incremental price strategies. Join the Codename:Pepe Mission Financial Strategy and Tokenomics of Codename:Pepe Starting with an accessible entry price in its initial presale stage, Codename:Pepe gradually increases the cost, rewarding early investors. This structured pricing strategy is coupled with a capped total supply to prevent inflation and encourage steady growth. Unique Selling Points of Traditional Altcoins in the Current Market While memecoins are drawing significant attention, traditional altcoins like Hyperliquid and TRX still play a critical role in the broader digital asset ecosystem. Hyperliquid has been pioneering in simplifying trading of perpetual futures, which enhances liquidity and market stability. On the other hand, TRX continues to build on its infrastructure, improving transaction speeds and expanding its dApp ecosystem. Conclusion: The Diverse Appeal of Cryptocurrencies This current trend underscores a broader theme in the cryptocurrency market: diversity in investment choices and strategies. While the allure of memecoins like Codename:Pepe is undeniable, especially with their high-risk high-return profile, foundational assets like TRX and Hyperliquid provide stability and gradual growth, illustrating the multifaceted nature of this evolving market.

Alongside this, the plan outlines a blueprint for a won-backed stablecoin ecosystem and enhanced exchange transparency and fee disclosures. 🚨 🇰🇷 South Korea’s Financial Services Commission submits roadmap to approve spot #crypto #ETFs in H2 2025. pic.twitter.com/bmkYDJKg8m — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) June 20, 2025 This shift could open regulated on-ramps for domestic investors who, until now, have lacked safe, compliant access to digital assets. As global markets, from the U.S. to the EU, race to embrace spot ETFs and stablecoins, South Korea’s move signals that its retail-hungry crypto sector may soon see a surge of institutional-grade products, bringing new opportunities for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. South Korea Charts Course for Spot Crypto ETFs and Won Stablecoins by Late 2025 South Korea’s financial regulator has filed plans to approve spot crypto ETFs and a local stablecoin market. This signals a major policy shift, targeting late 2025 implementation. The FSC submitted its roadmap supporting President Lee's pledge to lift the crypto ETF ban. Local investors could soon access regulated spot crypto products for the first time. Developing a Korean won-backed stablecoin ecosystem is also a key goal. Officials believe this can reduce capital flight and offer safer crypto choices domestically. The FSC stressed these plans remain tentative and unconfirmed. Yet they highlight a clear government move towards broader crypto market openness. South Korea boasts a huge retail crypto market, holding $75 billion late last year. Clear rules are vital for both local and global players. Historically strict, Korea banned most crypto investment products for regular people. President Lee's team is actively changing that stance now. This push includes proposed stablecoin rules, exchange transparency, and investor safeguards. It's part of a wider pro-crypto strategy. Regulators are advancing the next phase of their digital asset framework. This covers listings, fair fees, and tougher penalties for market cheats. Global pressure mounts as the US and EU race ahead with crypto ETFs and stablecoins. Korea feels the heat to stay competitive. This roadmap is a game-changer. Korean investors have long waited for regulated access to spot crypto ETFs and stablecoins. If implemented, it will bring Korea in line with global leaders like the US and EU, according to Simon Kim (CEO of Hashed, a Korean VC). https://t.co/6cRGX0uNgJ — Simon Kim (@simonkim_nft) June 5, 2025 If the roadmap holds, spot Bitcoin ETFs could launch here late next year. This opens doors for fresh institutional and retail money. Regulators walk a tightrope balancing innovation with necessary oversight. However, the momentum for change is clearly building strong. Korea plans close work with banks to oversee ETF transactions properly. They demand clear operations, strong reviews, and good risk tools. Alongside crypto rules, the FSC may extend stock exchange hours significantly. Stricter rules for public companies are also rolling out now. This green light shows that the nations beyond the US and the UK are getting receptive to the ETF offerings. And since the crypto talk has now seeped into regulations, chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This green light shows that nations beyond the US and the UK are becoming receptive to ETF offerings. And since crypto discussions have now seeped into regulations, the chances are high for the market to make a comeback. This is a critical time for such a recovery as well, since BTC price action has not inspired much confidence lately, especially with the market reeling under the intense geopolitical backdrop involving Iran and Israel. That being said, as far as ETF news is concerned, Cryptoquant reports that there has been an influx of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which has now reached 128,000 BTC, indicating that institutional interest has been restored. This, combined with the progressive news coming from the regulatory front, could help restore market balance. Best Crypto To Buy Now With South Korea poised to open its market to spot ETFs and homegrown stablecoins, investors may soon enjoy safer, regulated routes into digital assets. These reforms could attract fresh institutional capital and boost liquidity across the board, setting the stage for a renewed bull run. For those scouting the market’s next big bets, here’s the best crypto to buy now. Solaxy With the rise of ETFs, Solaxy’s smart contract layer could become a top choice for DeFi yields once institutional capital enters Korean exchanges, making it an attractive option for risk-conscious traders. Solaxy is making a splash in June 2025 with its goal of becoming the first real Layer-2 on Solana. The platform is addressing issues like congestion, slow throughput, and developer challenges on Solana. By offering a solution that enhances dApp speed and scalability, Solaxy maintains Solana’s low-cost structure while providing a smoother experience for both developers and users. Similar to Ethereum's rollups, Solaxy bundles off-chain transactions, settling them in batches on Solana. This offloading keeps the mainnet efficient, enabling 10,000 transactions per second, with reduced fees and faster confirmations. Strong whale activity and a sharp supply reduction have made Solaxy one of the most anticipated presales of the year. Listings on major exchanges are expected soon, boosting visibility and price momentum. Renowned crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins believes Solaxy has the potential to see a 338% price increase. Due to high demand, Solaxy has extended its presale timeline, offering more investors a chance to get involved. The project remains committed to transparency, security, and sustainable growth. SUBBD South Korea’s move to approve spot crypto ETFs by late 2025 is set to boost regulated crypto investment opportunities. This could enhance adoption for utility tokens like SUBBD , which focus on AI-driven creator-fan engagement, by attracting more institutional and retail interest in innovative digital assets. SUBBD isn’t just another platform focused on profit; it transforms fan engagement into a rewarding, interactive experience. Fans gain control, unlocking premium content, exclusive livestreams, and valuable perks for participation. The $SUBBD token powers this ecosystem. Token holders can stake coins to earn platform credits, which are redeemable for tipping and exclusive rewards, enhancing their overall experience. What makes SUBBD unique is its AI-powered tools, enabling users to create lifelike media like images and videos. This interactive approach turns passive fans into active participants, driving innovation in the crypto presale space. Positioned as the leading “AI agent creator platform,” SUBBD equips creators with advanced tools, such as voice cloning and automated video production, making content creation faster and smarter. The platform supports diverse income streams, including subscriptions, NFT sales, tipping, and pay-per-view content. For $SUBBD holders, this means early access to updates, premium content, and reduced subscription costs. At the crossroads of AI, blockchain, and the creator economy, SUBBD taps into three of tech’s fastest-growing industries. These sectors aren’t just rising; they’re exploding, making SUBBD a major player in this space. BTC Bull As Bitcoin ETFs gain traction, BTC Bull is engineered to amplify every rally, poised to catch the tailwinds of Korea’s new regulatory push and deliver a turbocharged ride for momentum hunters. Bitcoin remains strong above the six-figure mark, even amid global tensions. With the safe-haven narrative around Bitcoin growing stronger, it’s becoming an attractive asset in uncertain times. For many, buying a full Bitcoin is still out of reach. BTC Bull Token offers a more affordable alternative, providing exposure to Bitcoin’s potential with built-in passive rewards and no risks tied to DeFi. Holders of BTC Bull Token earn Bitcoin rewards directly tied to Bitcoin’s price growth. This means passive income that aligns with Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation without the complexities of DeFi platforms. It doesn’t just track Bitcoin’s price; it rewards supporters by burning tokens to decrease supply and offering airdrops to generate value. BTC Bull Token unlocks Bitcoin rewards for holders at key price milestones. Starting at $150,000, each new reward tier opens at $50,000 increments, with the next rewards coming at $200,000 and $250,000. The calm before the bull run. 🐂🎯 pic.twitter.com/etsqZ58cIj — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 19, 2025 In addition to rewards, BTC Bull Token features a deflationary burn mechanism. At each $50,000 milestone, starting at $125,000, the token supply is permanently reduced through burns, mirroring Bitcoin’s own scarcity model. Conclusion South Korea's spot ETF roadmap and stablecoin strategy supported by the won indicates a tipping point in its policy for digital assets, with regulated access and more robust investor protection promised. It is not just a demonstration of the country's search for market maturity, but also indicates a trend towards institutional adoption and more transparent crypto regulation globally. For retail and professional investors alike, these trends provide a system under which to invest capital with more assurance. By targeting the best cryptocurrency to buy now that has structural strength in addition to growth potential, investors can set up their portfolio to profit from Korea's next crypto chapter.

46537212,https://timestabloid.com/?p=71746,1750586419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Toncoin (TON) Never Back Again To ATH After Listings—MUTM’s Beta Launch Set to Grab the Spotlight Next,https://timestabloid.com/toncoin-ton-never-back-again-to-ath-after-listings-mutms/,"Toncoin (TON) once dominated headlines after its listing surge, thrilling traders with a sharp rally. However, the excitement quickly wore off. Despite its strong community and ecosystem backing, Toncoin (TON) never returned to its all-time high following those listings. Like many tokens that skyrocket on hype but falter in delivery, TON showed the risks of launching without a mature product or utility-first roadmap. By contrast, a new DeFi project called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention for taking a more strategic and utility-driven path. Rather than riding the listing wave, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch its beta version before the token goes live—placing product before promotion. While hype-fueled tokens struggle to hold long-term value, utility-rich projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gaining momentum by focusing on infrastructure, passive income opportunities, and sustainable ecosystem growth. MUTM Unlocks Passive Income Through Real Lending Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol offering two powerful ways to earn income—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, users will deposit crypto assets like USDT, ETH, or BNB into smart contract-based liquidity pools. As more borrowers use these funds, interest rates will adjust dynamically, increasing returns for depositors. This creates an environment where lender earnings are driven by real borrowing activity—unlike static staking programs. The P2P model gives users full control. They will lend directly to others, set interest rates, choose duration, and even accept tokens typically ignored by centralized platforms—like PEPE, DOGE, or SHIB. This tailored lending strategy will allow active participants to potentially earn much higher yields, all while staying on-chain and in control of their funds. Every deposit will earn users mtTokens, which represent their share of the liquidity pool. These mtTokens will automatically accrue value over time and will be redeemable along with earned interest. Importantly, staking mtTokens will unlock access to MUTM passive dividends—generated from protocol revenue buybacks of MUTM tokens from the open market. Verified Progress with Layer-2, CertiK Audit, and Beta Launch Roadmap Unlike TON’s speculative spike and dip, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focused on execution. The team is preparing to launch a beta version of its platform by the time the token goes live. This launch will introduce real lending and borrowing utilities from day one—immediately putting the token’s use case into motion. To ensure transparency and security, the platform underwent a full CertiK audit. It achieved a Token Scan Score of 80.00 and a Skynet Score of 72.38 after both static and manual reviews. This verification process has strengthened investor confidence and helped Mutuum Finance (MUTM) build a rapidly growing user base, with over 12,250 holders and more than $10.85 million already raised in its presale Phase 5. Mutuum’s infrastructure is also being built with Layer-2 integration. This will reduce transaction fees and improve transaction speed—solving two of the most common pain points in DeFi today. Faster, cheaper execution will benefit all participants, whether they’re depositing into liquidity pools, repaying loans, or earning dividends from mtToken staking. Adding to the growing momentum is an ongoing $100K giveaway campaign. Ten early supporters will each win 10,000 MUTM tokens, showing that the team not only values its community but is also incentivizing early participation. Stablecoin, Smart Lending, and Why Investors Are Moving In Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also expanding its DeFi utility with the development of a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized options backed by fiat or reserves, this stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against assets like ETH and will be burned once loans are repaid or liquidated. This will make the supply entirely on-chain and algorithmically adjusted. The stablecoin’s interest rate will be governed by protocol settings instead of external market volatility. If the price strays from its $1 peg, governance will adjust the rate accordingly to restore balance. For example, when the stablecoin trades below $1, interest rates will increase, reducing borrowing and helping correct the price. Arbitrage will also play a role in keeping the price stable, ensuring safety and efficiency without centralized oversight. All stablecoin issuance will be limited to pre-approved issuers with capped allocations, minimizing systemic risk and enforcing strict accountability. The protocol will only allow overcollateralized loans, and liquidation mechanics will protect the system if collateral values fall—providing strong financial safeguards from the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not enforce strict minimum or maximum deposit sizes, offering flexibility for both small and large players. Whether you’re adding $50 or $50,000 into the liquidity pool, your assets will remain in non-custodial smart contracts, always under your control and traceable via your mtTokens. These tokens will track your share of the pool and any interest it earns—ensuring transparent and secure DeFi participation. As TON struggles to reclaim past highs, serious investors are redirecting their attention to projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—where value is being built on product, utility, and verified delivery. With strong passive income mechanics, a growing user base, advanced infrastructure, and a beta launch on the way, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just promising innovation—it is preparing to deliver it. And with the token still priced at just $0.03 in its presale phase, those who enter now are well-positioned to benefit from both early-stage growth and long-term income. As the platform rolls out, more investors are expected to move away from short-lived hype cycles and embrace real utility—and that spotlight is shifting directly onto Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

The digital asset, currently trading at $2.04—down 3.34% in the last 24 hours and 4.59% over the past week—remains in the spotlight due to developments surrounding its legal clarity, market integration, and ongoing push for XRP ETFs. A recent report by Times Tabloid has amplified anticipation by referencing comments from prominent crypto figure JackTheRippler, who claimed that “Judge Torres is ready to close Ripple (XRP) vs SEC case.” While the claim remains unofficial and lacks confirmation from court documents, it coincides with real-time procedural progress in the case. The prolonged legal battle has been a defining factor in XRP’s market behavior, and any final ruling would likely shift sentiment dramatically, particularly in the U.S. financial landscape. Google Gemini Projects a Bullish XRP Two-Year Trajectory In line with this development, Google’s AI chatbot Gemini has projected a bullish two-year trajectory for XRP. According to Gemini, the asset is expected to climb approximately 47% to reach $3 in 2026 and then surge by 292% to hit $8 in 2027. Gemini described the prediction as “a model-based estimate incorporating legal resolution probabilities, institutional adoption curves, and current market volatility metrics.” The forecast suggests that XRP may finally capitalize on its utility-driven fundamentals if lingering regulatory constraints are lifted. ETF Developments Add Structure to Investor Sentiment In a separate Times Tabloid article, crypto analyst Ripple Van Winkle (@RipBullWinkle) provided insight into the growing attention XRP is receiving from asset managers. The analyst shared detailed updates on various spot XRP ETF applications currently under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings include names of well-known firms, submission timelines, and upcoming decision deadlines, adding substance to the broader institutional interest in XRP-based investment vehicles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The presence of multiple ETF applications underscores an evolving appetite for XRP exposure through regulated channels. While approval timelines remain uncertain, the applications reflect a belief that XRP could soon be viewed as a sufficiently clarified and mature asset class for U.S.-based ETFs. Gemini’s prediction also appears to take this into account, highlighting institutional mechanisms as a key component of its valuation model. XRP Market Context Even with its short-term price experiencing minor corrections, XRP remains structurally positioned to benefit from a convergence of legal resolution, financial product innovation, and international payment use cases. Ripple’s continued partnerships and utility-focused expansion provide long-term support for the asset, particularly in regions outside the U.S. where regulatory clarity is already in place. Gemini’s price forecast, while conditional, presents a scenario where XRP’s value is not simply driven by market speculation, but by structural maturation and expanding access. Should court outcomes and ETF approvals align favorably within the 2026–2027 window, XRP’s potential to move toward $3 and then $8 may become increasingly credible within the evolving digital asset economy.

This marks the second reduction in recent months, following an initial drop from 75% to 60% around the January inauguration . The shift reportedly occurred at some point after June 8, with no public announcement accompanying the change This quiet divestment raises speculation that the Trump family could’ve realized a payout in the ballpark of hundreds of millions , depending on valuations drawn from comparable stablecoin ventures like Circle, which debuted with a market value near $1.7 billion. Based on these assumptions, Forbes estimates the family—and potentially Trump himself—might have pocketed nearly $190 million, with about $135 million going to Trump, if WLF drew a similar valuation Since last March, World Liberty has gone public with plans for its USD1 stablecoin, attracting a major $2 billion backing from a UAE‑linked investor and sparking comparisons to Circle in market size and momentum. The project has reportedly pulled in over $550 million through token sales. Ethics experts and lawmakers are sounding alarms over whether these moves—done with little public notice—could indicate that Trump is leveraging his presidential office to benefit private business interests . Critics note that the steady divestment pattern hints at a deliberate strategy to capitalize on the project’s valuation jumps—without triggering market alarms that a full public divestment might spark. This occurs amid broader shifts: the Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act regulating stablecoins, a move that sent Circle’s stock surging 34%, and may further influence WLF’s regulatory and valuation context. Summing up: Stake reduced quietly: From ~60% to ~40% post–June 8, with no announcement. Cash-out possible: Analysts peg potential Trump earnings in the high hundreds of millions.

Speaking at the BTC Prague 2025 conference on Saturday, Saylor’s keynote address highlighted both the evolving global crypto environment and his unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years,” Saylor told the crowd. “It’s a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” This bold forecast far exceeds his previous estimate from the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he projected Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045 . The shift, Saylor explained, stems from unforeseen global developments that have significantly strengthened BTC’s narrative over the past year. “A Sea Change in Politics” and Surging Adoption Saylor credited a “sea change” in geopolitical sentiment and U.S. policy as key reasons for his updated outlook. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary,” he said, pointing to the Biden administration’s surprising embrace of BTC and regulatory momentum in Congress. “We didn’t think the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” he said. “We didn’t think we’d get a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” The Strategy founder cited three major U.S. legislative efforts—the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act—as evidence of this changing tide. He emphasized that several U.S. states are also warming up to BTC, reflecting a broader shift in regulatory sentiment that “nobody guessed” just a year ago. Saylor, who has famously supported BTC through market highs and lows, said Donald Trump’s return to the White House further catalyzed this shift, boosting institutional confidence in BTC as a long-term asset. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Saylor’s renewed optimism comes as Strategy recently added another $1 billion in BTC to its holdings, bringing its total to 592,100 BTC as of June 15, 2025. However, questions remain about how and where this vast reserve is stored. While the firm has not revealed its custody arrangements, Saylor has publicly rejected calls to provide proof-of-reserves, citing security concerns. His previous dismissal of self-custody also drew criticism from the Bitcoin community—though he softened his stance in late 2024, saying he supported the approach “for those willing and able.” The post Michael Saylor Predicts $21 Million Bitcoin Price by 2046, Here’s Why appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Michael Saylor|Bitcoin price prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-06-22 10:31:00

The decline follows a major escalation in the Middle East where US military forces struck Iran’s nuclear sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, expanding the Israel-Iran conflict. This geopolitical shock triggered immediate market reactions with investors moving into traditional safe-haven assets like gold and the US dollar. Bitcoin, seen as a speculative asset during times of high volatility, fell 9% from its monthly high of $111,800 to $101,053. Bitcoin sold off all day & made up more than half of its losses in the last 30 minutes. Trump's announcement of direct US involvement in the Middle East marked the local bottom. pic.twitter.com/02Uxuqe21d — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) June 22, 2025 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is at $102,777 with over $47 billion in daily volume. The risk-off tone intensified after Iranian officials condemned the strikes and threatened retaliation. Iran’s Foreign Minister called for an emergency UN meeting, while Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a situation “getting out of control”. This sent equities and digital assets into a tailspin with BTC leading the way. Bitcoin Traders Reprice Risk as Bitcoin Falls The US strikes have deepened global fears of a wider war involving Israel, the US, and Iran. As tensions rose, Israel closed its airspace, Iran threatened key military and nuclear sites in the region and media reports emerged of bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles used in the operation. Israel closes airspace after US attack on Iranian targets; land crossings with Egypt, Jordan remain open – Airports Authority https://t.co/2zHClVYd9v pic.twitter.com/csMtu5kNFC — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) June 22, 2025 While the IAEA confirmed no radiation leaks, the psychological impact was big. Fears of disruption to global trade, energy markets and long-term regional security sent traders running. Bitcoin’s role as a hedge has again been called into question as it’s behaving like a risk asset during times of global stress. Monthly Drop: ~8.93% from $111,800 to $102,438 Weekly Loss: Over 2% and still falling Market Cap: $2.04 trillion Circulating Supply: 19.88 million BTC Former President Donald Trump’s comments saying the strikes were a “big success” only added to the fears of further escalation. With diplomacy stalled and Iran warning of “consequences forever” the crypto market is uncertain. Unless the political situation stabilizes, Bitcoin will likely continue to underperform as traders reduce risk. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Still Cautionary From a technical perspective, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish. The 2-hour chart shows price action stuck in a descending channel with lower highs and lower lows. BTC failed to retest $103,932—the 50-period EMA which is now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A series of small candles at $102,900 indicates indecision, but no bullish reversal patterns, such as a morning star or three white soldiers, have formed to change the trend. Momentum is weak with the MACD signal lines flatlining below zero and the histogram not recovering. BTC did briefly touch support at $101,478 before bouncing with a long lower wick, so buyers are defending that level for now. Bitcoin Trade Idea: Entry: At $102,900 on bearish confirmation (e.g. shooting star or bearish engulfing) Stop-Loss: Above $104,100 Target 1: $101,478 Target 2: $100,451 Until price breaks above $104,031 and out of the descending channel the short-term is bearish. Any bounce is likely corrective not a reversal. Conclusion Bitcoin’s drop to $102,760 is a sign of investors reducing risk in the Middle East chaos. With macro headwinds getting stronger and no technical confirmation of a bottom, traders should be cautious. A true “buy the dip” opportunity may require a ceasefire or a confirmed break above resistance.

Bitcoin tested resistance, Ethereum showed signs of consolidation, and Solana continued to battle bearish pressure. While gains were mixed, the underlying setups hint at brewing volatility and opportunities ahead. Whether you're tracking momentum or hunting early signals, the latest movements are worth your attention. This roundup is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native agency that aligns high-precision storytelling with real-time market insight. Bitcoin Bears Hold Ground as Bulls Struggle to Gain Momentum Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently in a tug-of-war between its bulls and bears, with prices bouncing between around $102,000 and nearly $110,000. The nearest resistance sits at close to $114,000, and it has struggled to break past this level. The bears seem to have a slight edge as Bitcoin’s price recently dipped by over 5% this month. However, there's still hope for bulls, as long-term trends show a growth of 9% over six months. To ignite a stronger rally, Bitcoin would need to surge roughly 15% from its current range to breach $122,000, where a significant resistance level lies. Ethereum Struggles to Break Out, Bulls Await Key Resistance Level Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is hovering between two and a half to three thousand dollars, showing a minor decline in recent weeks. The bulls seem hesitant but remain hopeful as they eye the three thousand sixty-dollar mark as a potential breakout point. The recent downtrend of about five percent over the week suggests caution, but the situation isn’t overly bleak yet. If Ethereum can rally past the top resistance barrier, it might push toward nearly three thousand five hundred, marking a potential climb of around twenty-five percent. However, if it dips below the support level of around two thousand one hundred eighty-five, a further decline might be on the horizon. Currently, market trends indicate a testing time for Ethereum enthusiasts. Solana Struggles as Bears Take the Lead Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, showing signs of bearish momentum. Its price has slipped over 4% this week, nearly 18% this past month, and over 21% in the last six months, reflecting weakness in bullish support. With an RSI around 50, the market isn't oversold or overbought, but bears seem to dominate. Resistance is around $181, with stronger resistance at $208, making these levels crucial for any bullish breakout. Support is found at $126.67 and further down at $99.27, which might see testing if the bearish trend continues. Solana's potential upside from its current range could reach 25% if bulls can reclaim momentum and aim for resistance levels.

Returns during beta already exceeded many staking platforms. There are no hardware barriers, no staking lockups, and no technical complexity. The app is live, and it’s growing in user base as more people realize they can earn simply by participating. The protocol’s infrastructure has passed independent audit by Freshcoins , while core contracts have been verified by Cyberscope . The development team has completed full KYC verification , establishing trust ahead of launch. Analyst Coverage Confirms Early Momentum Bitcoin Solaris is gaining attention for the right reasons. In a recent Crypto Vlog review , the project was praised for delivering actual results at the presale stage — a rarity in the current market. Analysts are watching early performance metrics, not just the roadmap. More importantly, users are actively engaging with the network, mining with mobile devices and earning before any centralized exchange listing. While other early projects ask investors to wait for value, Bitcoin Solaris is distributing it from the start. Supply Is Fixed, Demand Is Active, and Pricing Is Still Low Bitcoin Solaris is capped at 21 million tokens. Just 4.2 million are in the presale. No emissions. No delayed unlocks. No backdoor allocations. Supply is clean and predictable — and every token already has a function. BTC-S is used for transaction fees, for mining rewards, and inside the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — which is live and running now. Every registered user gets one free spin per day. No token required. Just log in, spin, and collect if you win. For buyers, the casino unlocks reward tiers based on purchase size. Spend $250, and you access bigger spins. Spend $2,500, and you’re in for draws worth up to 0.5 BTC. It’s fast, automatic, and designed to keep tokens circulating instead of sitting idle. The token will also power the Mining Power Marketplace, now under construction. There, users will rent and monetize excess compute power on-chain. Supply meets demand, directly — no third parties needed. Products Are Live and In Use Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising a future product — it’s already operational. The Nova App is doing what it’s supposed to. People are mining. The Casino is running every day and pushing tokens back into circulation. The Marketplace is being built now — not promised later. Wallet upgrades are on the schedule, testnet is close, and the dev suite is nearly wrapped. None of this is staged for marketing — it’s work in progress, backed by actual timelines, not placeholder graphics on a pitch deck. Bitcoin Solaris is producing returns, distributing access, and expanding adoption before most altcoins even finish their whitepapers. Price momentum is already building inside the presale. Phase 8 is open. Supply is limited. And for serious investors, this may be the last cycle where early-stage, real-utility gains are still within reach.

Solana’s pullback may be setting up a breakout, Cardano is flashing early reversal signals, and XRP is quietly showing strength in the face of uncertainty. These trending tokens could be the first to rally if momentum returns. This market preview is supported by Outset PR —an agency that merges data analytics, editorial finesse, and proprietary distribution tools to help crypto projects rise with the tide. When interest spikes and sentiment shifts, Outset PR ensures your project gets seen, heard, and remembered. Solana (SOL): Pullback or Launchpad? Bulls Eye Major Reversal Levels Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, suggesting a consolidation phase that could turn bullish with the right momentum. Despite a recent 4% dip this week and an 18% monthly pullback, the RSI hovers around 50—indicating a neutral zone that could quickly swing upward. Key resistance levels at $181 and $208 offer nearly 25–35% upside from current prices if bulls step back in. As Solana continues expanding its DeFi and NFT ecosystems and benefits from high-speed scalability, any shift in sentiment could spark a rapid push through resistance. Long-term believers may see this dip as an entry point rather than a warning sign. Cardano (ADA): Oversold Signals Could Spark a Rebound Source: tradingview Cardano's price is fluctuating between $0.59 and $0.71, with bears leading short-term movements after a 24% drop this past month. However, support above $0.54 has held strong so far, and a bounce from this level could target $0.78 and even $0.90—a potential 30% move. With the RSI below 50, the asset is edging closer to oversold territory, possibly setting up a trend reversal. Cardano’s strong developer activity, expanding dApp ecosystem, and upcoming protocol upgrades may fuel fresh demand. If the broader market stabilizes, ADA could become one of the week’s surprise gainers. XRP (XRP): Stability Amid Volatility Signals Hidden Strength Source: tradingview XRP is trading steadily between $2.00 and $2.30, showing resilience even as broader market uncertainty weighs on momentum. Though it remains just under its 10-day moving average of $2.13, the weekly decline is under 1%, suggesting strong underlying support. Resistance at $2.45 remains the next major hurdle, and a breakout could push XRP toward $2.70—about a 17% gain from current levels. With support holding around $1.94, the technical base looks solid for a bullish attempt. As institutional interest in XRP-based payments continues to grow, it could quietly outperform expectations in the near term.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00006717 to $0.00007676. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.000125 with an average price of $0.00012. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has decreased to $0.00001253 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 8.30 percent of its worth today. Technical indicators favor sellers, and the price charts also continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000125, which is approximately 691% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its value decreased to $0.00001253. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk’s price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent depreciation. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000020. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2027. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000125 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

The US launched an attack on Iran, bombing three nuclear enrichment sites. Bitcoin declined 7.5% amid growing fears over the Israel-Iran war escalation. The cryptocurrency market experienced a massive selloff last week amid growing fears of war escalation. Bitcoin and other top cryptos’ prices pulled back following rumors that the US may get involved and attack Iran over claims of the Asian country’s illegal nuclear enrichment. The rumors became reality early Sunday morning when the US launched an attack on Iran, bombing three of the country’s major nuclear sites. According to reports , President Trump said the strikes “totally obliterated” Iran’s nuclear enrichment facility. He further advised Iran to “make peace” or face “greater attacks” in the future.

After Trump ordered airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, crypto took a tumble. XRP slid nearly 16% in the last month, dipping from around $2.47 to $2.04 amid panic across the market. Meanwhile, $595M in bullish bets were wiped out during the crash, as U.S. military action triggered massive liquidations across Bitcoin, Ether and major altcoins. In times like these, meme coins and high-risk tokens can either crater or skyrocket – all depending on where investors place their bets. With volatility spiking, crypto presales and speculative coins have the chance to steal the spotlight. Here are three new crypto projects worth watching right now. Markets in Turmoil as U.S. Airstrikes Rock Iran and Crypto Alike First, let’s unpack what just happened. On June 21, President Trump ordered precision airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. The attack followed escalating tensions in the Gulf, with U.S. officials citing renewed nuclear enrichment activity and regional security threats. Within hours, markets reacted. Oil prices spiked, gold jumped, and crypto – known for its volatility – saw sharp red across the board. XRP , a major altcoin, continued its month-long slide, nearing the $2 mark. More importantly, the fear-driven selloff triggered a wave of forced liquidations: over 172K leveraged traders were wiped out in 24 hours, erasing $595M in bullish crypto bets. Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped several percent before recovering slightly, showing just how sensitive the market is to geopolitical shocks. Now, with traditional coins reeling, attention is turning to speculative assets, as traders hunt for narrative-driven rebound plays that could outpace the majors. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – The First Solana Layer 2 Is Built for Speed Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana, created to solve the exact issues that have plagued the network for years: congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. By enhancing Solana’s already blazing speed and combining it with the vast liquidity of Ethereum, Solaxy delivers a multichain solution that’s fast, reliable, and ready for the next generation of DeFi and meme coins. $SOLX is the native token of the Solaxy blockchain and will live on both Ethereum and Solana, giving users seamless access to the most powerful ecosystems in crypto. With tools that democratize high-frequency meme coin trading, putting sniper bot precision into the hands of regular traders. Solaxy levels the playing field in explosive new markets. $SOLX is currently priced at $0.001766 with $56M raised in presale. And today is the last day to buy the token at this price before the token launch. As crypto reels from Trump’s airstrikes, Solaxy offers the kind of speed and stability that traders are desperate for right now. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – The Meme Coin That Actually Pays You in Bitcoin BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn’t your average meme coin – it’s a full-throttle, community-driven ride built to chase Bitcoin’s legendary climb to $1M. While most meme coins trade on hype alone, $BTCBULL brings real rewards to the table. As Bitcoin hits major price milestones (like $150K, or $200K), $BTCBULL holders earn actual Bitcoin straight to their wallets. Just remember that you need to buy and hold the token in Best Wallet in order to receive Bitcoin airdrops. No complex BRC-20s, no fuss – just link up with Best Wallet and get rewarded in the king of crypto. $BTCBULL also uses milestone-based burns to reduce token supply as Bitcoin rises, turning every new all-time high into a catalyst for $BTCBULL’s scarcity and value. Think of it as a turbocharged meme coin strapped to Bitcoin’s moon mission. Right now, you can buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002575, with $7.2M raised in presale. It’s the only meme project that fuses $BTC’s long-term strength with community-powered upside. As markets wobble from Trump’s Iran airstrikes, $BTCBULL offers a rare blend: meme-fueled energy plus real Bitcoin rewards when the rebound kicks in. 3. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) – Meme Culture Meets Layer‑2 Performance Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the first meme‑coin built on its own EVM-compatible Layer‑2 blockchain, recently launched to solve Ethereum’s gas pain and congestion for meme projects. It’s like a custom racing strip just for meme traders – zero buy/sell tax, ultra‑low fees, sniper‑bot protections, and blazing-fast transactions. Its native token, $LILPEPE, fuels governance, transaction fees, staking rewards, and access to ‘Pepe’s Pump Pad,’ a launchpad for safe meme‑coin drops. The presale has raised $1.7M so far, and current price sits at $0.0012 per token. Stage 1 was sold out in 72 hours, and Stage 2 filled fast – underscoring strong community demand. With audit-backed smart contracts and a roadmap that includes centralized listings and Layer‑2 rollouts, Little Pepe blends meme hype with real infrastructure. Perfect timing as traders search for safe, narrative-driven plays in the post‑crash shake‑out. Big Moves, Bigger Risks Looking to ride the market rebound? Solaxy brings the speed and scalability traders need, BTC Bull Token delivers meme-powered Bitcoin upside, and Little Pepe offers a fresh take on meme coins with real infrastructure. Each project taps into a different corner of the market, but all come with high risk and high reward potential. Stay sharp, stay curious, and maybe don’t bet the farm.

Dogecoin Drops While VeChain Gains Strength",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-confirms-july-shipping-after-selling-18100-miners-dogecoin-drops-while-vechain-gains-strength/,"Dogecoin has been facing a difficult stretch. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price chart indicates continued downside pressure, with key support areas showing signs of weakness. While DOGE attempts to stabilize, the VeChain ecosystem is gaining ground, introducing a major upgrade that’s drawing attention toward utility, rewards, and overall ecosystem strength. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is moving from plans to delivery. With over 18,100 X-Series miners sold and shipments scheduled to begin in July, it’s taking a tangible step rarely seen in the space. Backed by over $318 million in presale funds and paired with real hardware rollout, BlockDAG is gaining momentum in conversations around the best-performing crypto coins today. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Chart Suggests Further Weakness The Dogecoin (DOGE) price chart shows the coin has lost 13% in value over the past week and now trades at $0.17. Analysts are monitoring a potential drop to $0.14, a zone viewed as crucial for maintaining bullish hopes. If DOGE falls further, it could revisit past support between $0.12 and $0.08, levels last reached in 2024. However, some market watchers believe a mild rebound could occur if the price tests those ranges. As broader altcoins attempt recovery, DOGE’s next move remains under close observation. VeChain Ecosystem Gains Traction with Stargate Milestone The VeChain ecosystem is evolving with the Stargate upgrade, introducing validator tiers, higher staking returns, and NFT-based tools for user participation. These changes aim to strengthen long-term utility by refining reward logic and ecosystem functions. Recent highlights include the Mugshot app surpassing 1 million users, Dana White joining as an advisor, and new interoperability via WanChain. With ongoing European regulatory developments and major business partnerships, VeChain’s adoption outlook and stability are gaining renewed focus. BlockDAG Confirms July Shipments with Over 18,100 X-Series Miners Sold BlockDAG’s mining rollout is entering an important phase as it prepares to ship its X-Series models. So far, more than 18,100 units have been purchased, generating $7.3 million in revenue from mining hardware alone. The larger X30 and X100 miners will ship from July 7, while the compact X10 device begins dispatch on August 15. The X10 offers up to 200 BDAG daily, the X30 mines up to 600 BDAG, and the high-powered X100 can reach 2,000 BDAG each day. These models cater to different mining goals, making the ecosystem accessible to a wide range of users. By focusing on actual product delivery along with blockchain progress, BlockDAG is setting itself apart. Current presale activity mirrors the rising interest. Over 23 billion BDAG coins have been sold, with total presale funds surpassing $318 million. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, marking a 2,660% gain from its initial price of $0.001. A limited-time offer now provides BDAG at $0.0020, sparking rapid buying among those tracking early gains. Some projections peg BDAG’s future value at $5, driven partly by the profitability of mining. If BDAG hits that price, the X100’s daily return could equal $10,000, which explains the high demand for miners and strong presale growth. BlockDAG is gaining more recognition in talks around the best-performing crypto coins, mainly due to its physical infrastructure paired with blockchain delivery. To Wrap Up! DOGE remains under pressure, with the Dogecoin (DOGE) price chart reflecting potential for further loss if it breaks support. Meanwhile, the VeChain ecosystem is progressing steadily, backed by Stargate’s improvements and broader tech expansion. But the spotlight now turns to BlockDAG. With 18,100+ X-Series miners sold, shipments set for July, and over $318 million in presale funding, it’s proving progress over promises. BDAG is now priced at $0.0020 for a limited period, offering a rare entry point. With 2 million X1 users and 20 exchanges already confirmed post-GO LIVE, it’s drawing wide attention as one of the best-performing crypto coins today.

This New Audited Token Just Entered The Market Reaching 50% in Weeks,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/why-wait-for-solana-sol-this-new-audited-token-just-entered-the-market-reaching-50-in-weeks,"Solana (SOL) has been a consistent name in the crypto market, known for its high throughput and scalability. However, rising competition and a maturing market have made some investors turn to emerging projects for better returns. One such project is Ruvi AI (RUVI), a new player combining AI innovation with blockchain technology. With a presale that’s already raised over $1.9 million and a pricing structure that has delivered 50% growth in just weeks, Ruvi AI could be the smarter alternative to Solana. Why Ruvi AI May Outperform Solana Solana has gained its reputation as a scalable, decentralized platform perfect for DeFi applications. However, Ruvi AI takes a multi-industry approach, offering real-world applications in marketing, entertainment, and finance. By focusing on practical solutions for industrial challenges, Ruvi AI creates long-term relevance and demand for its token. Ruvi AI also stands out for its structured growth model. Currently, during Phase 2 of its presale, RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.015 per token, giving early investors a unique opportunity to enter at an affordable level. Upon the conclusion of the presale, the token’s value is guaranteed to rise to $0.07, delivering an almost 5x ROI. Analysts project that RUVI could skyrocket to $1 post-listing, resulting in a potential 66x ROI for those who get in now. Unlike Solana’s speculative growth path, Ruvi AI provides a transparent and predictable roadmap. Presale Success Signals Strong Market Interest There’s no doubt that the market is paying attention to Ruvi AI. Its presale performance boasts impressive milestones, including: $1.9 million raised, signifying strong investor confidence. Over 160 million tokens sold, highlighting widespread demand. A community of more than 1,600 holders, showing active interest in the token’s future. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its guaranteed $0.07 valuation at the end of the presale. This planned price ensures stability and eliminates the volatility often seen in emerging tokens. For savvy investors, this clarity is a breath of fresh air compared to traditional speculative tokens like Solana. Lucrative VIP Tiers Maximize Returns Ruvi AI goes one step further to reward its early backers with its VIP investment tiers, providing generous bonuses for increased contributions. Here’s how they work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers help early investors amplify their returns even before public trading begins, a feature Solana doesn’t offer. Transparency and Security Drive Investor Trust Ruvi AI goes beyond offering a strong value proposition; it prioritizes transparency and security. The platform recently underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope, a leading name in blockchain security, ensuring technical reliability for investors. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, providing post-presale liquidity that ensures RUVI tokens are immediately tradable upon listing. This partnership helps investors avoid the waiting periods and trading limitations that plague many early-stage tokens. Real-World Applications Differentiate Ruvi AI Unlike Solana, which focuses almost exclusively on DeFi and NFT applications, Ruvi AI’s utility spans several major industries. Some of its standout applications include: Marketing: Using AI to optimize campaigns, target ads effectively, and boost ROI for businesses. Entertainment: Supporting content creators with blockchain-secured payments and AI personalization, improving engagement and profitability. Finance: Revolutionizing financial systems with advanced fraud detection and scalable blockchain solutions. This wide-ranging utility ensures Ruvi AI remains relevant for years to come, regardless of market conditions. Why Ruvi AI May Be the Better Bet While Solana continues to innovate within the blockchain space, Ruvi AI’s bold approach to combining blockchain and AI across multiple industries creates greater upside potential for early investors. Starting at just $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI’s planned rise to $0.07 and eventual $1 valuation makes it one of the most compelling opportunities for 2025. Having already raised $1.9 million and sold over 160 million tokens, Ruvi AI’s presale success speaks volumes. Coupled with strategic partnerships like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI has set itself apart as a secure and scalable investment.

This new token blends artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, opening up possibilities across various sectors including finance, marketing, and entertainment. Key Differences Between Ruvi AI and Solana While Solana has been a major player due to its efficiency in DeFi applications, Ruvi AI proposes broader applications, promising to penetrate markets that require AI solutions backed by blockchain. This approach not only diversifies its utility but also ensures long-term demand for its tokens. Ruvi AI has just concluded Phase 2 of its presale, offering tokens at a compelling price of $0.015 each. They plan to increase this to $0.07 at the end of the presale, ensuring early investors can anticipate significant returns. Projections suggest the price could soar to $1 per token post-listing, potentially resulting in substantial gains for initial backers. Understanding the Presale Success of Ruvi AI The initial offering stages of Ruvi AI have demonstrated remarkable market interest: With $1.9 million raised during its presale, Ruvi AI showcases strong investor trust. Over 160 million tokens have been sold, indicating high demand. The project has attracted over 1,600 token holders, reflecting a growing community confident in its roadmap. The stability guaranteed by a post-presale price of $0.07 per token sets Ruvi AI apart from volatile new entrants in the crypto market. This move could offer a more secure investment compared to speculative tokens, providing clear financial horizons to investors. Enhanced Investment Opportunities through VIP Tiers Ruvi AI introduces an innovative rewards system with VIP tiers that offer sizable bonuses to significant contributors: VIP Tier 2, for a $750 investment, offers a 40% bonus, potentially increasing token values significantly from presale to post-listing prices. VIP Tier 3 increases the bonus to 60% for a $2,100 investment, amplifying potential returns considerably. The most generous, VIP Tier 5, offers a 100% bonus for a $9,600 investment, doubling the investor's token count and potentially resulting in substantial financial gains. Partnerships and Operational Transparency Ruvi AI's strategic collaborations and transparent operations act as trust-builders. The project's recent audit by CyberScope promises security and reliability, while its partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures liquidity post-presale. The broader applicability of Ruvi AI in real-world scenarios significantly extends beyond the confines of DeFi and NFTs, which are the primary focus of Solana. This versatility could make Ruvi AI a pivotal player in the blockchain space. Final Take: Is Ruvi AI a Worthwhile Investment? Combining AI and blockchain technology, Ruvi AI presents a compelling investment opportunity, especially for those who join during its early stages. The planned price growth, coupled with innovative applications and firm security measures, positions it as a formidable contender in the evolving blockchain landscape.

Bitcoin dropped to an intraday low of around $101,000, causing a considerable uptick in liquidated positions. Bitcoin Price Dips to $101,000 As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, Bitcoin’s price dipped to an intraday low of $101,000. It has since recovered a little bit and trades at $102,500 at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView That said, the volatiltity remains enhanced, which has resulted in a whopping $700 million worth of liquidated positions across derivatives markets. Data from CoinGlass shows that this represents an increase of more than 55% compared to yesterday’s levels, attesting to the uncertainty of the ongoing situation. The turmoil is largely caused by the US decision to strike Iran earlier today, despite Donald Trump saying that he will take two weeks to decide on future moves, just a few days ago. Bahrain and Kuwait, home to US bases, also started making preparations for the possibility the conflict might spread to their territory in a clear sign of escalation. The same is true for Saudi Arabia. Altcoins Deep in the Red The declines spread across altcoin markets as well, which took even bigger of a beating.

The altcoins have posted even more notable price declines, which is evident from the growing BTC dominance. Bitcoin Tries to Recover The business week began on a different note as the primary cryptocurrency shot from under $105,000 to $109,000 by Tuesday. However, it faced an immediate and violent rejection that pushed it south hard as the tension in the Middle East continued to rage on. In a matter of hours, BTC dumped to $103,500 before the bulls initiated an impressive leg up that drove the asset higher by around $3,000. Nevertheless, the overall negative market sentiment continued , and bitcoin started to lose value once again in the following days. The culmination came earlier today as the US launched “successful” attacks against multiple nuclear sites in Iran, as described by the POTUS. Moreover, Trump warned that there will be more violent strikes if Iran decides to retaliate in any form. Bitcoin’s price tumbled below $101,000 for the first time in almost three weeks. However, it remained within a six-digit price territory and has recovered to $102,500 as of now. Its market cap is down to $2.040 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the alts has skyrocketed to almost 63% as most bleed out. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Deep in Red The rising BTC dominance in times when the cryptocurrency’s price is dropping means only one thing – the alts have it even worse. Interestingly, it’s not just the lower caps that are suffering badly. Ethereum, the largest of the bunch, has dumped by over 7% in the past 24 hours and is close to breaking below $2,200. Recall that ETH stood tall close to $2,800 just until a week ago. Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, SUI, LINK, HBAR, and LINK are also deep in the red from the bigger alts. Even more painful declines come from VIRTUAL, APT, INJ, TIA, TAO, SEI, JUP, FET, and PEPE, as all of them are down by double-digits on a daily scale.

Leading this charge are three altcoins with an unmistakable edge: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and the rising star FloppyPepe (FPPE) . As the first half of the year ends, investors are eyeing high-potential altcoins that could 100x by July, and these three are positioned to dominate. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI-Powered Meme Coin with Explosive Upside While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have long been staples in the world of altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as the game-changer. This altcoin newcomer redefines the meme coin sector. It's secret? A shrinking supply model combined with zero transaction taxes makes it the ideal investment for those seeking maximum returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is far more than a traditional meme token. It blends artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, making it a powerhouse altcoin. Its AI agents, like the Meme‑o‑Matic and FloppyX Video AI, assist creators and influencers in generating compelling memes and captivating video content from text prompts. FloppyAI, a conversational AI bot trained to provide precise crypto insights based on user prompts. Start prompt here . This AI-based utility positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the center of a growing trend that will dominate the altcoin space in 2025. 100x - 550x For Early Investors With 80% Bonus With the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale in Stage 2, tokens are available at $0.00000035, and early adopters are offered an 80% bonus with code ""FLOPPY80."" Experts project this meme coin can rise 550x by July, making early entry a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Here’s how a modest investment could grow: Initial Investment Potential ROI at 550x Growth $1,000 $550,000 $5,000 $2,750,000 $10,000 $5,500,000 Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which carries high gas fees, this meme coin boasts no transaction taxes. Its deflationary mechanism burns 1% of every transaction, reducing supply and rewarding holders. Another 1% goes directly to holders, making the token an ideal long-term hold. With the presale in its second phase and liquidity pouring in, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining unstoppable momentum with increasing whale activity. Those joining now can secure life-changing returns. Ethereum (ETH): The Smart Contract King Ethereum (ETH) has long been the bedrock of decentralized finance and NFT ecosystems. The shift to proof-of-stake and scalability improvements solidifies Ethereum’s (ETH) role in the next wave of altcoins. Yet despite its dominance, Ethereum (ETH) is still weighed down by rising gas fees and network congestion. While Ethereum (ETH) may struggle to deliver the same level of returns as smaller, more agile projects. “Titan Of Crypto,” an analyst on X, is optimistic about a breakout that can fuel a potential Ethereum (ETH) 100x rally, which could spark a revival for other altcoins, making now the best time to accumulate. Solana (SOL): The High‑Speed Challenger Solana (SOL) shines with its blazing transaction speeds and low costs, making it one of the best-performing altcoins of the last cycle. Solana’s (SOL) strong developer base and expanding ecosystem continue to draw attention. Solana (SOL) has seen a decline in price lately, currently trading at $145, but its 1H chart is promising, and SOSA, a trader on X, confirms a push towards $154. However, unlike FloppyPepe’s curated burns, Solana’s (SOL) highly circulated supply and institutional focus limit its potential, making it ideal for more conservative allocations rather than breakout plays. The New Leader of the Altcoins Movement While Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) remain cornerstones of the altcoin market , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to dominate as the breakout star of 2025. Its AI-driven meme generation, zero transaction tax, and deflationary supply model set it apart from traditional offerings. The ongoing presale, currently in its second stage, presents the chance to secure a stake in a project designed to deliver a 550x ROI. Act now and join the wave of early adopters who recognize FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique potential. Claim 80% bonus tokens using the code FLOPPY80, and secure a top position in the next era of AI-amplified altcoins.

Currently priced at just $0.03, analysts are eyeing a potential parabolic rise, with projections hinting at a possible 9,400% surge. Early investors are going to get a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI as the token goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance is far outpacing Cardano (ADA), which continues to hover near the $0.59 range as it struggles to reclaim its $3 all-time high. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the answer to which crypto to buy today for long-term growth. Cardano’s Recent Price Profile & Market Dynamics Cardano (ADA) is exchanging hands at about 0.60, recording a minor dip of 2-3% in the last 24 hours on the backdrop of active on-chain activity. The market is witnessing a compressing range with major technical indications pointing them to increases in pressure under the $0.60 floor. Analysts are feeling bullish about its break leading to a potential drop marginally in the mid $0.50s, before a successful bounce above the $0.75 zone. The fundamentals, however, are still in place–wallet adoption is growing and recent ecosystem developments reflect the seriousness of ongoing activities within the system as ADA looks ahead. In this calmer performance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is slowly rising through the ranks with a steeper upward curve. Presale Frenzy Peaks, Mutuum Finance Hits $10.9M Raised Mutuum Finance is running wild in popularity. With its trailblazing two-way lending model, this DeFi behemoth has already attracted more than 12,300 investors and raised $10.9 million, and it’s not slowing down. The MUTM token price will jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, a 16.67% increase, so investors who come aboard here are in for massive gains. Early bird investors are locking profits. Mutuum Finance Lending: Smarter, Simpler, Decentralized Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, offering users stable returns from USDT pools via the P2C framework and full ownership of direct crypto transfer via the P2P framework. Mutuum Finance’s USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability while avoiding flaws found in algorithmic stablecoins. While the project is already certified by CertiK, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and investors who pay attention at this point might benefit the most in the future. On top of that, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining ground as one of the most talked-about altcoins in 2025, especially among investors searching for the next big opportunity. Currently priced at just $0.03, the token offers immediate upside with a guaranteed 100% ROI once it launches at $0.06. But the bigger story lies in its long-term potential, with some projections suggesting gains as high as 9,400%. While Cardano continues to hover around the $0.60 mark, struggling to revisit its all-time high of $3, Mutuum Finance is accelerating with stronger momentum and deeper innovation. The project’s unique lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems, gives users full control over their assets while offering real utility and sustainable returns. Add in the upcoming launch of a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, a successful CertiK audit, and over $10.9 million raised from more than 12,300 early adopters, and it’s clear why so many are calling MUTM the best crypto to buy now. As the presale heads toward its next price jump and a $100,000 giveaway adds even more excitement, early investors have a rare chance to get in before this project truly takes off.

In a Saturday X post , he commented: “It was great to meet Knafo Sarah, and she’s invited us to visit France! Looking forward to starting a nation-state Bitcoin adoption wave in France and perhaps all of Europe!” Samson Mow discussed Bitcoin agenda with Sarah Knafo At the BTC Prague event this week, Mow met with a member of the European Parliament, Sarah Knafo, and discussed how his company could help craft Bitcoin-forward policies in France and develop a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Knafo even described their meeting as excellent and acknowledged Mow for his advisory role to the president of El Salvador and many other leaders. She added that France has to step up and tackle these issues head-on, hinting at more Bitcoin advocacy in the future. According to Knafo, she invited Mow and his team to France. She also met with Strategy’s founder, Michael Saylor, who she found to be “visionary and ambitious.” France has been actively expanding its involvement with crypto. Most recently, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 BTC for €60.2 million, about $68.7 million, raising its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, in March, Bpifrance committed €25 million, equal to about $27 million , to cryptocurrency investments to support France’s blockchain and crypto innovation. Revolut , a European neobank with crypto support, also announced plans to invest over $1.1 billion in France and pursue a local banking license in May. It is also preparing to add at least 200 more people within three years. Knafo confirmed that more crypto projects will soon be in Europe and the country. So far, about 10% of French citizens hold crypto assets, and roughly 33% of French people plan to acquire crypto assets in 2025. However, France still lags behind compared to adoption rates in the UK (19%), the Netherlands (17%), and Belgium (17%). However, France has seen a 10-point increase in public interest, reaching 33%. This puts it just behind Italy, which leads at 37%. Europe’s crypto adoption is still low compared to other countries worldwide Some crypto executives have expressed concerns over Europe’s lower crypto adoption than the rest of the world. In March, Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, a European real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, stated that European corporate adoption remains limited. Fabrega argued that the investors are reluctant to join the crypto community because of underlying structural barriers, including regulatory uncertainty, lack of institutional endorsement, and an underdeveloped market. He added, “Europe has yet to take a definitive stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Nonetheless, the European Union has become more open to crypto assets, first proposing Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), a digital token regulatory framework, in September 2020, adopting it in May 2023, and fully implementing it in December 2024.

This move came as Circle’s stock surged 20.4% on the day, closing at $240.30 — a staggering 248% increase from its debut price of $69 on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5. Despite this rapid appreciation, ARK’s strategy appears focused on profit-taking, selling a total of 1.25 million CRCL shares over the past week for approximately $243 million. Daily CRCL Offloads from Three Major ARK Funds Friday’s sale marked ARK Invest’s third consecutive daily dump of Circle stock , continuing a trend of significant divestment. The bulk of Friday’s sale came from ARK’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which offloaded 490,549 shares. Meanwhile, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) sold 75,018 and 43,608 shares, respectively. Earlier in the week, ARK sold $52 million in CRCL on Monday and followed up with a $45 million sale on Tuesday. Collectively, the past week’s sales amount to nearly 29% of the 4.49 million shares ARK acquired during Circle’s public listing. Despite the heavy selling, ARK remains among the top shareholders of CRCL. As of June 20, ARK is the eighth-largest holder of CRCL, according to Bloomberg Terminal data. The firm still retains $750.4 million worth of Circle shares, demonstrating confidence in the company’s long-term value, even amid the short-term profit-taking strategy. Circle Becomes Top Holding in ARKW Fund Circle has swiftly become a core asset in ARK’s portfolios, especially in the ARKW fund, where it now represents the top holding with a weight of 7.8%. While ARK trims its position to capitalize on rapid gains, other major stakeholders remain heavily invested. IDG-Accel China Capital Fund II holds the largest stake at 23.3 million shares, followed by General Catalyst Group Management with 20.1 million and investor James Breyer with 16.7 million shares. The active trading around CRCL suggests that while ARK is securing profits, Circle’s role in the crypto-fintech sector continues to attract strong institutional interest.

Early-stage presale tokens have consistently outperformed the broader market, especially when backed by real tech, active communities, and massive potential. According to recent Live Coin Watch data, many of today’s top performers were once unknown $5 or $8 tokens. Now, a new contender is catching fire, and it’s not just talk. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as the next massive mover, and momentum is accelerating faster than expected. Kaspa Made Waves, But Can It Reach the Masses? Kaspa has been a favorite in the proof-of-work crowd for its blockDAG approach and speed. Its underlying technology is impressive and solves several legacy blockchain issues, especially around scalability. However, it still requires traditional hardware to mine, which makes it less approachable for the everyday user. Despite strong developer backing, Kaspa hasn’t bridged the gap between institutional-grade innovation and widespread accessibility. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris flips the script. Bitcoin Solaris Is Rewriting the Crypto Playbook Bitcoin Solaris was built on a single idea: make mining and blockchain wealth creation something anyone can participate in. From a technical angle, the project is light years ahead. At its core is a dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This hybrid approach gives BTC-S both security and scalability, delivering up to 100,000 transactions per second on the Solaris Layer with 2-second finality. But the deeper magic is in its accessibility. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine BTC-S straight from their phone, laptop, or even browser. This alone has positioned BTC-S as one of the most inclusive mining ecosystems in crypto today. Key Features Driving Momentum: Dual-consensus architecture for maximum scalability and security Validator rotation and cross-layer interaction for network resilience Up to 100,000 TPS and real-time block finality Energy-efficient mining using just 0.05% of Bitcoin’s energy footprint Zero-Knowledge Proofs for optional privacy features Smart contract infrastructure built for DeFi, gaming, enterprise, and more The combination of speed, power, and accessibility is making it one of the most talked-about presale tokens right now. The Rise of Universal Mining: Wealth from Your Pocket BTC-S isn’t just about powerful infrastructure. It’s about making that power usable by anyone. Thanks to its Universal Mining model, users can mine directly from nearly any device. A smartphone? Done. A regular laptop? Easy. Even advanced miners with ASICs and GPUs are supported, with the system optimizing performance per device. Once live, the upcoming Solaris Nova App will give users access to: One-tap mining with adaptive algorithms Built-in wallet with real-time rewards tracking In-app tutorials to guide beginners Compatibility with Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and web For those looking to calculate what they could earn from mining, the BTC-S mining calculator is a great starting point. No GPUs, No Gatekeepers Bitcoin Solaris Puts Power in Your Hands A Community That’s Already Catching Fire More than 11,500 users have already joined the presale, and interest continues to climb. Many crypto influencers and analysts are calling it one of the best early-stage opportunities of the year. A detailed review from the Crypto Vlog breaks down why this project is drawing attention across the ecosystem, from retail holders to serious mining enthusiasts. What makes Bitcoin Solaris stand out isn’t just hype. It’s transparency. The project has already passed audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , ensuring the underlying technology is secure and trustworthy. The team also maintains an active presence through platforms like Telegram and X , where updates and community conversations continue to grow daily. Why This Presale Is a Big Deal The Bitcoin Solaris presale is already in its eighth phase and gaining serious traction. The price is currently $8, with the next jump coming soon. The launch price is set at $20, offering a potential return of 150 percent for early participants. Time is limited, though. With the launch set for July 31, only around six weeks remain before the window closes. This is not just a typical token sale. It’s shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive presales in crypto history. With over $5 million raised and thousands already onboard, it’s hard to ignore the momentum. To get involved or learn more, check out Bitcoin Solaris . A Technical Core That Backs the Hype What sets BTC-S apart is that the performance isn’t just talk. Its reward distribution system is finely tuned, offering structured incentives that prioritize long-term contribution and network health. BTC-S reward distribution structure: 40 percent goes to PoW miners 25 percent to Solaris Layer validators 20 percent to stakeholders 10 percent reserved for development 5 percent power community incentives Mining rewards are calculated based on device type, contribution score, and time-weighted participation, ensuring fairness and decentralization. These mechanics are why many are calling it a project built not only to last but to empower. Final Thoughts: Is This the Wealth Gateway You’ve Been Waiting For? Bitcoin Solaris is more than a coin. It’s a gateway into a new era of wealth creation, one that doesn’t care if you’re holding a $3,000 rig or a budget smartphone. While other projects chase high-speed numbers or institutional validation, BTC-S is quietly building something for the people. If you’re looking to enter crypto with real utility, real earning potential, and real accessibility, Bitcoin Solaris might just be your moment.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, the Black Swan author says that the US dollar has lost its status as a reliable safe-haven asset, noting that people prefer to invest in the stock market rather than hold a currency that declines in value over time. He also says that America’s sweeping sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine marked the beginning of the end of the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency. According to Taleb, gold is now the world’s reserve currency, highlighting that the dollar’s credibility eroded after America and its allies weaponized the USD. “That would end up being reflected in stocks, the slow decline of the dollar, and effectively, there’s a second risk. The first one is the deficit, the second one is effectively that the dollar is losing its status as a reserve currency… You can see the accumulation of gold in the reserves and the behavior of gold over the past 12 months. And it didn’t start with Trump’s policies. Of course, it started with Biden when he froze the accounts of people connected to Putin, and of course, thinking that it would be limited there, but people not connected to Putin decided to stay away from the euro and the dollar. And gold is effectively now the reserve currency. Transactions take place in dollars and euros, usually dollars, and at the same rate, however, they get converted back into gold. And we can see that from the accumulation of reserves.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Trump Wallets Offload TRUMP Tokens Hours Before US-Iran Clash,https://cryptopotato.com/insider-selloff-trump-wallets-offload-trump-tokens-hours-before-us-iran-clash/,"TL;DR On-chain data shared by Lookonchain shows that the Official Trump team deposited another sizeable batch of the asset to centralized exchanges yesterday. While they have done this in the past on numerous occasions, this particular transfer raises questions about inside information, as it came just hours before the US attacked Iran. The wallet linked to the #TRUMP team deposited another 3.527M $TRUMP ($32.8M) to #Binance 30 minutes ago. Since April 28, wallets linked to the #TRUMP team have deposited a total of 12.54M $TRUMP ($150.68M) to exchanges in 4 batches. https://t.co/SwzribrM5d pic.twitter.com/26IksmyHvM — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 21, 2025 It was just a few months ago when TRUMP skyrocketed as the US President invited the top 220 holders to attend a special dinner event with him in the States. Naturally, people rushed in to buy the token, which doubled in value in days and exceeded $16 in late April. However, speculators started to take profits off the table, and TRUMP corrected almost immediately. Nevertheless, it remained above $10 for the next several weeks before Israel’s attacks against Iran took place last week. The past 24 hours have been particularly brutal to altcoins as the US joined Israel in attacking Iran. This is evident by the growing bitcoin dominance , and the Official Trump meme coin has not been spared. The asset has slumped by over 6% on a daily scale and now trades well below $9. This is why many X users questioned whether the team was aware of what was to take place just hours after they transferred more than $32 million worth of TRUMP to Binance. It’s worth noting that the US President confirmed the attacks at 00:50 BST (19:50 local time) on his social media platform, Truth Social, which was several hours after the transfers to Binance.

It is currently trading at $0.01783, sitting just above the lower Bollinger Band ($0.01761), while the mid-band resistance stands at $0.01999. The RSI is at 34.05, approaching oversold territory, signaling weakening buying interest and the potential for a further decline if selling pressure continues. The trend has been consistently downward since late May, and the narrowing Bollinger Bands suggest low volatility with bearish bias. If ACH fails to hold $0.0176 support, it may retest previous lows, while recovery hinges on reclaiming $0.02 with volume. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACH/USD 4-hour chart Based on the 4-hour chart for Alchemy Pay (ACH), the outlook remains bearish. The price is trading at $0.01783, hugging the lower Bollinger Band ($0.01776), which suggests continued selling pressure. The MACD lines are flat and negative, showing weak momentum and lack of buying interest. Additionally, the Balance of Power is at -0.39, confirming bearish dominance. The asset has consistently failed to reclaim the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.01923), making resistance stronger over time. Without a decisive breakout above $0.02070, recovery remains unlikely. If $0.01776 support fails, further downside could unfold, potentially targeting the $0.01700 level or lower.

However, with the cryptocurrency market gearing up for the next bull run, attention has shifted to a new contender, Ruvi AI (RUVI) . The combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology has positioned Ruvi AI as a standout project, with analysts predicting it could easily overshadow Solana in terms of both utility and explosive returns. With its structured growth plan and impressive presale performance, many believe Ruvi AI is ready to dominate the bull run. Why Analysts Think Ruvi AI Can Outperform Solana Solana is known for its robust infrastructure and thriving developer ecosystem, but its focus remains primarily on transaction speed and scalability. In contrast, Ruvi AI broadens its appeal by addressing real-world challenges across multiple industries, such as marketing , entertainment , and finance. By combining AI with blockchain , Ruvi AI delivers innovative, scalable solutions that solve tangible problems, ensuring long-term demand for its tokens. What makes Ruvi AI particularly compelling is its structured growth path. Token prices are currently set at an extremely low $0.015 per unit during Phase 2 of its presale , offering early investors a prime opportunity. After the presale, the price is guaranteed to reach $0.07 , securing an almost 5x ROI before the token even lists publicly. Analysts project Ruvi AI could hit $1 post-listing , representing a 66x ROI for those who invest now. This planned and predictable price movement sets Ruvi AI apart from Solana, whose value heavily relies on market sentiment and competition. Record-Breaking Presale Signals Investor Confidence Ruvi AI’s presale success is proof of its potential, with staggering numbers that highlight strong investor confidence: $1.9 million raised , establishing it as one of the most successful early-stage crypto projects in 2025. Over 160 million tokens sold , demonstrating significant demand. A community of more than 1,600 holders , providing a solid base of support for the project’s mission. Unlike Solana, Ruvi AI offers a guaranteed $0.07 valuation after presale , removing speculative risks and providing clarity for investors. This transparency has played a key role in attracting both retail and institutional investors. VIP Investment Tiers Multiply Gains Ruvi AI provides early adopters with the opportunity to maximize their returns through its VIP investment tiers , which reward investors with incredible bonuses. Here’s a breakdown of the potential gains: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers significantly amplify initial investments, offering unparalleled ROI even before the token reaches public exchanges. Transparency and Security Establish Credibility Ruvi AI has taken significant steps to ensure investor trust through transparency and security. It recently underwent a third-party audit by CyberScope , a leading blockchain security firm, to validate the project’s robustness and reliability. Additionally, Ruvi AI partnered with WEEX Exchange to guarantee post-presale liquidity. Once listed, RUVI tokens will immediately become tradable, providing flexibility for investors and ensuring seamless market access. Real-World Utility Solidifies Ruvi AI’s Long-Term Value While Solana excels at throughput and infrastructure, Ruvi AI tackles wide-ranging real-world applications that ensure longevity and relevance. Here are some of the areas Ruvi AI is revolutionizing: Marketing: Empowering businesses with AI-driven tools to optimize ad targeting and improve ROI. Entertainment: Transforming creative industries with blockchain-sealed payments and AI-assisted personalized content strategies. Finance: Modernizing financial institutions with services like fraud detection, transparency upgrades, and operational scalability. This versatility makes Ruvi AI not just a cryptocurrency but a disruptive force across multiple industries. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out in the Bull Run Solana might continue to attract developers and sustain its market presence, but Ruvi AI’s combination of structured growth, innovation, and real-world applications make it a top contender for the leader of the next bull run. Its $0.015 presale price , planned $0.07 valuation post-presale , and expected $1 valuation post-listing lay out a clear path to extraordinary returns. With $1.9 million raised , 160 million tokens sold , and robust partnerships with CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is winning over analysts and investors. Don’t miss this opportunity to get in early. Ruvi AI promises rewards that few projects in the market can match.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate headlines, it's the altcoin space that could deliver outsized returns in the months ahead. In this analysis, we spotlight five altcoins currently flying under the radar but displaying strong technical setups and long-term fundamentals. From Layer-2 scaling solutions to Web3 infrastructure plays, these picks may be closer to liftoff than most expect. Arbitrum (ARB): Oversold and Primed for a Reversal Rally Source: tradingview Arbitrum is currently trading in the low $0.30s, reflecting significant pressure—but also presenting a compelling entry point for risk-tolerant investors. Down more than 60% over the last six months, ARB's RSI below 40 suggests the asset is nearing oversold territory, often a precursor to sharp rebounds. If it can break through resistance around the mid-$0.40 range, the next target could be the high $0.50s—a possible 50% gain from current levels. As Ethereum’s Layer-2 narrative continues to grow, Arbitrum’s strong fundamentals and scaling potential could drive renewed interest. A shift in sentiment might quickly flip this downtrend into a breakout. Render (RNDR): Short-Term Pressure, Long-Term Vision Intact Source: tradingview Render is currently navigating a volatile patch, trading between just over $3 and $4, but this could be a setup for accumulation rather than decline. While the price has dropped by over 10% this week and more than 35% this month, the long-term vision of powering decentralized GPU rendering remains intact. A move past the $4.50 resistance level could trigger a bullish reversal, offering more than 20% upside from today’s range. As AI and 3D content continue to dominate digital innovation, Render’s utility could spark renewed momentum once market confidence stabilizes. The fundamentals are solid—what’s missing now is a catalyst. Theta Network (THETA): Quiet Accumulation Before a Breakout? Source: tradingview Theta is trading between $0.64 and $0.80 in what looks like a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Although momentum has been modest, technicals show that a break above $0.89 could pave the way to $1.05, translating into over 30% upside from current levels. The convergence of the 10-day and 100-day moving averages near $0.66 indicates price compression—a typical setup before sharp directional moves. As demand for decentralized video delivery increases, Theta's unique infrastructure may once again capture investor attention. This sideways action could be laying the groundwork for a decisive breakout. JasmyCoin (JASMY): Climbing the Wall of Worry Source: tradingview JasmyCoin is currently trading between $0.01188 and $0.01500, showing signs of resilience even amid a 30% monthly decline. Its RSI near 48 suggests the coin is neither overbought nor oversold, meaning it’s in a critical pivot zone. A push above $0.016 could open the door to testing $0.020, which would represent a strong recovery from current levels. With its roots in IoT data privacy and partnerships in Japan, Jasmy still has an ecosystem worth watching. Once buying momentum picks up, the upside could surprise those who wrote it off too early. The Graph (GRT): Technical Weakness, Strategic Positioning Source: tradingview The Graph is currently consolidating between $0.08 and $0.10 after a near 30% drop this month, but the structure suggests a potential breakout is in sight. The RSI near 41 highlights that the asset is approaching oversold territory, a common setup for bullish reversals. If GRT breaks through the $0.11 resistance and approaches $0.13, that could yield over 30% gains from the lower range. As a leading protocol for querying blockchain data, The Graph remains a foundational tool in Web3 infrastructure. Smart investors might view this price zone as a long-term discount. Conclusion The altcoin market is no stranger to volatility, but for those who look beyond the noise, moments like these often present the best opportunities. Arbitrum, Render, Theta, JasmyCoin, and The Graph are all showing signs of underlying strength despite recent pullbacks. Whether it’s through technical breakouts or real-world utility, each project has a case for upside. As sentiment begins to shift, these coins could be among the first to catch fire—so keeping them on your radar might just pay off in a big way.

According to the lawsuit, the victim claimed the trading school introduced him to a fraudulent crypto exchange that promised him life-changing rewards for his investments only to end up scamming him. In the lawsuit filed in a federal court, the victim, Brian Firestone claimed that the Alpha Stock Investment Training Center (ASITC), which operated in downtown Denver, was in partnership with a fraudulent crypto exchange called CoinBridge Partners in Cherry Creek in the scheme. According to Firestone, he was first approached in December by a man named John Smith, who he said claimed to represent the trading school. Florida man sues crypto trading school after $860,000 loss According to Firestone, Smith offered to tutor him on the basics and in-depth technicals in crypto trading. He noted that Smith even offered him a gift of $500 to kickstart his learning process, one which was a ploy to eventually lure him into the elaborate scam. The trading school’s website, which is now defunct, lists its address as 1600 Lincoln St. The platform directed its users to carry out all their crypto trading services on CoinBridge, which claimed to have raised $10 million from 600 investors. According to Firestone, CoinBridge is a fake establishment masquerading as a real exchange. The lawsuit mentioned that ASITC allegedly used a method known as signal trading. According to the lawsuit, Firestone claimed that professors would message participants in the ASTIC classes at different times with clear trade instructions at different times. Students are then expected to follow these instructions, which end with them executing trades using their CoinBridge account. Firestone said that his initial $500 investment from the gift from Smith quickly rose to $55,000, prompting him to invest $50,000 more in January. Within weeks, his balance started reading $2 million. He didn’t hold back on his appreciation for the professor. “Professor, I must thank you,” Firestone texted Smith on Feb. 8. “My results were outstanding. Thank you for letting me in this trade today. This is so exciting!” he said. However, things started to move from good to bad for Firestone after a losing trade brought his balance back to $12,000. According to Firestone, he then wired $470,000 in cash and took a loan of $330,000 from ASITC to continue trading. He mentioned that after the influx of cash, his balance on CoinBridge read $24.5 million, until a USDT trade he carried out on March 9 failed to execute. “I can’t close it,” Firestone messaged Smith. “I ncant clpsoe it.” Firestone said it was a “system error” that caused the glitch, leading to his balance getting erased on the platform. Two days after that ordeal, he borrowed another $1 million from ASITC, bringing the total to $6.6 million. However, he was not able to repay part of the loan as ASITC allegedly shut down his account on May 1. According to the suit, Firestone is accusing ASITC, CoinBridge, Smith, and platform founder Raymond Torres of fraud, racketeering, and theft. The real CointBridge Partners in Wyoming has also denied any connection to the scam. Meanwhile, over $2.1 billion has been stolen in several crypto-related incidents since the beginning of 2025, with most of the losses tied to wallet breaches and key mismanagement, according to CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu. The trend shows that hackers and malicious actors are moving from targeting platforms in code-based hacks to users. In 2024, phishing attacks accounted for over $1 billion in losses across 300 incidents, making it the most damaging method of attack in the crypto space.
