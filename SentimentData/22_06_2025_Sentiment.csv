Investors and analysts alike are scrutinizing XRP, Solana, Aptos, and MAGACOIN FINANCE as each faces pivotal hurdles that could define their trajectory in the weeks ahead. Can they break through resistance and lead the next leg of the crypto bull run? XRP’s Legal Clarity May Be the Fuse for a Breakout XRP’s near-term trajectory is largely tied to its ongoing legal standoff with the SEC, which may finally be approaching resolution. The latest joint motion filed on June 12 hints at a potential settlement, and prediction markets now place an 88% probability on a spot XRP ETF approval by year’s end. If granted, institutional inflows could surge, with forecasts reaching up to $8 billion. Beyond the legal drama, XRP is increasingly being positioned as a serious player in global payments. Ripple leadership has set sights on capturing up to 14% of SWIFT’s transaction volume—a bold ambition, but one that signals confidence in XRP’s real-world utility. Meanwhile, XRP’s expanding DeFi footprint—such as Coinbase’s integration of wrapped XRP borrowing—is drawing fresh attention. Solana: ETF Optimism and Network Upgrades Support the Bull Case Solana’s momentum slowed recently amid a cooldown in speculative activity, but core metrics remain resilient. Trading just below resistance in the $165–$170 range, SOL’s near-term breakout potential hinges on two catalysts: the Firedancer upgrade and a pending SEC decision on a spot ETF. With Firedancer expected to dramatically boost Solana’s throughput, and a 91% estimated approval probability for its ETF application, the outlook is cautiously bullish. Analysts believe SOL could hit $220–$250 by year’s end if these factors align. Further strengthening the case is continued enterprise and institutional interest. Societe Generale’s launch of its USD CoinVertible stablecoin on Solana is a key validation of its growing ecosystem maturity, especially as traditional finance experiments with on-chain deployment. Aptos Building Quiet Strength Through Ecosystem Expansion Aptos has been quietly carving out a stronger position through a mix of acquisitions, tech upgrades, and high-profile integrations. The recent purchase of HashPalette opens doors in the Japanese market, while Chainlink, Stripe, and USDC integrations have enhanced the protocol’s utility and developer appeal. The unveiling of “Zaptos,” a pipelined blockchain architecture designed for low-latency and high throughput, adds another layer of innovation. Aptos is now actively competing with faster blockchains in gaming, DeFi, and payments. Momentum is also visible in its DeFi growth—DEX volumes recently set new records, and Aave’s deployment on Aptos testnet shows the protocol is gaining trust among major DeFi players. A pending U.S. ETF and new institutional partnerships, including support from Franklin Templeton, hint at a broader shift toward Aptos as a viable long-term bet. Why Analysts See an Asymmetric Upside Opportunity For MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines as one of the fastest-growing Project in 2025. Backed by a strong community and a scarcity-driven supply model, the project is quickly emerging as a strategic alternative for capital rotation. MAGACOIN’s locked 170 billion token supply—free from VC unlocks—has resonated with retail and crypto-native investors. The project has passed an independent smart contract audit (HashEx), and its current presale stage is seeing fast organic accumulation. Now, analysts are projecting the coin will continue the rally, projecting up to 100x ROI, and a major marketing rollout underway, MAGACOIN is being actively considered not in terms of legacy status, but in terms of future upside. Some analysts argue capital is already rotating into MAGACOIN from blue-chip altcoins, drawn by its early-stage narrative and structurally bullish setup. Final Thoughts: Rotation, Resistance, and the Road Ahead The common thread tying XRP, Solana, Aptos, and MAGACOIN is the convergence of growing futures activity, investor optimism, and powerful narratives—be it legal clarity, technological innovation, or explosive community-driven momentum. XRP and Solana are sitting on ETF-related powder kegs that could ignite massive inflows. Aptos continues to impress with quiet but deliberate expansion and infrastructure growth. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN stands out as a rising star—early in its lifecycle, yet already commanding serious attention across retail and analyst circles alike.

He argues that relying on a fiat currency he views as shaky makes little sense when a more stable asset exists. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight His comments have reignited a long‑running debate about what should sit behind digital coins that promise a steady peg. Schiff Questions Fiat Backing According to Schiff, it makes no sense to support a token pegged to a currency that can be inflated away. “I get Bitcoin, but not US dollar stablecoins,” he wrote in a social media post. He pointed out that fiat money can be printed in large amounts, while gold has a fixed supply and centuries of use as money. Schiff said gold cannot be easily devalued by inflation or reckless monetary policies. I get Bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins. If you’re going to introduce a third party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold? You get the same liquidity, but you also get a real store of value. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 19, 2025 Gold‑Backed Tokens On The Rise Based on reports, gold‑backed stablecoins are seeing more interest from investors worried about inflation and dollar weakness. Tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG) let users move digital claims on physical gold. These assets give the same quick transfers and high liquidity as dollar‑pegged coins but tie each token to real metal stored in vaults. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies Regulators across the globe are racing to establish precise regulations for stablecoin reserves. Congress members in the US are considering tighter reserve and audit requirements. Europe and Asia are creating their own regulations to achieve transparency and safeguard users. Schiff’s call for gold introduces additional context to these discussions. It could lead regulators to explore whether commodities can serve as backing for tokens under particular regimes. Market Reaction Mixed According to reports, Schiff’s tweet trended, garnering over 500,000 views within 24 hours. Crypto naysayers applauded his observation on fiat risk. Other investors cautioned that gold-backed tokens have higher fees and cumbersome custody expenses. They explained that transferring metal or establishing physical reserves introduces friction when compared with exchanging dollar-backed coins at a bank custodian. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free—Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Investors also pointed out that stablecoins are widely used in lending, trading and payments within DeFi platforms. Dollar‑pegged tokens like USDC and USDT dominate these flows because they tie directly into existing banking rails. Gold‑backed coins, by contrast, tend to be held as digital bullion rather than spent on everyday transactions.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.325 Market Cap $514.67M Trading Volume $19.34M Circulating Supply 1.58B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.3032 24-hour High $0.3386 24-hour Low $0.3232 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.42% 50-Day SMA $0.3953 14-Day RSI 36.93 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.4629 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis: FLOW remains bearish TL;DR Breakdown FLOW appears to be bearish. The MACD is negative, and the volume is low. The $0.323 support level remains critical. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW shows sustained bearish pressure As of June 21, the 1-day FLOW/USDT chart shows sustained bearish pressure. The price has dropped to $0.325, losing nearly 3% on the day. The 20-day SMA sits above at $0.359, clearly acting as resistance, and the price continues to post lower highs and lower lows. FLOW The MACD remains in negative territory, and the Balance of Power is deeply negative at -0.56, signaling that sellers are dominating. Support is currently found near $0.323, a level that briefly held today; if broken, a drop toward $0.315 could follow. Resistance is at $0.339, where the last short-term high was rejected. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: Bearish pressure holds still On the 4-hour chart, the short-term price action also reflects a downtrend. Bollinger Bands are wide, and price action is hugging the lower band, a sign of continued downward pressure. The candles are unable to hold gains above $0.330, and the price remains below the mid-band SMA at $0.339. Bearish pressure holds still Notably, On-Balance Volume (OBV) is declining, now at -41.32M, reinforcing the view that selling pressure outweighs buying interest. Even though a small green candle has appeared near $0.325, it’s not yet a confirmed reversal as momentum is still weak. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3470 SELL SMA 5 $0.3584 SELL SMA 10 $0.3594 SELL SMA 21 $0.3696 SELL SMA 50 $0.3953 SELL SMA 100 $0.3948 SELL SMA 200 $0.4629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3694 SELL EMA 5 $0.3753 SELL EMA 10 $0.3776 SELL EMA 21 $0.3843 SELL EMA 50 $0.4228 SELL EMA 100 $0.4937 SELL EMA 200 $0.5719 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW remains under strong selling pressure across both daily and 4-hour timeframes. Unless it breaks above $0.339, any small bounce is likely temporary. Right now, the trend is still downward, and the price could slip further if it fails to hold above $0.323. Momentum and volume both point to bears staying in control. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) dropped its key interest rate to 0%, and Chairman Martin Schlegel told Swiss broadcaster SRF on Saturday that monetary policy will continue to include forex actions if needed to control inflation. According to Reuters, the SNB will step in “to ensure price stability,” ignoring Washington’s recent move to add Switzerland to a watchlist for unfair currency practices. The US Treasury made that decision earlier this June, pushing Bern into a high-stakes position. If the US escalates the issue, Switzerland could face up to 31% in trade tariffs. Martin said that wouldn’t stop the bank from doing what it believes is necessary. “Switzerland and the SNB are not currency manipulators,” he said. “When we have intervened in the past, we have done it only to achieve our goal of price stability. Our motivation is not to gain an unfair advantage for Swiss exporters.” SNB cuts rates again while ignoring watchlist threat This latest rate cut, 25 basis points down to 0%, was widely expected by markets. Ahead of the decision, traders had priced in an 81% chance of it. Only 19% expected something larger. The SNB’s statement explained that “inflationary pressure has decreased compared to the previous quarter,” and the central bank “is countering the lower inflationary pressure” with its decision. Schlegel told CNBC’s Carolin Roth that while short-term drops in prices were visible, “current negative inflation for us is not a reason to lower interest rates.” What matters, he said, is the “medium term.” Even repeated negative monthly prints wouldn’t change the bank’s approach. The SNB lowered its inflation forecast for 2025. It now expects average inflation at 0.2% this year and 0.5% in 2026. The bank said the economic outlook remains uncertain and pointed to “developments abroad” as the biggest threat. It’s not the first time Switzerland has dealt with weak inflation. Similar conditions dominated the 2010s and early 2020s. Economist Charlotte de Montpellier from ING, who covers France and Switzerland , explained that the Swiss franc continues to gain strength during periods of global stress. She said this “systematically pushes down the price of imported products,” which hits the consumer price index. With Switzerland being a small economy that depends heavily on imports, CPI inflation takes a hit every time the franc strengthens. Franc’s rise fuels deflation as SNB supports new UBS capital rules To manage this, the SNB is keeping interest rates “systematically lower than elsewhere,” according to Charlotte. That approach is meant to slow the rise of the franc. Despite the cut, the Swiss currency stayed firm. After the Thursday decision, the US dollar last traded flat against it. The SNB’s aggressive monetary actions are paired with support for stricter rules on UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank. Martin backed new government proposals that could force UBS to hold an extra $26 billion in core capital. He said, “This is not a radical solution. Everyone has an interest in UBS doing well, that UBS is a strong bank, and that UBS is also a bank that is strongly capitalised and well prepared in terms of liquidity.” Martin also mentioned past discussions with US officials when Switzerland landed on the watchlist before. He said there was a “very good” understanding of why the country had been active in the forex space. If the country ends up staying on the list again, he said it would just lead to “further dialogue.” While other central banks are focused on fighting inflation, Switzerland is managing the opposite. Deflation is back, and the SNB is using every tool available — interest rates, market interventions, and bank capital rules — to keep control. And whether the Oval likes it or not, the SNB isn’t backing down.

Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law on June 21, 2025, creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and making Texas the third U.S. state to do so. Gov. Abbott received SB 21 on June 1, 2025, and had until June 22, 2025, to sign or veto it. Under the Texas Constitution, a bill left unsigned by that date becomes law automatically. With SB 21 now signed, Texas has now become the third state to approve a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after Arizona and New Hampshire. Source: Legiscan.com Under SB 21 , the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage a fund kept outside the state treasury. It will be funded by legislative appropriations, dedicated fees, investment returns, and voluntary cryptocurrency gifts. The law sets rules on how the comptroller can buy, hold, and sell digital assets. Supporters say it will help guard against inflation, boost the state’s financial strength, and keep Texas ahead in digital asset use. Texas Bitcoin Reserve focuses on stability with market cap threshold The law only lets the fund invest in cryptocurrencies that have had an average market cap of at least $500 billion in the past 12 months. That rule is meant to keep the fund focused on large, stable coins—currently, that is mainly Bitcoin. Since its first draft, SB 21 was revised in the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency. The most recent version adds clearer guidelines, new risk controls, and limits the comptroller’s power over speculative spending of public money. Earlier, Texas also approved House Bill 4488. That law prevents any funds set aside for a future Bitcoin reserve from being swept into the general revenue fund. It created the legal basis for holding digital assets under state law. While HB 4488 protects the reserve funds, SB 21 is the law that actually lets the state create the reserve. It allows the comptroller to use surplus general revenue to buy digital assets with a market value of at least $600 billion, a threshold met only by Bitcoin today.

With a noticeable uptick in developer activity and signs of quiet institutional accumulation, Solana is beginning to show the early signs of a potential rebound. But while Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, a different name is starting to dominate crypto watchlists, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at $0.03, MUTM is catching fire in crypto news today thanks to its razor-sharp DeFi focus. Already, more than $10.9 million has been raised in the presale, with 12,300 early investors participating so far. Already being hyped as the best crypto to buy in 2025, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the top token you might regret ignoring this summer. Mutuum Finance Presale Exceeds $10.9M, Attracts More Than 12,300 Investors Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the most promising players in the DeFi ecosystem with its presale surging over $10.9 million and attracting more than 12,300 investors on board early. The buzz surrounding the project is gaining momentum, and this is a very good indication of the project’s future. In the current stage of Phase 5, MUTM tokens have reached the price of $0.03, but it won’t last long Stage 6 will put the price at $0.035. Demand is growing exponentially and the first-mover advantage in the decentralized lending space that Mutuum Finance has is even more precious as it stands to be one of the best early-stage DeFi investments of 2025. $100,000 MUTM Giveaway: 10 Participants to Win $10K Mutuum Finance is a new protocol eager to reward the first supporters it has on its platform and has opened a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be selected and offered $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This campaign will be an acknowledgment of the rapidly expanding community in the project as well as gratitude to the initial investors. However, the clock is ticking. Do not lose the opportunity to be one of the winners and at the same time gaining a stake as one of the most discussed new projects in DeFi. Built to Trust, Assisted by Transparency The majority of DeFi projects fail as they are not practicing what their preach promises, but Mutuum Finance is demonstrating strength by showing actual credibility and infrastructure. Platform smart contracts have undergone fully audited on CertiK which is a highly renowned name in the field of blockchain security. Such a third-party audit strengthens the foundation of Mutuum Finance on reliability to security and transparency in the long run. But Mutuum Finance is also building an Ethereum-based fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that will provide price stability, high liquidity, and smooth integration among DeFi applications. For retail and institutional use, this stablecoin will be the anchor of a stable, secure financial infrastructure far into the future.

Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is attracting the attention of traders, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts alike. Notably, market watchers are betting big, predicting bold projections of up to 23,800% return on investment. Bitcoin and Cardano Stuck in the Middle Bitcoin has seen volatility in June, fluctuating between $101,000 and $112,000. After a brief decline to $101,000 amid geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, BTC rebounded above $105,000. However, the broader outlook remains cautious. BTC 1-month price chart- source CoinGecko Analysts have put the limelight on the mounting global uncertainties, including Federal Reserve rate decisions and ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran. Notably, this has turned BTC into more of a hedge than a growth vehicle. Despite heightened acceptance in corporate institutions, like GameStop’s recent capital allocation to BTC, skepticism remains high. Notably, a drop below the $100K mark could quickly sour sentiment and trigger a wave of sell-offs among risk-averse investors. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, is navigating a different kind of turbulence. As of mid-June, ADA is trading between $0.61 and $0.78, but most recently fell over 6% to around $0.6412 after failing to break key resistance levels at $0.68. Internal governance debates and ongoing ecosystem upgrades are keeping the community engaged, but the upward price momentum has left many retail investors uncertain. While Cardano’s commitment to decentralization, interoperability, and DeFi remains strong, the token’s performance has not been motivating for short-term speculators looking for big gains. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is The Breakout Opportunity of 2025. With the top-tier tokens consolidating, eyes are now turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, an explosive new entry that’s quickly becoming known as the ultimate 2025 investor Pick. Notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a top analyst’s choice. Market pundits have made projections as high as 23,800% ROI, and the early metrics support this bullish case. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart due to its capped supply model, which introduces built-in scarcity. Additionally, the project has taken a prudent step forward which is highly attractive to long-term investors. Notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone a full audit by HashEx. The audit revealed no stealth minting features, and no security vulnerabilities, ensuring maximum transparency and investor protection. The excitement around MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by large-scale buyer, strong on-chain engagement, and a surging online community. Early investors are doubling down on the asset. Final Verdict Bitcoin and Cardano are currently facing hurdles. Both cryptocurrencies are struggling with macroeconomic headwinds, including persistent inflation, and rising interest rates. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently demonstrating impressive upward momentum.This surge is fueled by a wholesome combination of factors, including robust investor confidence and a compelling growth narrative.

The victim, a 56-year-old man and a father of a well-known crypto investor, was abducted from his home in Saint-Genis-Pouilly, close to the French-Swiss border. The case has caused people to worry about the safety of crypto executives and their families in Europe and around the world. French Police Identified Suspects After Months of Investigation The kidnapping happened on the night of December 31, 2024, when five masked people broke into the family’s home. Armed and aggressive, the attackers beat the man and his wife before placing a call to their intended target, the couple’s son, to demand a ransom. When the payment could not be secured, the attackers fled the scene with the father, leaving his wife tied up in the home. Days later, police found the man locked in the trunk of a car nearly 450 miles away. He had been assaulted and soaked in petrol. According to a local news outlet, police have arrested five people in connection with the crime. The suspects are four adults aged 18 to 22 and one 17-year-old. They all have long criminal histories, including theft and drug crimes. Police have not shared the crypto investor’s name. They only said he was well-known to the public for his success, making him and his family a target. A Growing Threat in the Crypto World This case is not an isolated event. France has seen a sharp rise in crimes targeting people in the crypto industry . According to Binance, France and the United States are currently the two countries with the highest number of crypto-related kidnappings. Across Southeast Asia and Latin America, similar cases are being reported. One high-profile incident involved a Russian crypto couple kidnapped in Argentina. The suspects in that case are still at large, and international efforts are ongoing to locate them. Crypto Investors Respond With Security Measures As these incidents become more frequent, crypto millionaires and executives are hiring bodyguards from private security firms and reducing their public exposure. The Paymium kidnapping case, another recent event in France, shows just how serious this problem is becoming. French police are still investigating the latest case and are warning crypto enthusiasts to be careful about their safety. As cryptocurrencies become more valuable and popular, they also draw dangerous attention. The arrests in France show progress, but the overall risk remains.

Chainlink (LINK): Powering Real-World Data for Smart Contracts Chainlink (LINK) remains one of the best crypto coins to buy now because of its core role as a leading oracle network in blockchain. It helps smart contracts access real-world data securely and accurately, allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to function beyond on-chain limits. This makes Chainlink a key part of the growing DeFi sector and keeps it ahead in its field. Currently priced around $15.42, LINK has shown consistent strength in the market. The project is widely adopted across multiple blockchains and continues forming new partnerships to improve its reach. Chainlink’s vital role in enabling smart contracts and its long-term utility make it a strong option. It continues to stand out among the best crypto coins to buy now for anyone looking to broaden their crypto exposure. 3. Avalanche (AVAX): Fast Network with Growing Adoption Avalanche (AVAX) is now a leading choice for running decentralized apps due to its fast and scalable blockchain. With the ability to process more than 4,500 transactions per second, it’s one of the most efficient platforms out there. Its consensus model helps the network remain secure while handling high-speed traffic, making it a useful option for future DeFi and Web3 services. At $21.12 per token, AVAX offers a chance to enter a growing ecosystem. The platform’s low transaction fees and fast performance continue to attract builders and new projects. With more apps launching on Avalanche, its usage is increasing. Those looking for speed and scale will find AVAX among the best crypto coins to buy now. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Making Blockchains Work Together Polkadot (DOT) stands out as one of the best crypto coins to buy now because of its approach to blockchain communication. It solves a big problem by letting different blockchains interact easily through a shared system. Its multichain setup gives developers the tools to create their own chains that work together in a single network, which is ideal for dApps and DeFi platforms. Trading at $4.12, Polkadot is well-positioned for growth as the need for connected blockchains increases. Its parachain model links various networks, helping developers build new tools with more flexibility. As blockchain use expands, Polkadot’s role in creating a connected ecosystem becomes more important. It’s a solid pick among the best crypto coins to buy now. Final Thoughts on These Crypto Picks Exploring the best crypto coins to buy now can help uncover future leaders in blockchain. From BlockDAG’s efficient design to Chainlink’s oracle support, Avalanche’s high-speed network, and Polkadot’s cross-chain focus, each project offers real strengths. These features set them apart in a competitive space. As crypto continues to grow, these coins are gaining attention for their strong tech and rising adoption. They’re not just building for today but helping shape the next phase of blockchain. For those planning ahead in crypto, these names deserve a close look.

Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies use substantial electricity to validate their ecosystems. In April 2024, the Norwegian government announced plans to restrict data centres to focus resources on more productive forms of work. Norway’s digitisation Minister, Karianne Tung, said the initiative aimed to control and limit undesirable projects such as crypto mining. Terje Aasland, Energy Minister for Norway, said that the main impetus for temporarily banning crypto mining data centres was meeting the nation’s climate targets. Aasland said crypto mining was incompatible with the government’s climate targets because the technology uses excess electricity and doesn’t contribute meaningfully to the nation’s long-term investments. Norway has a history of cracking down on crypto mining. In 2022, the government proposed ending tax incentives for the crypto mining industry, forcing the sector to pay the standard rate for electricity. Trygve Slagsvold, Finance Minister for Norway, said the move was about prioritising energy to benefit the whole community. Slagsvold pointed out that crypto does little to help the local community, yet uses tremendous energy. Norway has been an attractive destination for Bitcoin miners because it powers its grid with 92% of its energy from hydropower. Another 7% of energy is powered by wind sources, making the country an incredibly resourceful economy as far as climate targets are concerned. However, this is not enough for the Norwegian government because it is concerned about the long-term viability of crypto mining. Residents of Hadsel, a Norwegian province, petitioned the government in October 2024 to shut down a local Bitcoin mine. Yet, they suffered a rude shock when their electricity prices skyrocketed due to energy companies accounting for lost revenue. Venture capitalists quickly pointed out that residents suffered when the government targeted Bitcoin. However, the mayor of Hadsel, Kjell-Borge Freiberg, said that residents had been complaining about the noise emanating from the Bitcoin mining data centre. The Bitcoin mining operations produced 20% of the energy company’s revenue. When the Bitcoin mine was shut down, the energy company passed on its lost revenue to consumers. It is also possible that the energy company is punishing the residents for disrupting its bottom line. The energy company, however, may lament that one customer could disrupt their business model by shutting down operations. It is estimated that residents of Hadsel, due to the closure of the mine, will pay an extra $235 to $280 on their annual electricity bill. Russia implemented a mining ban on ten regions, including ones that already experienced a vulnerable energy grid. Many countries, such as Norway, are taking a critical stance towards crypto mining, at times for meeting climate targets, while at other times to restrict the spread of anonymous currencies. Energy-rich countries, such as Norway, are budgeting their energy use to prioritise their grid for what they believe are more productive industries. Miners must either remain in the country, invest in low-power consumables, or relocate to another country. There is also the option to switch completely to proof-of-stake methods to appease the Norwegian government and make a profit at the same time. In 2024, Norway first attempted to scrutinize the crypto mining industry by announcing a new set of regulations to shape the market in a way that they felt was appropriate, specifically to adhere to their climate change targets and beliefs about sustainability. The new regulations started this process by requiring all data centres engaged in crypto mining to register their activities. The Norwegian government, however, is adamant that the regulations were not intended to punish the crypto industry but were designed to better align the industry with national targets.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Norway,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-21 22:14:04

Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $2,391 Market Cap $305.82M Trading Volume (24h) $40.64B Circulating Supply 120.7M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24-hour High $2,448.41 24-hour Low $2,382.26 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility 2.49% 50-day SMA $2,300.76 200-day SMA $2,420.46 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 62 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 14-day RSI 52.65 Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-day chart Based on the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) for June 21, current price action suggests a weakening bullish structure. ETH has broken below the middle line of the Bollinger Bands, indicating potential bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 40.60, near the oversold territory, and is trending downward, reflecting weakening buying pressure. Price has also fallen under the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), now acting as resistance around $2,560. Unless buyers reclaim this level, ETH may test lower Bollinger support near $2,346. Momentum is tilting bearish, and without a reversal above $2,560, short-term downside risk remains dominant on the daily timeframe. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart Based on the 4-hour chart for Ethereum (ETH), the outlook currently skews bearish. The price has fallen below the lower Bollinger Band near $2,381, which could signal oversold conditions but also reflects intensified selling pressure. The MACD indicator is deeply negative, with the MACD line at -8.45 and a wide gap from the signal line, suggesting strong bearish momentum. Moreover, the Balance of Power indicator at -0.87 further confirms dominant selling activity. Unless ETH reclaims the midline around $2,483 and sustains a move above it, the near-term trend remains under pressure, with potential to revisit the $2,300–$2,350 support zone.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of bearish momentum, with prices retreating below significant support levels. On the 1-day chart, the RSI is declining and now hovering near the 40 level, indicating fading bullish strength and possible continuation of downward pressure. The Bollinger Bands show price action testing the lower band, suggesting volatility and weakness. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD is deeply negative with widening bearish histograms, confirming ongoing sell-side dominance. Unless ETH reclaims the $2,500 range with strong volume, the short-term trajectory remains cautious, with potential dips toward the $2,300 support region. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,458 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $38,085, maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with its potential low starting at $10,333 and a high of $12,545 Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029 and reach a potential high of $26,554. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $56,126 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $56,126 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum At ETHGlobal, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin emphasized the urgent need for privacy solutions, urging developers to focus on four critical areas: private money, identity, voting, and messaging. He framed privacy as a civilizational priority, encouraging the ecosystem to build tools that safeguard individual autonomy in an increasingly digital world. ""On a civilizational level, there's quite alot of urgency in us figuring out privacy."" @VitalikButerin urges builders at ETHGlobal to focus on 4 key categories of privacy apps to help solve for this: 1) private money 2) private identity 3) private voting 4) private messaging pic.twitter.com/1x49zNiVZm — ETHGlobal (@ETHGlobal) May 30, 2025 Ethereum announced that its much-anticipated network upgrade, Pectra, is coming to Mainnet on May 7th.

Vitalik Buterin’s RISC-V plan might make Ethereum’s technical infrastructure stronger, which could bring in more developers and make it easier to scale. But the sudden drop in base layer activity and gas costs that are lower than they’ve ever been raise doubts about how many people want to utilize the network and how long it will last. Ethereum might pick up speed again if it successfully executes protocol changes and Layer 2 solutions become more popular. Changes in the broader crypto market, new rules, and the adoption of crypto by businesses will also be very important. Ethereum’s price path in 2025 is still unclear and will be affected by both internal and external market factors, even if it has room to develop. Ethereum’s price outlook remains optimistic, with projections suggesting the potential for new all-time highs, possibly reaching near $6,000, driven by adoption, innovation, and network growth. However, external economic uncertainties or unfavorable conditions could press ETH prices toward an annual low of $4,825, with average estimates based on market sentiment hovering around $5,458.

This article explores how Ondo (ONDO) , Maker (MKR) , and others are poised for potential growth, reshaping the financial landscape. Ondo Price Snapshot Amid Altcoin Season and Global Bull Outlook ONDO recent performance reflects a sharp decline, with a one-week drop of 6.81% and a one-month fall of 23.82%. The half-year performance shows a significant decrease of about 54.05%. These numbers indicate a consistent downward movement in recent periods. The price behavior portrays a market that has struggled to recover, with traders witnessing a steady deterioration and clear corrections over time. The shifts in price have been considerable, signaling a need for cautious observation as market dynamics continue to evolve. Current price levels range from $0.70 to $1.05, with resistance at $1.27 and support at $0.57. A secondary barrier exists at $1.62, while another support level is noted at $0.21. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator near -0.100 and -0.123 suggest active selling, reinforcing a bearish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index at 37.25 hints at potential oversold conditions but does not confirm a strong rally. Trading ideas may focus on short-term pauses at $0.57 or potential reversal signs if the price breaches $1.27. With bears dominating and volatility high, any move above key resistance could signal a cautious entry for bulls aiming to restructure the current downtrend. Maker Market Outlook: Steady Half-Year Growth Amid Key Price Levels Maker saw a 6.54% gain over the past month and a notable 17.23% climb in the last six months. A recent drop of 14.15% highlights short-term volatility, yet the longer-term trend remains positive. The coin traded consistently between $1340 and $1880, demonstrating gradual strength over time. Price action reflects moments of pressure followed by recovery, suggesting a market capable of bouncing back after downturns while slowly building upward momentum. Currently, Maker is trading with significant barriers in view. There is clear support around $1111.33 and resistance at approximately $2191.33. The price is fluctuating within these defined bounds. Buyers are active near the support threshold, while sellers resist near the resistance level, indicating a balance between bulls and bears. Trading within these parameters appears promising. Pullbacks near support may offer entry points, while approaching resistance could signal taking profits. Additional levels, such as a second resistance near $2731.33 and second support near $571.33, add further caution. Moving indicators suggest a careful approach, requiring tactical entries based on real-time price behavior. IOTA Faces Significant Drops and Key Technical Levels IOTA lost nearly 29% of its value over the past month and almost 45% over the last six months. Its recent performance includes a weekly drop of about 6.51%, emphasizing persistent bearish pressure. The price action during these periods indicates an overall decline, with selling pressure consistently exceeding buying interest. Investors have shown increased caution as market momentum has slowed. Historical data suggests diminished investor sentiment and a trend primarily characterized by declines, making it a challenging environment for any bullish opportunities. IOTA is currently trading in a range between $0.14 and $0.24, with a resistance zone at $0.31 and another barrier near $0.41. The nearest support level is around $0.10, with a secondary support at $0.00046. Technical indicators reveal a continued bearish dominance, as shown by an Awesome Oscillator value of -0.026, a momentum indicator at -0.028, and an RSI of 34.89. The lack of a clear trend means the coin is likely to remain within these boundaries. Trading strategies should focus on cautiously building positions near support at $0.10 and considering profit-taking near resistance at $0.31. Conclusion Ondo (ONDO) , Maker (MKR) , and IOTA offer distinct solutions in the expanding field of real-world asset platforms. Each has its own strengths, showcasing innovation and practical applications. Ondo focuses on secure and profitable financial services. Maker leads in stability and decentralized finance. IOTA brings new efficiency in transactions. Together, they illustrate the versatile potential of blockchain technology in real-world contexts.

But prominent attorney Bill Morgan has publicly cast doubt on these rumors. Is The US Planning To Seize Ripple’s Escrowed XRP? According to widely followed crypto analyst John Squire, the United States government could potentially take control of the XRP tokens currently held in Ripple’s escrow. This revelation comes at a significant time, following President Donald Trump’s previous confirmation of plans to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile holding cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple’s XRP. However, Bill Morgan refuted claims that the US government intends to utilize XRP as part of a broader strategy to support its financial system. “No it won’t,” Morgan asserted in a post on X. Another industry commentator, going by the online alias Pumpius , also informed his X followers about the rumors about the US authorities potentially repurposing Ripple’s XRP escrow as part of the national financial reserves. Pumpius compared the XRP scenario to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were once considered unlikely but ultimately became a reality, indicating that the Ripple-affiliated crypto could make its way to US reserves. Notably, the longstanding Ripple vs SEC lawsuit is nearing its conclusion, spurring optimism within the community. Regulatory clarity on XRP’s legal status is stirring speculation about its potential inclusion. A host of companies have in recent months announced reserves of the Ripple-created cryptocurrency. Singapore-based Web3 company Trident Digital announced it will start a strategic XRP treasury of up to $500 million. Others like Webus, VivoPower, and Wellgistics have also announced XRP-centric reserves. These moves are indicative of growing institutional interest in Ripple’s XRP ecosystem. While Ripple’s technology is gaining traction among corporations, claims related to US reserves remain unsubstantiated.

They’re moving capital now into high-potential presales with real utility, strong fundamentals, and explosive upside. Several projects have emerged as strategic picks, but one name is standing out across every analyst report and trading desk. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining momentum as the most anticipated altcoin of the year. Backed by strong fundamentals, a fully audited framework, and a live ecosystem, this project is now being tracked as a breakout leader in 2025. Early movers are already locking in positions before prices lift off. Here are the top presales to watch before the next parabolic rally begins. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE has the Upper Hand in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as one of the most watched altcoins of 2025. With a bold vision, aggressive rollout, and unmatched market presence, this project is capturing early attention from crypto insiders and strategic investors looking for serious upside. Analysts tracking top altcoins refer to it as a breakout contender, citing its fixed supply, governance model, and fully organic ownership as key differentiators. The fundamentals are already functioning while the broader market is still waking up. Investor demand is also climbing fast. With each presale milestone filled in record time, MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as a strategic opportunity for long-term crypto holders and institutional buyers alike. Its momentum is organic, its structure lean, and its entry point remains one of the most asymmetric opportunities available in today’s market. Qubetics: Powering Interoperability Across Chains Qubetics is another standout contender gaining massive traction. Its ecosystem is built for next-generation blockchain applications, combining real-world asset tokenization with no-code development tools. With advanced cross-chain capabilities, support for multichain wallets, and seamless Apple Pay integration, Qubetics is proving it can drive mass adoption beyond crypto-native users. Analysts are forecasting a breakout, especially as its mainnet rollout completes and key features like decentralized VPN and fractional ownership marketplaces go live. Institutional-grade infrastructure and simplified onboarding are giving it long-term relevance. No wonder large investors are already rotating into Qubetics with aggressive positioning ahead of its post-launch trading. With a full mainnet launch slated for Q2 2025 and a streamlined bridge system in place, analysts expect significant ROI for those who got in early. Insider sentiment remains strong, with projections reaching over 5,000% in potential gains. BlockDAG: Utility Meets Momentum BlockDAG continues to post powerful numbers, attracting attention for its real-time staking access, airdrop incentives, and massive presale traction. Unlike speculative tokens, BlockDAG emphasizes live blockchain usage through its X1 Miner App, enabling users to earn and engage daily.

Lightchain AI: The AI-Blockchain Fusion Lightchain AI is rewriting the script for what blockchain can do with artificial intelligence. Its Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) model rewards real computational work instead of idle staking. That means every token earned comes from real utility, not idle inflation. The upcoming mainnet will activate a purpose-built AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), designed to run parallelized tasks at scale. Analysts are watching closely. Early signals show Lightchain AI attracting long-term investors looking for ROI potential. From staking rewards to a transparent DAO structure, Lightchain AI is capturing aggressive capital—and insiders are forecasting it as one of the top “risk-on” plays of the cycle. Ruvi AI: Real-World Utility at Scale Ruvi AI is earning a reputation as one of the most utility-focused AI tokens on the market. Operating across marketing, entertainment, and finance sectors, it merges artificial intelligence with blockchain for scalable, real-world applications. Its smart contract audit and liquidity partner support position it well for long-term sustainability. Projections for this token range up to $1, with analysts forecasting a good potential ROI by the end of 2025 — a serious move for those betting early on next-gen AI platforms. Final Word The 2025 bull market is shaping up to be one of the most transformative cycles in crypto history. Projects with strong fundamentals, early adoption, and real-world traction are already gaining serious momentum, and MAGACOIN FINANCE in front.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has restricted electronic vehicle manufacturers’ access to a material essential to their technology: cobalt. Today’s development is the latest in a familiar theme of trade wars spreading across different sectors. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the world’s leading producer of cobalt, and as such, the move spells uncertainty for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. Congo’s cobalt export ban remains in place Congo’s mineral regulatory agency made the announcement on Saturday. The industry is currently experiencing a crisis as global cobalt prices remain in decline. Miners are currently divided over how to navigate the growing stockpile. The original four-month export suspension was imposed in February 2025 to curb an oversupply of cobalt, a critical component in lithium-ion batteries used in EVs, smartphones, and other high-tech devices. The initial ban was set to expire on June 23, but the new extension will run until September, keeping roughly 70% of the world’s cobalt production largely unavailable to global markets. “The decision has been taken to extend the temporary suspension due to the continued high level of stock on the market,” the Authority for the Regulation and Control of Strategic Mineral Substances’ Markets (ARECOMS) said in a statement. #RDC_MINES | COMMUNIQUÉ Prolongation de la suspension temporaire de l’exportation du Cobalt. pic.twitter.com/S8XyZPLKDL — Ministère des Mines – RDC (@MinMinesRDC) June 21, 2025 Congo’s ARECOMS expects its market intervention to stabilize cobalt prices, which fell to a nine-year low of $10 per pound earlier this year. Cobalt miners are divided on cobalt control strategy Congo’s latest move has sparked disagreement among the industry’s biggest players, including Glencore and CMOC Group. These companies are the world’s top two cobalt producers, and they are currently on opposite sides in terms of how to move forward. Congolese authorities have been considering implementing a system of export quotas that would limit how much cobalt each mining company can ship abroad once the ban is eventually lifted. The proposal is still under review, but it appears to have gained traction with Glencore, an Anglo-Swiss mining and commodities giant. The company believes a quota-based system is a way to better manage supply and pricing. However, CMOC Group, China’s state-backed mining conglomerate, is lobbying for the immediate removal of the export ban altogether. CMOC argues that the continued suspension will distort global markets, undermine long-term supply relationships, and could damage the reputation of Congolese cobalt as a reliable input for EV manufacturers and tech firms. This is especially important as major automakers are currently ramping up EV production in an effort to meet their ambitious climate targets. These companies require stable and ethical sources of battery materials. Disruptions in cobalt supply can lead to delays in battery manufacturing, increase costs, and force companies to seek alternative methods that rely less heavily on cobalt. Already, several battery producers have begun transitioning toward nickel-rich or cobalt-free technologies. This change is partly due to ethical concerns tied to artisanal mining in the DRC, and now because of price volatility and regulatory unpredictability. The extended Congolese export ban is expected to tighten global cobalt availability further, potentially driving prices upward in the second half of the year if stockpiles begin to shrink. Some analysts believe the DRC’s move may encourage speculative hoarding or opportunistic deals with buyers willing to pay a premium for early access once exports resume. For now, ARECOMS has said it will issue a final decision to either modify, lift, or further extend the suspension before the new three-month period ends in September. “We will continue monitoring stock levels and market conditions and will provide further guidance before the current extension expires,” an agency spokesperson said.

XRP is pushing forward amid regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing resilience with deep ecosystem development and high-stakes whale activity. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the playbook on community-driven tokens with a rapidly growing presence and fixed-supply economics. XRP Legal Saga and a Fractal-Led Forecast to $15 XRP has once again had some progress in the ongoing legal saga with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The recent joint motion to dissolve the court’s longstanding injunction and the finalized $50 million settlement is an important point. SEC had dropped its lawsuit earlier this year, and Judge Torres’ decision on the final settlement motion is an outcome that could affect XRP-spot ETF approvals. Technical analysts are turning increasingly bullish. Forecasts range from targets of $5 to $15, with historical fractals from XRP’s 2017 breakout playing a central role in current models. Bitget and Standard Chartered continue to point to mid- and long-term upside, suggesting room for significant growth. At the same time, institutional adoption is quietly gaining pace. BitGo’s $100 million XRP position for VivoPower underscores the token’s appeal as a treasury asset. Meanwhile, upgrades to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) are making cross-border payments and DeFi applications more accessible than ever. Shiba Inu Ecosystem Upgrades Amid Whale-Fueled Accumulation Despite a recent price decline in line with broader market weakness, Shiba Inu remains a project worth watching. The token is showing increased accumulation from large holders, with over 15 trillion SHIB moving into whale wallets in just one day—the largest spike in six months. The SHIB ecosystem is quietly evolving in ways that could reshape its market perception. The Shibarium Layer-2 solution is advancing in adoption, designed to lower gas costs and boost speed for transactions. Meanwhile, the rollout of ShibDAO and the new Shib Alpha Layer signals an ambitious roadmap focused on governance, staking, and privacy-enhanced scalability. The derivatives market paints a mixed picture, with long liquidations suggesting caution. However, on-chain activity tells a different story: increased whale participation, a stable support level around $0.00001100, and long-term holders continuing to engage with the network. Why Investors Don’t Want to Miss Out on MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE project is turning heads across both retail and institutional segments. Analysts now consistently list it for its disruptive potential. The appeal is multi-layered: a fixed supply that encourages scarcity-based accumulation and a strong cultural identity that has catalyzed viral momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built tangible utility into its ecosystem. On the other hand, HashEx-audited smart contracts and 100% community ownership establish credibility and transparency. With mounting speculation around major exchange listings and visible wallet activity indicating high retention and repeat buyers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a standout performer heading into Q3. Its presale—described by analysts as a “strategic accumulation phase”—is an opportunity to enter early before the project broadens into public markets. MAGACOIN’s fundamentals and structure are increasingly difficult to ignore. Final Thoughts The crypto market is volatile and narratives evolve overnight, but the key is to know what to expect. XRP, SHIB, and MAGACOIN FINANCE each represent unique altcoin cases. As Q3 2025 approaches, these are not coins to watch casually—they’re the ones smart investors are already moving on. It could be XRP for its potential for explosive upside post-regulatory resolution or SHIB, which is quite resilient, backed by real infrastructure. MAGACOIN has established itself as part of the next leg of the crypto cycle.

Notably, the altcoin has been a major headliner amidst a general crypto market correction in the past one month. During this period, XRP prices have dipped by over 10% with current market prices around $2.13. While crypto enthusiasts remain hopeful of market resurgence, Coin Bureau’s recent revelations shows that on-chain data suggests otherwise. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy XRP $3 Target Impossible Amid Declining Network Activity – Analyst According to an X post by Coin Bureau on June 20, XRP is facing an uphill task in regaining its bullish form due to network engagement crises. Notably, data from Glassnode shows that new wallets on the XRP Ledger have crashed from above 30,000 new addresses daily in January to presently below 5,000 new addresses daily. Interestingly, the chart by Glassnode presents a strong correlation between price action and network growth. The surge in wallet creation during late Q4 2024 was accompanied by a parabolic move in price that brought XRP to trade as high as $2.71. However, as the rate of new users entering the network began to decline, XRP’s price action also entered a consolidation and gradual downward trend. Amidst other developments, Coin Bureau also highlights XRP’s daily active addresses has experienced a staggering drop from 557,000 to 34,000 to further suggest a lack of retail investor interest in the XRP ecosystem. According to the market analyst, the glaring fall in network engagement indicates XRP may lack sufficient market demand to support a bullish climb towards the $3 price region which is a crucial resistance zone. However, other analysts have presented an alternative theory. In particular, a market expert with X pseudonym MoonLambo explains the previous highs in network activity seen in Q4 2024 and January coincided with a period of widespread market greed following the US general elections. The analyst claims the decline is normal alongside social trends rather and is overemphasized by Coin Bureau.

Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 22.29% and valued at $2.25 billion. According to data from prediction site CoinCodex, XRP Investors still remain largely bearish but the Fear & Greed Index stands neutral at 54. CoinCodex analysts are predicting XRP to remain in consolidation for the short term with predictions of $2.12 in one month. However, they forecast a steady long-term bullish revival with projections of $2.45 in three months and $3.03 in six months.

But a few names are beginning to stand out, fast. BlockDAG, Stellar (XLM), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Solana (SOL) are emerging as some of the fastest-growing cryptos, each with a different strength pulling them forward. BlockDAG is rewriting how blockchain scales. Stellar is inching deeper into institutional finance. Shiba Inu continues to prove it’s more than a meme. And Solana, once doubted, now leads the Layer 1 conversation. Here’s a breakdown of where each one is heading, and why they deserve attention in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Disrupting Blockchain Performance With Parallel Power BlockDAG isn’t trying to follow the old rules, it’s rewriting them. While other chains move block by block, BlockDAG lets validators process multiple blocks at once, unlocking massive gains in scalability. Its parallel processing model pushes decentralisation forward while tackling delays and inefficiencies. It’s already making bold claims, and backing them. This is the fastest Proof-of-Work model running right now, confirming 10 blocks per second with goals to hit over 100 in the near future. But it’s not just about speed. BlockDAG is pushing hard on adoption too, with tools like its no-code dApp builder, token creator, and mobile mining app X1, now with more than 2 million users on board. Add to that $315 million raised in presale, over 23 billion BDAG coins sold, and a 2,660% increase from $0.001 to $0.0276 across 29 batches. For a limited time, buyers can still get in at $0.0020. With a mainnet launch around the corner, and hints at major U.S. sponsorships, BlockDAG is more than promising, it’s one of the fastest-growing cryptos making real moves. 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community Power Meets Ecosystem Growth Dismissed early as just another meme coin, Shiba Inu has steadily turned the tide. Currently priced at $0.00001172, it might not look like much on the surface, but its burn rate is accelerating fast, removing millions of tokens from circulation and reducing supply. Shibarium, its layer-2 solution, is expanding steadily, bringing new wallet activity and ecosystem tools. What’s making SHIB stand out in 2025 isn’t hype, it’s the work being done underneath. The community is highly engaged, and its utility is growing. In a market driven by loyalty and volume, SHIB continues to evolve, securing its spot among the fastest-growing cryptos this year. 3. Stellar (XLM): Quietly Building a Bridge to Big Finance Stellar isn’t making headlines every day, but it probably should be. Trading at $0.25, XLM has had its share of volatility, but the moves behind the scenes are what matter most. Its recent addition to the Nasdaq Crypto Index and ties with institutions like Franklin Templeton signal a serious shift in perception. It’s not just a payment network anymore, it’s a bridge between decentralised finance and the old world of traditional finance. With continued upgrades to improve performance and security, Stellar is shaping itself into an enterprise-ready blockchain. If you’re tracking quiet contenders with long-term reach, Stellar belongs on the list of fastest-growing cryptos to consider. 4. Solana (SOL): Powering Web3 at Lightning Speed Solana has taken its fair share of hits, but it continues to rise. Trading between $144 and $154, SOL now supports more than 11.6 million wallets. Its ecosystem is thriving, DeFi, NFTs, games, and payments are all being built and scaled on Solana faster than on most networks. Yes, resistance at key price levels has slowed momentum, but upcoming launches like the Solaxy ICO could reignite the rally. Solana’s low fees and high throughput keep developers locked in and activity high. With network speed and developer commitment on its side, Solana is still one of the fastest-growing cryptos as we move closer to 2025. 4 Contenders, One Market on the Move Heading into 2025, the crypto market isn’t short on bold ideas, but only a few are showing real execution. BlockDAG’s technology, combined with strong funding and public adoption, places it at the front. Stellar’s quiet integration into traditional finance gives it staying power. Shiba Inu proves what a motivated community can build, and Solana continues to lead where speed and scalability matter. Each of these fastest-growing cryptos is carving its own path. Whether you want infrastructure, innovation, community, or performance, these four bring it all to the table. The next bull run might not wait, so neither should your research.

This zone, referred to as the “white circle” in his analysis, has previously coincided with periods of strong upward momentum for XRP. According to EGRAG , XRP’s recent pullback to the $1.61 level in April 2025 marks its latest return to this critical area. The analyst argues that this development mirrors patterns seen during earlier market cycles, where a revisit to this zone preceded major price rallies. Based on this historical behavior, he has outlined three potential price targets for the next upward movement. Historical Analysis of XRP’s White Circle Pattern In EGRAG’s evaluation, the white circle represents a support region that XRP historically revisits after initial bullish breakouts above the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA). #XRP In The White Circle , We Always Pump! Based on my analysis, here are the potential targets: $11.50 $27 (with a massive 1227.5% pump) $42 Now, you might wonder: How did I arrive at these figures? Why is the minimum target $11.50, and why could we… pic.twitter.com/rnQebqMwED — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 20, 2025 This pattern was first observed in the 2017–2018 cycle. During that period, XRP surpassed the 21 EMA in March 2017 following nearly a year of sideways movement. From there, the asset rapidly climbed over 7,000% to reach $0.3988 by May 2017. Following this surge, XRP entered a consolidation phase that lasted approximately six months, ultimately returning to the 21 EMA. This marked the first instance of a white circle retest. The second leg of the rally then began, driving the token upward by an additional 1,900% to a peak of $3.55 in January 2018. A similar pattern emerged during the 2020–2021 market cycle. After years of trading below the 21 EMA due to broader market weakness and regulatory pressure, XRP broke above the moving average in late 2020, reaching $0.8294 by November. The rally was cut short, however, by the U.S. SEC lawsuit filed in December 2020. Nevertheless, XRP revisited the white circle support level and launched a secondary rally, rising nearly 500% to $1.98 by April 2021. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Context and Price Targets EGRAG believes XRP is currently repeating this pattern. The asset broke above the 21 EMA in November 2024 and reached a high of $3.40 by January 2025, representing a 580% gain. It has since entered a period of downward pressure, resulting in a retest of the 21 EMA in April at around $1.61. This price action, according to EGRAG, confirms another white circle revisit. Based on this technical behavior, he proposes three price targets. If XRP mimics the 2020–2021 pattern, a 465% gain from the 21 EMA could send the asset to $11.50. Should it follow the more aggressive 2017–2018 trajectory, it could rise by 1,964% to a peak of $42 . A middle-ground scenario, derived from the average of both previous cycles, yields a projected increase of 1,225%, placing XRP at $27, a level EGRAG has consistently emphasized in past analyses. While these projections are grounded in historical chart patterns and technical signals and are not mere speculation, investors must approach such forecasts with caution and consider market volatility and external factors when evaluating potential outcomes.

Why This Could Be the Best Entry Point of the Year,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/are-solana-sol-and-avalanche-avax-oversold-why-this-could-be-the-best-entry-point-of-the-year,"Recent market trends show significant price drops for both Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) . With values hitting lows, questions arise about whether this downturn signals a prime buying opportunity. Could these coins be on the verge of a significant rebound? Discover the factors that point to potential growth and why now might be the ideal time to invest. Solana Market Snapshot: Trends, Key Levels, and Trading Ideas Solana fell sharply over the past month, with prices dropping nearly 19% and a six-month decline of around 22%. The coin has struggled to maintain gains, reflecting a consistent downward movement over time. Price shifts have followed a pattern of quick corrections, and short-term dips have contributed to a broader bearish outlook. Declines over a single week of about 5% have added to the overall pressure, signaling that the market has been cautious in its movements. Volatility and a series of losses mark the recent performance, suggesting that sellers have been in control during these periods. The current price range sits between $136 and $182.20, with traders eyeing a key support level near $115.84 and the first resistance at $207.90. A second line of defense appears with support at $69.81, while a higher resistance is found around $253.93. The indicators show negative momentum, with both the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator below zero, confirming a bearish influence. The relative strength index at 38.07 indicates that the coin remains cautious, lacking a strong upward trend. Trading within these levels may involve seeking buying opportunities near support, along with careful stop-loss orders. Avalanche Trends: Bearish Past and Critical Price Levels Avalanche dropped 24% over the past month and slid 51.76% during the last six months. A week-long loss of 9.20% marks a clear downward movement in its price behavior. The coin has struggled to maintain recent levels, reflecting mounting bearish pressure and investor caution. The steady decline over these periods highlights the challenges the altcoin has faced, marked by a series of retracements that have left traders wary of further falls. The current price sits between $17.67 and $25.40, with strong support at $14.52 and resistance near $29.98. A secondary support at $6.79 and resistance at $37.70 add extra caution for market participants. A negative Awesome Oscillator of -2.90 and a Momentum reading of -3.95 suggest that bears dominate the market. An RSI of 34.66 indicates the coin could be nearing an oversold condition. Traders should watch for a potential bounce if the price touches the lower support and consider tight stop-loss strategies in this uncertain environment. Conclusion Both SOL and AVAX show signs of being oversold. This dip could provide a strong entry point for investors. The current prices may not last long. With potential for growth, entering now could yield high rewards. Timing is key in capturing future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

46506721,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=168845,1750548624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/46506721.jpeg,Can Solana and Bitcoin Match the Growth Outlook of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 100x Projections?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-solana-and-bitcoin-match-the-growth-outlook-of-magacoin-finances-100x-projections/,"While Bitcoin and Solana continue to hold commanding positions in the digital asset landscape, a rising force is drawing sharper focus from strategic investors and analysts alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With its early momentum accelerating and buyer interest increasing daily, the question now is whether legacy giants like BTC and SOL can keep pace with the explosive growth forecasted for this high-potential altcoin. Bitcoin trades firmly above $105,000, bolstered by inflows into its spot ETFs and increasing alignment with institutional portfolios. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem is evolving rapidly, preparing for a groundbreaking Alpenglow upgrade that could push transaction finality into sub-second territory. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding its narrative — not by replacing Bitcoin or Solana, but by carving out a distinct lane of ROI-focused opportunity that’s becoming difficult to ignore. Demand Is Shifting as Strategic Investors Seek Asymmetric Upside The high-cap status of Bitcoin and Solana means their growth potential is now largely tied to macro trends, ETF flows, and network upgrades. Bitcoin’s recent policy boost — with the U.S. government establishing a strategic crypto reserve funded by seized assets — signals strong top-down support. Likewise, Solana’s institutional traction is reflected in its $250M USDC minting and over $7.9M in daily network revenue. But that level of stability comes with a trade-off: reduced explosive upside. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in. With thousands already gaining early access, crypto insiders say it’s becoming one of the most actively watched projects of the year. Analysts tracking wallet behavior report surging participation in private access rounds, suggesting high conviction among early buyers. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outrun the Top Layer-1s Solana’s ecosystem continues to grow. Its upcoming Alpenglow upgrade — replacing Proof-of-History with Rotor and Votor layers — is expected to slash finality times from 12 seconds to 150 milliseconds. This positions SOL as a powerful platform for gaming, trading, and on-chain finance. In parallel, Ethereum-native developers are entering the Solana ecosystem through Solidity tooling enhancements, creating further developer momentum. Bitcoin, for its part, remains a macro asset favorite. The passage of the GENIUS Act and the executive order for a strategic crypto reserve — including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP — further elevates its institutional status. ETF inflows exceed $36 billion, outperforming even gold since launch. Still, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE may outperform every token this cycle due to its current positioning. With no venture capital dilution, a capped supply, and fully audited smart contracts, the foundation is being laid for what some traders describe as a “top-tier asymmetric opportunity.” High-Volume Buyers Signal What’s Coming As Solana processes tens of millions in staking activity and stablecoin volume, and Bitcoin garners support from firms like Metaplanet and Strategy, the volume metrics for MAGACOIN FINANCE tell a different story — one of breakout positioning. Crypto trackers have flagged recurring early buys and aggressive tiered entry in recent rounds, indicating confidence that extends beyond retail speculation. The structure of its entry model — including time-sensitive access mechanics — has created urgency among investors aiming to get positioned before major listings. Some early-stage analysts have pointed to similar early accumulation patterns observed in previous cycles, just before top-performing altcoins exploded. Whether that trajectory repeats remains to be seen, but MAGACOIN FINANCE has certainly established itself as a project with a sharp growth vector. Is This the Altcoin That Breaks Out in 2025? Bitcoin and Solana offer massive scale and global name recognition. Bitcoin is being labeled “digital gold” again, as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty steer investors toward hard assets. Solana, with its fast-growing DeFi ecosystem and $13 billion in stablecoin value, continues to attract developers, projects, and institutional transactions at an impressive rate. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is not aiming to compete with scale — it’s targeting velocity. Momentum. Early access ROI. With every forecast, every chart, and every tracked buyer position, the evidence points in one direction: up. Strategic buyers aren’t waiting for a green light — they’re already in. As analysts run models for the second half of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being placed in an elite category of potential altcoin outperformers. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and Solana remain pillars of strength in the ever-evolving crypto market. BTC’s alignment with macro policy and ETF success has solidified its reputation as a hedge asset, while Solana continues to set technical benchmarks with its high-speed performance and institutional utility. Yet, the landscape of opportunity is changing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a category-defining asset, not because it mimics the giants, but because it follows a different playbook. With strong early participation, analyst endorsements, and high-volume buy-ins accelerating, it’s no longer just an altcoin to watch — it’s one to act on. For investors seeking sharp upside, well-structured tokenomics, and early positioning before public listing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is commanding attention. The movement has started — and it’s unfolding in real time.

46506613,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72158,1750548640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SHIB Price Forecasts from $0.01 to $1: Here are Likely Timelines,https://timestabloid.com/shib-price-forecasts-from-0-01-to-1-here-are-likely-timelines/,"Shiba Inu continues to attract interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and market analysts, despite its current underperformance. Some remain optimistic about the token’s long-term prospects, envisioning potential price milestones as high as $0.01 or even $1. While these forecasts are ambitious, proponents cite past market behavior and future project developments as reasons to remain hopeful. Current Market Standing The token is currently trading at $0.00001105, showing a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours and an 8.17% decline in the last week. Over the last 30 days, the token has lost 27.98% of its value. According to CoinMarketCap , SHIB holds the 19th position among cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of approximately $6.7 billion. Despite recent losses, long-term supporters believe SHIB could still achieve substantial gains, referencing its explosive growth during the 2020–2021 bull run when it surged by over 150,000,000%. Among the SHIB community, the possibility of the token reaching $0.01 is often referred to as the “one-cent dream.” Achieving this would require an increase of over 87,000% from its current price. However, such a price would give SHIB a market valuation of nearly $5.89 trillion, an amount that far exceeds the current total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. Luis Delgado, a market observer, has expressed optimism about this possibility. He believes that upcoming initiatives from Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, could potentially drive significant upward momentum. Delgado has stated that SHIB was conceptually designed to reach around the $0.01 level and maintains that long-term market dynamics could support this goal. Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, known as Lucie, has also echoed this sentiment. While she acknowledged that achieving $0.01 would require time, she emphasized that it remains a realistic target given sufficient development and market support. Possibility of Reaching $1 A $1 price point for SHIB is considered even more improbable by most analysts, as it would require a surge of nearly 8.8 million percent. At this valuation, SHIB’s market cap would exceed $589 trillion, significantly surpassing the value of global financial assets and even the total money supply, which was estimated at $129 trillion in Q2 2024. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Still, the $1 forecast is occasionally discussed within the community. CoinW , a cryptocurrency exchange, included SHIB’s potential rise to $1 in a recent public poll alongside other bullish predictions for major cryptocurrencies. Lucie also referenced ChatGPT’s view that a $1 price, while extremely challenging, is not entirely impossible if several favorable conditions align, including widespread adoption, extensive token burns, and a strong bull market. However, many analysts disagree. TradeCityPro , a contributor on TradingView, considers the $1 goal unrealistic due to the market cap implications. Similarly, Bitcoin advocate Davinci Jeremie noted that SHIB will not reach such extreme valuations unless a large portion of its supply, currently at 589.25 trillion tokens, is removed from circulation. Forecast Timelines Neither Delgado nor Lucie has provided specific timelines for when SHIB might reach $0.01 or $1. To address this gap, predictions from platforms such as Changelly and Telegaon offer some guidance. According to Changelly, SHIB could reach the $0.01 mark by September 2040. Telegaon shares a similar estimate, projecting that SHIB may hit $0.08 by the end of 2040 and could even surpass $1 by 2050, reaching up to $1.06 under highly favorable circumstances. While there is a strong base of support for optimistic price targets, reaching $0.01 or $1 would require unprecedented market movements or a dramatic reduction in Shiba Inu’s circulating supply. As it stands, these milestones remain speculative and should be viewed with caution. The feasibility of such growth hinges on fundamental changes in tokenomics, adoption rates, and broader market dynamics.

Read This Report First,https://cryptopotato.com/think-crypto-is-used-for-illegal-activities-read-this-report-first/,"Cryptocurrency crime may be evolving, but the share of illicit such transactions remains strikingly small. According to TRM Labs’ latest annual report on crypto crime, just 0.4% of all digital asset transaction volume in 2024 was linked to unlawful activity, marking a 51% drop from the previous year despite a surge in the overall market. Illicit Crypto Activity Plummets Even as Total Volume Soars According to the blockchain intelligence firm, the total transaction volume in the crypto sector increased by 56% last year, surpassing $10.6 trillion. However, estimated illegal flows fell sharply to around $45 billion, down from nearly $59 billion in 2023. The report indicated that crypto crime was mainly dominated by sanction evaders, scammers, and funds linked to blocklisted addresses. Collectively, these categories represented over 85% of the illicit volume identified by TRM. Additionally, networks like Tron, Ethereum, and Bitcoin remained the top venues for such activity. Interestingly, while Tron alone accounted for 58% of all criminal flows, its illicit transaction volume actually fell by half compared to 2023. TRM attributed some of this success to the effectiveness of the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU), a pioneering public-private initiative targeting USDT misuse on Tron. Since its launch, it has helped freeze over $130 million , and nearly 20% of blocklisted USDT on Tron has already been returned to victims or authorities. Meanwhile, targeted sanctions against major Russian and Iranian exchanges such as Garantex and Nobitex, recently the target of a $49 million hack , have throttled inflows to restricted jurisdictions by 33%. Persistent Threats and the Evolving Criminal Playbook Despite the overall decline, TRM raised the alarm on emerging trends demanding vigilance. It stated that terrorism financing, particularly involving groups like ISIS-Khorasan (ISKP), is increasingly relying on crypto, with stablecoins remaining the primary choice despite a growing interest in privacy coins like Monero (XMR). Hacks also witnessed an uptick, with $2.2 billion stolen, representing a 17% increase, primarily targeting DeFi protocols. As has been reported by other researchers, North Korean actors were disproportionately responsible, stealing nearly $800 million using sophisticated methods, often focusing on private key theft. In addition, their laundering tactics have adapted, utilizing decentralized bridges and moving funds rapidly across chains to make recovery exceptionally difficult for law enforcement. But perhaps the most worrisome emerging threat is the rapid adoption of AI by fraudsters. According to TRM, criminals are now using large language models (LLMs) to craft highly personalized scam personas, generate convincing deepfake videos for extortion and investment scams, and produce sophisticated phishing messages. They are also using AI to create fake IDs to bypass KYC, and even generate non-consensual explicit imagery. The blockchain research firm is expecting a significant expansion of AI-powered crime in 2025. The post Think Crypto is Used for Illegal Activities?

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP’s price might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.67 Market Cap $2.49B Trading Volume $56.18M Circulating Supply 534.77M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.01 24-h Low $4.63 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.21% 14-Day RSI 41.68 50-Day SMA $5.36 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $6.51 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is trending downward, now down 5.30%. Short-term indicators solidify bearish momentum. The next key support is at $4.44. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP is facing strong selling pressure The 1-day chart for June 21 shows that ICP is under sustained bearish pressure, closing at $4.662 after a 5.30% drop. Price has broken below the key support at $5.011 and is now hovering above the next minor level around $4.594. ICP Momentum is clearly downward, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. The 20-day SMA at $5.353 is far above the current price, reinforcing the downward trend. MACD is firmly bearish with increasing red histogram bars and both MACD and signal lines declining, showing no sign of a reversal. If the $4.443 support breaks, ICP could accelerate its slide toward the $4.20–$4.00 zone. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP 4-hour chart confirms heavy selling pressure and weak recovery attempts The 4-hour chart reinforces the short-term bearish sentiment. ICP recently plunged below the lower Bollinger Band, showing strong selling momentum. Price is now trading at $4.667, below both the middle and upper Bollinger Bands, and also beneath the 20-period SMA at $4.980. ICP 4-hour chart confirms heavy selling pressure and weak recovery attempts The Balance of Power indicator sits deeply negative at -0.45, highlighting that sellers are firmly in control. There was a sharp wick down, indicating some buying interest, but it remains weak. Any recovery attempts may stall around the $4.76 and $4.98 levels unless bulls regain strength swiftly. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.93 SELL SMA 5 $5.18 SELL SMA 10 $5.44 SELL SMA 21 $5.45 SELL SMA 50 $5.36 SELL SMA 100 $5.37 SELL SMA 200 $6.51 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.33 SELL EMA 5 $5.28 SELL EMA 10 $5.20 SELL EMA 21 $5.29 SELL EMA 50 $5.83 SELL EMA 100 $6.83 SELL EMA 200 $7.89 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is showing clear bearish momentum across both the daily and 4-hour charts, with no immediate signs of reversal. Unless buyers step in decisively around the $4.44–$4.59 support zone, the token is likely to continue sliding or consolidating at lower levels. A short-term bounce is possible, but overall sentiment remains tilted to the downside. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Why is ICP down? ICP is down due to general market downturn, negative technical momentum failing to hold key supports (around $5.34–5.00), and waning DeFi activity even as developer engagement grows. ICP price chart | Coinmarketcap Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future. Price predictions indicate steady growth, with a potential increase year-on-year, reflecting a positive trend and strong market potential.

With reduced weekend liquidity expected, price action is likely to remain choppy, making it essential to closely monitor intraday volatility. A clearer setup could take time to develop, but this zone may offer early clues about the token’s next move. Oversold Pressure Builds: Is LINKBTC Ready To Rebound? In his expanded commentary, CRYPTOWZRD underscored that both the LINKUSDT and LINKBTC daily candles closed firmly bearish, mirroring Bitcoin’s broader pullback and highlighting the altcoin market’s continued sensitivity to BTC’s moves. He emphasized that this pattern underscores the need for healthier bullish candles to emerge before a sustainable recovery can take hold. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal Stands Firm, But Bitcoin Is Calling The Shots CRYPTOWZRD stated that LINKBTC sits in extremely oversold territory, suggesting that a positive reversal is statistically likely. Should a bounce materialize, he expects it to ignite a sharp upside spike in LINK, effectively flipping sentiment from bearish to bullish in short order. Turning to absolute price structure, CRYPTOWZRD noted that Chainlink is currently trading right at the $12.50 daily support target, a zone he considers pivotal. A decisive bullish reversal from this level, he argues, is essential to trigger an impulsive upside move and reestablish upward momentum. If buyers can reclaim control, CRYPTOWZRD identifies $16 as the next critical resistance, followed by a more substantial barrier at $19.50. Clearing these levels would signal that the tide has truly shifted, paving the way for a broader trend change rather than a short‑lived bounce. Despite this bullish roadmap, CRYPTOWZRD cautioned that Bitcoin’s weekend price action will remain a major influence on Chainlink, especially given the expected drop in liquidity. As a result, he plans to focus on lower‑time‑frame charts in the coming sessions, seeking quick scalp opportunities while waiting for clearer confirmation of direction. Chainlink Intraday Setup Builds Around $12.85 Decision Point Assessing the immediate outlook, the analyst notes that LINK’s intraday chart remains bearish and noticeably volatile, underscoring the market’s current uncertainty. Price action has been chopping around key levels, making any clear direction difficult to trust without firm confirmation. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong At $15.29 Support – Is A New Breakout Imminent? On the bullish side, the analyst points out that a decisive breakout and sustained hold above the $12.85 intraday resistance could flip sentiment. If buyers manage to establish support above this line, the setup would present a compelling long opportunity with an initial upside target near $14.40, where the next significant resistance resides. Conversely, the analyst warns that a failed attempt to hold $12.85—marked by a retest and subsequent decline- would favor the bears. Such rejection would create potential short setups, as renewed selling pressure could drag the price lower, especially if broader market conditions stay cautious.

These projects combine accessibility with strong fundamentals and innovation, making them prime candidates for high returns. From DeFi protocols to AI-powered blockchains and political meme tokens, a small group of undervalued presales are already showing signs of explosive growth potential. Here are five standout tokens crypto insiders are watching and buying before listings go live. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Analyst Support as a 2025 Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a leading force in the current crypto presale cycle. Fueled by a combination of political branding, locked tokenomics, and early-stage investor momentum, the project is setting up for what analysts describe as a potentially explosive launch. The project is built on scarcity, transparency, and long-term tokenomics. The 170 billion token supply is permanently locked. No venture capital control. Fully audited by HashEx. And 100% designed for early investors looking for asymmetric upside. Analysts tracking early-stage altcoins say MAGACOIN FINANCE is already outperforming across watchlists and leaderboards. Additionally, top analysts are forecasting major upside, with projections ranging up to 100x under favorable market conditions. Mutuum Finance: A DeFi Powerhouse in the Making Mutuum Finance has caught investor attention with its innovative dual-lending model and consistent upward trajectory. Its presale phases sold out at a rapid pace, with investor demand pushing each round higher. Analysts are closely watching the token as it heads toward a confirmed listing price that could double early positions instantly. At the heart of Mutuum’s value proposition is a hybrid Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending engine, designed for capital efficiency and long-term staking benefits. The platform continuously buys back its own token and redistributes it to stakers, creating a cycle of organic demand. Security is a top priority, with Mutuum undergoing a smart contract audit by CertiK. The platform has also rolled out high-value rewards for top participants, encouraging early and long-term investor commitment. Market analysts say Mutuum Finance may be this year’s breakout DeFi project — especially as momentum accelerates and its on-chain fundamentals outperform newer platforms. Qubetics ($TICS): The Infrastructure-First Blockchain Qubetics is positioning itself at the intersection of infrastructure and interoperability. With token scarcity hardcoded and real-world use cases spanning asset tokenization, decentralized VPNs, and seamless cross-chain value transfer, Qubetics offers more than hype — it offers purpose. The project’s low-code builder, QubeQode, and built-in multi-chain IDE make it easy for developers to deploy on-chain applications, giving it a strategic edge. Demand is surging as investors seek infrastructure plays with lasting utility. Previous presale stages sold out instantly, and the final stage is nearing completion. The listing price will activate shortly, triggering a sharp valuation step-up. Crypto analysts expect Qubetics to perform well post-launch, with token scarcity, real-world functionality, and Layer-1 positioning as key catalysts. Lightchain AI (LCAI): Where Blockchain Meets Intelligence Lightchain AI is making its final presale push ahead of a July 2025 mainnet launch. With a deflationary supply model and a Proof-of-Intelligence consensus layer, the platform rewards validators for completing real AI tasks such as model inference and neural computation. LCAI is not built on hype — it’s built for scale. The upcoming Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) will support AI-focused dApps using major frameworks like PyTorch.

These aren’t coins riding on hype alone. They are backed by measurable growth, expanding communities, and clear plans. Whether through strong fundamentals or aggressive ecosystem growth, these projects are actively building their place in the market. BlockDAG currently leads this group by transforming early momentum into wide-reaching adoption. 1. BlockDAG: Real Growth Backed by Strategy & Scale BlockDAG sits at the top of the list of top-performing cryptos today, thanks to its ability to drive results on multiple fronts. The presale has raised $315 million, with the current batch priced at $0.0020 and set to increase to $0.0030 on June 24. Since batch 1, the project has recorded a 2,660% ROI, with over 23 billion coins sold so far. Much of this traction comes from the X1 Miner App, which has brought in more than 2 million users through a tap-to-mine system that’s simple and mobile-first. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is preparing for wider exposure, with confirmed sponsorships in the U.S. to help reach a more mainstream audience. The scale of its $600 million presale is allowing BlockDAG to fund its tech development, global outreach, and user adoption simultaneously. That layered approach makes it a leading name in practical adoption this year. 2. Filecoin: Storage Demand Fuels Renewed Growth Filecoin secures its position among the top-performing cryptos today as decentralized storage gains fresh relevance. The platform is already well-known for hosting data on-chain, and recent growth is linked to rising demand from AI-driven and enterprise-level data sets. With the need for reliable, distributed storage rising, Filecoin’s real-world application continues to drive adoption. This time, the price gains are not speculative, they are being supported by practical use, growing developer interest, and emerging institutional curiosity. 3. Arbitrum: Layer 2 Scaling Gains Real Momentum Arbitrum continues to be one of the top-performing cryptos today, largely due to its Layer 2 rollup tech that enhances Ethereum scalability while preserving security. As the industry shifts toward efficient scaling, Arbitrum has already processed billions in transactions and remains a popular choice for developers. Its recent price increase is supported by new DeFi activity and ecosystem partnerships that are boosting demand. As more users and platforms seek faster and more cost-effective environments, Arbitrum is capturing attention and resources. 4. Cronos: Ecosystem Expansion Supports Steady Climb Cronos is making its way back into the spotlight as one of the top-performing cryptos today, driven by steady advances in gaming, DeFi, and NFT sectors. With support from Crypto.com, Cronos has seen more user activity, developer engagement, and rising transaction volumes. Recent upgrades and new funding programs have added to its appeal, helping to push its price upward. With liquidity incentives and a stronger infrastructure in place, Cronos is rebuilding momentum through consistent, utility-focused development. While it may not grab the loudest headlines, its integration and sustained progress make it worth watching. What Sets the Top Performers Apart Among the top-performing cryptos today , projects like BlockDAG are standing out by combining multiple strengths, capital, reach, and usability. Arbitrum is excelling through efficient scaling, Filecoin through its expanding role in data storage, and Cronos through its multi-sector ecosystem growth. But BlockDAG’s combination of user growth, strategic partnerships, and strong funding positions it on a broader path. It’s not only scaling, it’s executing across infrastructure, outreach, and adoption at once. That kind of full-spectrum performance is what separates long-term builders from short-term plays as 2025 unfolds.

The firm notes in a recent post on the social media platform X that “the utility and growth of the network continues looking healthier than ever.” “The amount of new weekly ETH addresses created is ranging around 800,000-1 million per week, compared to about one-third less at this point last year.” Source: Santiment/X ETH is trading at $2,421 at time of writing. The second-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 3.5% in the past day. Despite Ethereum’s growing network, Santiment notes that a different layer-1 project, Tron ( TRX ), has been dominating the social media conversation. “The Tron blockchain and ecosystem is trending, including its deflationary tokenomics, staking options via Tronscan and TronLink, and its role in stablecoin transactions, especially USDT on Tron. Discussions include token conversions, swapping, and competition with Ethereum in DeFi (decentralized finance) and stablecoin transfers. Tron is also noted for a potential NASDAQ listing and involvement of notable figures, enhancing its prominence. TRX, the native token, is highlighted for fast, low-cost transactions, a growing DeFi, NFT (non-fungible tokens), and dApp ecosystem, surpassing Dogecoin in market cap, and a $210 million reverse merger attracting institutional interest.” TRX is trading at $0.273 at time of writing.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote : “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The impact on crypto was instant. Traders dumped risk as the US joined Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign against Iran. The market panic came after days of speculation that Washington would side with Tel Aviv following Israel’s unilateral strike on Iranian territory — once again citing half a century of unproven nuclear weapons claims. The new US airstrikes have now confirmed its involvement. XRP drops, Ether struggles, Solana hit hardest As Bitcoin slid under the $100,000 line, XRP dropped to $1.8, a 3.1% hit. Ether fell to $2,201, while Solana tumbled harder than the others, now sitting at $121, down over 5%. These moves erased all gains from earlier in the week. Meanwhile shortly after Trump’s post, Israel said it had killed Saeed Izadi, a senior commander in Iran’s Quds Force, during an airstrike on an apartment in Qom. Defense Minister Israel Katz called Izadi’s killing “a major achievement,” claiming he had supplied weapons and money to Hamas before its October 7 attack that launched the war in Gaza. Izadi had been on both US and British sanctions lists. While Israeli forces targeted Izadi in Qom, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed that five of its members died in separate strikes on Khorramabad, though Izadi was not named in their statement. Iranian outlets reported that a 16-year-old was killed and two others wounded in the Qom strike. Iranian state news agency Nour News said that 430 people have been killed and 3,500 injured inside Iran since Israel began bombing on June 13. In retaliation, Iranian missile strikes have killed 24 civilians in Israel, according to Israeli officials. The air war is now dragging both sides into their worst conflict in decades. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said there will be no negotiations with Washington as long as the attacks continue. Speaking in Istanbul during a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Araqchi said, “It is obvious that I can’t go to negotiations with the US when our people are under bombardments under the support of the US.” A day earlier, Araqchi had met with European foreign ministers in Geneva in a last-ditch diplomatic attempt. That effort appears dead now. Trump, speaking Friday, said he would decide “within two weeks” whether to send more US forces to the conflict, depending on whether “people come to their senses.” He also claimed Iran could build a nuclear weapon in weeks, saying, “We can’t let that happen.” Meanwhile, Iran’s Fars News Agency reported that Israel struck the Isfahan nuclear facility, one of the country’s most important atomic sites. It said there were no radioactive leaks, but damage assessments are still underway. Israel also said it launched a wave of attacks on missile storage and launch infrastructure, hitting multiple locations across Iran in a wider campaign.

Hidden among the ocean of digital currencies, three lesser-known tokens are catching their eye. These under-the-radar picks could be primed for rapid growth. Explore which coins are on their radar and why they might be the next big thing in the crypto market. Jito Price Snapshot: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Decline Last month, Jito showed steady gains with a +3.50% price increase, while the past week added another +2.14% to the mix. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a significant decline of about -27.77%, marking a long-term downtrend despite recent short-term improvements. Price fluctuations were evident as the range moved between $1.35 and $2.11, reflecting both quick recoveries and persistent weakness over time. At the current stage, the price sits between a tested support at $1.06 and an immediate resistance level at $2.56, with a broader range that extends to a second resistance at $3.32 and a second support at $0.30. The RSI at 52.96 indicates balanced sentiment, while the momentum indicator at -0.029 adds a slight bearish note. Traders might consider buying near $1.06 and look for a possible bounce, while a drop below this level could trigger a deeper sell-off. A breakthrough above $2.56 could open the door toward $3.32. The coin is currently in a consolidation phase that requires careful observation around these key levels. AB Coin Surge: Massive Gains Amid Key Price Milestones AB performance over the past month shows a remarkable leap with an 83.01% gain, while the half-year statistics reveal an astounding 8974.27% increase. The week-to-week rise of 5.65% adds to a vivid picture of strong upward momentum. Price action has spread from a range of $0.0043 to $0.0116, setting the stage for dynamic market responses. The numbers point to accelerated growth and strong investor sentiment, reflected in substantial price progress over both monthly and half-year time frames. The current market setup revolves around key price markers that guide trading decisions. Trading is occurring between a support level at $0.0004 and nearest resistance at $0.015, with a secondary resistance around $0.0223. Technical indicators show moderate balance with an RSI of 57.16 and a Momentum Indicator of 0.001. Bulls are in play, but caution is advised near resistance. Traders could consider entering long positions if the price holds near resistance or utilize tight stops if it slips toward support, making strategic moves in this bullish phase. Mantle Price Behavior and Key Levels Overview Data from the past month shows a decline of approximately 15% while the half-year performance has decreased by close to 46%. These price drops indicate a consistent downturn characterized by weakening sentiment and reduced buying interest. This erosion of value marks recent times as particularly challenging for the coin, reflecting broader market sentiments and investor reluctance. Currently, Mantle trades in a range between $0.61 and $0.79. Immediate resistance is observed at $0.90, with support near $0.54. Additional levels include $1.08 to the upside and $0.36 on the downside. Indicators such as a relative strength index near 41.84, along with negative momentum, suggest moderate bearish control. The absence of a clear trend presents opportunities for cautious trading, with an emphasis on monitoring the support boundary for potential reversals. A breach of resistance may signal upward movement, highlighting the importance of clearer directional cues before making any commitments. Conclusion JTO , AB , and MNT have shown potential for growth in June. These coins have caught the attention of top investors. Their new features and promising use cases set them apart from others. Monitoring these coins could be beneficial for those looking for future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

33767162,[object Object],1750552208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Analyst Who Puts Dogecoin Price At $10 Reveals The Trend That Will Drive The Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-reach-10/,"A crypto analyst has shared a new bullish forecast for the Dogecoin price , predicting that the world’s largest meme coin could soar to a double-digit valuation of $10. Although Dogecoin still trades significantly below $1, the analyst remains confident in this bold target. He points to a unique trend tied to Bitcoin’s market behavior , which he believes could be the key catalyst behind this projected bullish rally. Dogecoin Price To Reach $10 As Bitcoin Hits ATH A widely followed crypto analyst, known as Dima James Potts, has projected a long-term bullish surge for Dogecoin, believing that a price rally to $10 and beyond was inevitable. This prediction is based on a recurring logarithmic arc pattern that has accurately tracked Dogecoin’s multi-year market cycles. According to Potts’s weekly Dogecoin price chart , the meme coin has repeatedly followed a clear sequence: starting with an extended consolidation along a lower curve support, followed by a sharp breakout toward an upper curved resistance. This unique pattern has held through multiple cycles since 2014, with each new rally beginning just after Dogecoin breaks above a descending trendline , typically marked with a dramatic spike in volume and price. In this cycle, Potts notes that the recurring historical structure has taken a long time to develop due to an early peak in the 2021 bull market , which has led to Dogecoin’s prolonged accumulation phase. However, the chart shows DOGE still respecting the lower curve, suggesting that the roadmap and build-up for a massive upward move may be underway . Notably, the critical point of this bullish forecast will arrive when the Bitcoin price secures a weekly close above its previous all-time high above $109,450 . Currently, its price is still sitting below past highs around $103,528 after falling below the $100,000 mark due to broader market volatility and political uncertainty. Based on Potts’ analysis, Dogecoin’s performance and potential to hit $10 are contingent on Bitcoin reaching a ne w all-time high. Once this occurs, Potts believes that DOGE will begin a parabolic rally, with the potential to form a cycle peak around the final week of October. Key Elements And Timelines Strengthen Bullish Case Beyond the price targets, Potts’ chart analysis highlights critical structural elements supporting Dogecoin’s optimistic outlook . A series of descending yellow trendlines on Potts’ chart have historically acted as resistance in previous cycles—with each major breakout occurring shortly after the meme coin’s price had closed above these lines. Also marked are purple vertical lines that show the timeline of Dogecoin’s cycles. Each peak in previous years followed soon after these markers, with the next one set for October 27, 2025. Another notable factor is the accumulation length. Past rallies emerged after more than 1,400 days of sideways price action . The current cycle has already surpassed that duration, with over 1,600 days of gradual buildup and moderate trading volume . These recurring market behaviours seen in past cycles add weight to the projection that Dogecoin may be preparing for its most significant rally yet.",Dogecoin|Descending Trendline|Dima Potts|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-22 00:30:08

But what truly marks Solana’s Q3 as an accumulation zone is the looming ETF approval. VanEck’s spot Solana ETF (VSOL) is now listed on the DTCC website, and approval could come as early as July. Coupled with Solana’s expanding DePIN ecosystem (Helium, Hivemapper, Render), over 11.6 million active wallets, and $8 billion+ in TVL, this is an ecosystem ready to launch. Yet, as attention floods into SOL, early MAGACOIN FINANCE adopters see an opportunity to enter a high-potential project before it reaches such institutional visibility. Cardano: Staking, DeFi, and a Political Tailwind ADA now trading around $0.61–$0.63, ADA is retesting key support, with some analysts warning of a possible drop to $0.50. But others point to a possible rally toward $10 based on DeFi expansion and institutional interest. Staking addresses have surpassed 1.3 million, and the introduction of Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano through Lace Wallet represents a game-changing cross-chain bridge. However, despite these technical and developmental merits, the upside for ADA may be limited by its sheer market maturity. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the start of its journey an altcoin with fresh legs and a growing community. Sei: Quiet Strength and DeSci Disruption SEI’s performance has been quietly impressive. Up 23% in a week and trading at $0.27, SEI is gaining traction through tokenization projects with the Bank of England, a $65 million DeSci grant fund, and rumors of a potential acquisition of 23andMe to revolutionize data privacy. Sei’s ecosystem is thriving with fast decentralized trading via Seiyan DEX, NFT activity on Pallet, and rising ESG credentials. While these fundamentals could push SEI to $0.77 by year-end, it still faces volatility and adoption hurdles. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by comparison, is eliminating uncertainty early laying down a solid infrastructure, community-first incentives, and audit-backed assurances. Final Word There’s no denying that Solana, Cardano, and Sei are accumulating strength but they’re also known quantities with major capital already priced in. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is in the sweet spot: undervalued, early-stage, and surging with presale momentum. With crypto insiders already in and analysts forecasting life-changing ROI potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just forming an accumulation zone it is the accumulation zone to watch this quarter.

Among the leaders in 2025 are Ethereum, Cardano, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, each fueling different layers of crypto growth. While ETH and ADA benefit from historical strength and ecosystem upgrades, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most strategically watched tokens in the entire market. Ethereum Holds the Line with Institutional Backing Ethereum has bounced back strongly after underperformance earlier this year, gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours alone. Trading volume exceeded 819,000 ETH as bulls reclaimed control, pushing prices toward the $2,600 resistance zone. What makes ETH stand out now is the growing institutional interest in staking. The Lido Foundation reports an increase in institutional onboarding, potentially boosting long-term network stability and reinforcing Ethereum’s credibility among major players. Investor sentiment remains strong in the U.S. as well, with Coinbase Premium data signaling rising demand from American buyers. If this trend continues, Ethereum could lead the Layer-1 pack into a new leg of the market cycle. Still, analysts advise caution. While bullish momentum is building, early signs of profit-taking and a declining taker buy-sell ratio suggest traders should watch resistance levels closely. Any breakout above $2,560 would open the door to targets at $2,580, $2,610, and $2,650. Cardano: Development Surges While Eyes Stay on the Charts Cardano has delivered strong year-to-date gains, up 55% over the past 12 months. Despite a recent 10% correction, ADA remains active in technical development, with bullish metrics like exchange withdrawals surpassing $900 million since January—a clear signal of whale accumulation. Recent milestones include the UTXO-HD upgrade for scalable storage and wallet integration with Brave, Trust Wallet, and Emurgo. These moves are expanding Cardano’s DeFi capabilities and long-term network strength. Still, Cardano remains a staple in smart contract ecosystems. With TPS scaling simulations and a potential privacy partnership with Litecoin on the horizon, ADA’s relevance is expected to remain strong heading into the second half of the year. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining Traction With High-Conviction Buyers MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025. While many projects battle for visibility, this one is gaining popularity. It has already attracted significant whale attention, including six-figure ETH purchases during its early phases, a clear indicator that crypto insiders are positioning now. Momentum continues to build daily as high-volume buyer activity increases. Analysts tracking early-stage altcoins say MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the next meme-fueled cycle, but with something more powerful: real tokenomics and utility-driven rewards now officially activated. With a fixed token supply and strong fundamentals, investors are moving early to secure positions before major listings begin. The market isn’t guessing—strategic buyers are already in. Conclusion The quiet rotation of smart money is no longer speculation—it’s happening in real time. Ethereum is regaining its leadership status through institutional staking. Cardano is executing steady development despite volatility. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising with speed and certainty. Momentum is building fast, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is establishing itself as the altcoin to watch. Analysts say this will outperform every token this cycle.

Amid announcement of new US trade tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, the premier cryptocurrency has come under bearish influences to trade as low as 101,000. At press time, Bitcoin is hovering near $104,000 following a 2.03% % decline in the past day. However, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted a crucial price range worth monitoring especially in the advent of a further price decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential $95,500–$97,000: Bitcoin’s Line In The Sand In a recent X post, Glassnode shares an insight into the Bitcoin market based on data from Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) heatmap. The CBD is a common on-chain metric that tracks the price levels at which tokens were last purchased or sold. When a substantial amount of coins are traded within a specific price range, it forms a supply cluster capable of acting as a support or resistance level. According to Glassnode’s report, the Bitcoin’s CBD heatmap shows the first dense supply cluster below the current market price lies at $95,500 – $97,000 price zone. Interestingly, this range rests just below the short-term holders (STH) cost basis suggesting a confluence of technical and on-chain metric to present a high-stake battleground. Therefore, Glassnode analysts explain that holding the market price above this threshold reinforces bullish momentum and boosts Bitcoin chances of re-entering a price discovery mode. However, a breakdown below the $95,500 price level could trigger panic selling supporting bearish projections for the mid-term to short-term. Interestingly, prominent market analysts including anonymous X expert with username Mr. Wall Street has backed the latter scenario stating Bitcoin is due for a further price drops. Mr. Wall Street strictly warns Bitcoin would not hold above the $100,000 psychological support zone forecasting a price fall to around the $93,000 – $95,000 which Glassnode predicts should induce widescale market liquidations.

Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,753 with a cumulative 1.27% decline in the past week. During this period, the flagship cryptocurrency remained largely under $106,000 barring a weak price breakout between June 16 and June 17. On a monthly scale, Bitcoin has now recorded a 6.10% loss, signaling a gradual shift in momentum with bearish forces regaining control of the market. Meanwhile, with a market cap of $2.05 trillion, the “digital gold” continues to rank as the largest cryptocurrency with a reported market dominance of 64.3%.

This legislative development introduces a federal framework for regulating stablecoins and is poised to support companies like Ripple as they expand their payment services within the United States. Passed with bipartisan support, the GENIUS Act establishes comprehensive guidelines for the issuance and management of stablecoins backed by the U.S. dollar. Its core objective is to promote financial innovation by delivering regulatory certainty to firms operating in the digital currency space. The legislation also aims to enhance the efficiency of domestic and international payment networks while maintaining the U.S. dollar’s leading role in global finance. Ripple’s Strategic Position in the Stablecoin Ecosystem Ripple entered the stablecoin market in 2024 with the introduction of RLUSD , its U.S. dollar–pegged digital asset. In a relatively short time, RLUSD has reached a market capitalization of $415 million, establishing Ripple as a notable participant in the compliant digital finance sector. The firm’s expansion efforts have been supported at the state level, with regulatory approvals secured in jurisdictions such as New York and Texas. In addition, Ripple holds more than 50 money transmitter licenses across various U.S. states. These licenses authorize the company to offer cross-border payment services to financial institutions, leveraging both XRP and RLUSD. Implications of the GENIUS Act for Ripple and the Broader Market The GENIUS Act complements Ripple’s ongoing regulatory compliance efforts by providing a unified national structure for stablecoin regulation. XRP community researcher “SMQKE” recently emphasized on social media that Ripple’s RLUSD is already aligned with the Act’s regulatory expectations. RIPPLE IS LEGALLY ALLOWED TO OFFER CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT SERVICES TO U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS USING RLUSD AND XRP Documented. https://t.co/bxNKD2B4GP pic.twitter.com/0XZPqK8gIH — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 19, 2025 RLUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and short-term government securities, with independent monthly attestations verifying its reserves. According to SMQKE, as RLUSD sees increased institutional adoption, the associated use of XRP will also grow. Since transaction fees on the XRP Ledger are paid in XRP and then permanently removed from circulation, this could gradually reduce the overall supply of the token, potentially influencing its value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The GENIUS Act also helps position RLUSD and XRP as viable alternatives to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), particularly within a defined and enforceable legal structure. This clarity may improve institutional confidence and accelerate adoption across financial markets. Forward Momentum and Market Speculation The bill is now under consideration in the House of Representatives. President Donald Trump has publicly urged lawmakers to approve the legislation without delay, citing its importance in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in financial technology. Some XRP proponents, such as Chad Steingraber , have expressed optimism about the long-term price outlook for the asset. They argue that regulatory milestones like the GENIUS Act could support ambitious growth targets, including projections of XRP reaching $250. While future outcomes remain speculative, the alignment of federal and state policies with Ripple’s business model may prove to be a critical enabler of its cross-border payment ambitions using both XRP and RLUSD.

JPMD will cater to institutions that want the legal protections , interest payments, and bank integration that regular stablecoins don’t fully offer to move money quickly, safely, and around the clock. JPMD combines traditional banking features with blockchain speed and access on a public blockchain (Base, built on Ethereum) to attract big institutions who fear stablecoins like USDC or USDT will raise concerns about regulation, stability, and trust. But will deposit tokens like JPMD completely replace stablecoins for institutional use, or will they simply serve different purposes and grow side by side? How are deposit tokens different from stablecoins? Deposit tokens fit into commercial banks’ existing financial and legal framework because they come with added benefits, like deposit insurance, interest payments, and accounting clarity for managing large volumes of funds. On the other hand, stablecoins don’t enjoy the same trust or integration with banks because the US Congress is still debating the rules around using and backing them. In addition, the openness and availability of stablecoins for trading, remittances, lending, DeFi protocols, and as a fast way to store and move value across borders have helped them grow into a $260 billion market. Constrastly, deposit coins set large transactions, enable tokenized securities, handle business-to-business payments, and manage digital cash in a way that ties back to a real-world bank account to serve the complex needs of institutions. So, while stablecoins operate outside the bounds of traditional finance and serve a wide global audience, deposit tokens help the banks move money faster and more efficiently within the trusted, regulated walls of the banking system. Why does JPMorgan believe JPMD is better for institutions? JPMD combines the convenience of blockchain with the confidence and structure of commercial banking for institutional users who need digital money that moves fast but also complies with strict legal, financial, and operational standards. JPMorgan hosts JPMD on the Base blockchain (a public Layer 2 network built by Coinbase on top of Ethereum) to protect it from misuse or unwanted exposure and allow only verified institutional clients to interact with the system. This way, the bank creates access to faster settlements and lower fees while controlling who uses the token through permissioned access. The Base blockchain bridges JPMD to future blockchain use cases with its connection to Ethereum’s broader ecosystem. Businesses can also use JPMD in treasury operations, accounting systems, and financial reports without the extra friction that comes with third-party stablecoins. This is because the token allows them to treat it like cash they already hold in their JPMorgan accounts. Accountants, CFOs, and risk officers can easily trust, track, and report JPMD tokens because they are tied directly into the bank’s own infrastructure. This differs from stablecoins that sit outside the banking system and may raise questions about compliance or reserve backing. JPMorgan also said JPMD will likely pay interest while still providing instant settlement and on-chain liquidity. This will make it more appealing as a long-term financial tool for institutions with large cash balances and wanting their funds to generate yield. The token may also become insured like bank deposits to reduce risk and offer a level of protection that stablecoins currently can’t match in high-value transactions. Moreover, JPMD makes it easier for institutions to incorporate blockchain-based transactions without overhauling their internal workflows or facing delays due to incompatible systems. The token integrates seamlessly with enterprise treasury platforms, payment processing tools, and settlement engines. It also supports financial reporting systems to manage cash flow, settle trades, facilitate cross-border payments, and ensure regulatory compliance. Businesses can also settle payments across jurisdictions instantly with JPMD to reduce delays, high costs, and limited operating hours in cross-border business-to-business (B2B) payments and tokenized asset settlements. What could stop deposit tokens from taking over? Deposit tokens have less potential as a universal digital cash solution because JPMD is only available to pre-approved institutional clients connected to the bank. While anyone with a crypto wallet can access and use stablecoins, the permissioned nature of deposit tokens prevents smaller businesses, startups, or individuals from accessing the token, despite it running on a public blockchain. Banks using or issuing these tokens may face strict capital requirements and other compliance burdens. This is because current Basel guidelines classify digital tokens operating on public, permissionless blockchains as high-risk assets. These institutions may be constrained by rules that make large-scale deployment expensive, risky, or not worth the effort, unless the Basel Committee updates its guidance or makes exceptions for well-structured deposit tokens. Moreover, JPMD may end up being siloed within a limited ecosystem because many institutions and platforms may prefer Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Avalanche, or private blockchains for their digital asset strategies over its Layer 2 network built on Ethereum (Base). In contrast, Stablecoins like USDC and USDT are highly attractive to developers, fintech companies, crypto exchanges, and users in emerging markets who want to move value across platforms without worrying about permissioned access or network compatibility. These stablecoins operate on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. They have a wide global reach, widespread wallet support, and integration with decentralized applications. Similarly, smaller firms, fintechs, and international businesses may not have the technical infrastructure, legal clarity, or compliance capabilities that large institutions require to work with a permissioned token tied to a US bank. Firms operating in multiple regions or jurisdictions may not want to maintain a relationship with a specific bank to undergo a complex onboarding process. It may be difficult for deposit tokens to reach the scale and utility that stablecoins have already achieved when their growth is limited to a small circle of elite users. JPMD and similar tokens remain too tightly linked to individual banking ecosystems. Stablecoins and deposit tokens will likely grow side by side The infrastructure around digital tokens and stablecoins will decide which models succeed and at what scale as banks, governments, and global companies continue to experiment with tokenized assets, digital payments, and programmable money. Both stablecoins and deposit tokens could grow together, serving different types of users and use cases if public blockchains become widely accepted as safe, reliable environments for moving real-world value. It’s unlikely that either stablecoins or deposit tokens will completely replace the other, so the more realistic outcome is coexistence. Deposit tokens will likely dominate in highly regulated, high-value environments where trust, control, and integration with existing systems are essential. On the other hand, stablecoins will continue to lead in areas where openness, speed, and accessibility matter most, such as retail payments, global remittances, and decentralized applications.
