According to analyst Xaif, social data from Santiment reveals that XRP‚Äôs bullish-to-bearish comment ratio has climbed to 2.1 to 1, its highest level in over two weeks. This renewed optimism starkly contrasts with the declining sentiment around Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), both of which are showing signs of fatigue across social platforms. Ripple-SEC Case Nears Conclusion The shift in sentiment comes just days after a critical development in the Ripple-SEC legal saga. On June 26, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres formally rejected the refiled joint motion submitted by Ripple and the SEC. The proposed motion had sought to modify the court‚Äôs earlier judgment by reducing Ripple‚Äôs penalty from $125 million to $50 million and lifting the standing injunction against its institutional XRP sales. BREAKING: XRP Sees Abnormally Bullish Sentiment Despite Ripple v. SEC Setback! highest in 2+ weeks, outshining BTC & ETH #XRP #Ripple #Crypto pic.twitter.com/XtLycKbIp4 ‚Äî ùïèaif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 27, 2025 Her decision reinforced the validity of the court‚Äôs July 2023 final judgment, which still holds Ripple liable for a $125 million penalty and enforces a permanent injunction on certain XRP transactions. Appeals Withdrawn, Case Winds Down Despite the setback, Ripple has opted to bring the legal battle to an end. On June 27, CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company would withdraw its counter-appeal . The SEC is also expected to drop its appeal. With both sides moving away from further litigation, the case is finally winding down after more than three years of court proceedings. The withdrawal of appeals signals that neither party intends to continue disputing the terms of the standing final judgment. For XRP holders, this conclusion brings long-awaited clarity. Although the court declined to reduce Ripple‚Äôs penalty or lift the injunction, the fact that the matter is now essentially closed eliminates the legal overhang that has clouded XRP‚Äôs future since late 2020. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Sentiment Soars as Legal Uncertainty Fades What might appear as a procedural defeat has instead fueled optimism across the XRP community. Many investors view the resolution as a net positive, particularly since the most important aspect of the July 2023 ruling remains intact: Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not a security, and that Ripple‚Äôs programmatic sales did not violate securities laws. While Ripple was found liable for its institutional sales, the decision marked a major legal victory for the broader crypto industry and a defining moment for XRP‚Äôs regulatory status. As the legal dust settles, XRP‚Äôs sentiment spike reflects more than just relief; it‚Äôs a sign of confidence in the token‚Äôs long-term viability. With legal risks behind it, XRP is now poised to reenter the spotlight based on its use case, technology, and adoption potential, rather than its courtroom drama. A Turning Point for XRP XRP‚Äôs rising sentiment underscores a broader narrative shift. XRP is emerging from its defining legal battle with one of the clearest legal profiles in the digital asset space. Xaif‚Äôs sentiment analysis captures a community that is no longer weighed down by litigation but is instead looking forward, with renewed conviction. For traders and investors alike, this may mark the beginning of a new phase for XRP‚Äîone focused on growth, clarity, and market momentum.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum of $16.26 and a minimum of $13.05. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $30.04 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot‚Äôs position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let‚Äôs get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.35 (+1.36%) Market Cap $6.32B Trading Volume $156.75M Circulating Supply 1.58B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $4.12 24-hour Low $3.98 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 7.77% 50-Day SMA $4.42 14-Day RSI 48.45 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $4.54 Polkadot price analysis: DOT price rebounds to $3.35 with key support holding firm Tight range shows market caution. DOT is trading between $3.30 and $3.39, signaling consolidation and low volatility. $3.39 resistance remains firm, and repeated failures to break above $3.39 show a strong seller presence at that level. Higher lows suggest bullish pressure, gradual higher lows point to steady buying interest, and potential for an upward breakout. Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading at $3.35, showing a modest daily gain of 1.36% as of June 28th, 2025. This latest price movement positions DOT near the upper end of its daily range, with resistance identified at $3.39 and support sitting at $3.30. The asset‚Äôs performance reflects renewed buying interest as bulls attempt to regain control within a tight consolidation range. DOT‚Äôs price has stabilized after a period of muted volatility, following broader market indecision. The cryptocurrency remains well below its all-time high of $55.00 reached on November 4, 2021, marking a steep drawdown of 93.89%. However, the asset has managed to maintain a significant buffer above its all-time low of $2.69 recorded on August 20, 2020, representing a recovery of 24.7% from that point. Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT key levels constrain breakout attempts The daily chart displays a relatively narrow trading channel, with DOT fluctuating between its intraday low of $3.30 and high of $3.39. Price action reveals that DOT dipped below its 1-day opening value early in the session but rebounded sharply in the late U.S. and early Asian sessions. The bulls successfully defended the $3.30 support level, initiating a gradual upside that pushed the asset into positive territory. The $3.35 level has now become a vital mid-point marker, as it coincides with a visible area of volume interest and short-term buyer accumulation. DOT Price Chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, hovering just below the 50 level, suggesting balanced momentum without overbought or oversold conditions. The 20-day EMA is flatlining, indicating market indecision and a lack of strong directional momentum. However, price holding above this level signals potential accumulation. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT uptrend builds with higher lows On the 4-hour chart, DOT has been forming a consistent pattern of higher lows, reflecting gradual upward momentum. The asset is attempting to break through the immediate resistance at $3.39 but continues to face rejection near that level. DOT Price Chart The short-term trend favors the bulls as long as the price remains above the $3.32 region. However, failure to clear $3.39 could result in a minor retracement, with interim support visible at $3.34. Volume remains moderate, and a decisive breakout is still lacking. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.13 SELL SMA 5 $4.22 SELL SMA 10 $4.14 SELL SMA 21 $4.31 SELL SMA 50 $4.42 SELL SMA 100 $4.29 SELL SMA 200 $4.54 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.27 SELL EMA 5 $4.25 SELL EMA 10 $4.18 SELL EMA 21 $4.18 SELL EMA 50 $4.43 SELL EMA 100 $4.92 SELL EMA 200 $5.38 SELL What to expect next? Polkadot‚Äôs price structure suggests a critical moment is approaching. With DOT stuck in a tight $3.30‚Äì$3.39 range, a breakout or breakdown from this zone will likely set the tone for its next move. If bulls manage a clean break above $3.39 with volume confirmation, the price could target the next psychological level around $3.45 and potentially extend toward $3.50. Sustained higher lows support this scenario. On the other hand, failure to break resistance could lead to short-term selling pressure. If DOT slips below the $3.32‚Äì$3.30 support band, it may test lower levels near $3.25. Traders should watch closely for volume spikes and price reaction at these key levels, as they will determine whether DOT continues consolidating or starts a directional trend. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot offers strong long-term potential with its unique multi-chain architecture and focus on interoperability. Its technology continues to attract developers and attention in the blockchain space. However, DOT is still down nearly 94% from its all-time high, reflecting broader market weakness and competitive pressures. While long-term prospects remain solid, short-term gains depend on a breakout above key resistance levels. It suits long-term holders more than short-term traders unless volatility increases. Why is Polkadot Up today? Polkadot (DOT) is up 1.36% today, trading at $3.35 as of June 28th, 2025. The price increase is driven by renewed buyer interest near the $3.30 support level, which held firm during recent sessions. This rebound comes as traders respond to DOT forming higher lows on the intraday charts, signaling building bullish pressure. The asset‚Äôs move toward the $3.39 resistance suggests growing optimism, but buyers are still awaiting a confirmed breakout to gain stronger momentum. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If favorable market conditions continue, we could see a bullish trend, and Polkadot has the potential to recover.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021.

The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement.

DOGE has proven that even the most unlikely coins can make people rich, from its inception as a joke to its massive rise that has made millionaires. However, with Dogecoin now maturing and its early days behind it, investors are seeking the next big opportunity. If you missed the DOGE rocket, all hope is not lost. The next ‚ÄúDogecoin moment‚Äù might be brewing right now in projects that combine innovative tech with strong narratives and active communities. Below are eight promising alternatives‚Äîled by the game-changing Little Pepe (LILPEPE)‚Äîthat could deliver outsized returns and potentially mint the next wave of crypto wealth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Next 5000% Moonshot? In the realm of presale tokens, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is stealing the spotlight with a potent mix of humor, high-performance tech, and unapologetic community spirit. While most memecoins stop at the meme, LILPEPE goes full throttle into infrastructure, launching its own Layer-2 blockchain aimed at scalability, speed, and zero transaction tax. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with over $2.5 million raised and more than 2.25 billion tokens sold, LILPEPE is gaining momentum rapidly. At $0.0013 per token, it offers ground-floor pricing for a project that experts speculate could surge over 7000% post-launch, especially if it captures even a fraction of the memecoin mania that lifted DOGE or SHIB. But LILPEPE isn‚Äôt just about early bird gains. It features: A supply of 100 billion tokens Zero tax on buys and sells Its own Layer-2 EVM chain built for meme utility No rug pulls, just green candles. And for those feeling lucky? LILPEPE is running a $777,000 giveaway , with $77,000 in tokens going to each of ten winners. Entry requires a minimum presale contribution of just $100 via the website littlepepe.com, where you can also complete social media tasks for bonus chances. With a clever story (‚ÄúPepe the OG‚Äôs heir fights high gas fees with dank memes‚Äù) and a roadmap that includes listings on top exchanges, influencer-driven virality, and staking rewards, LILPEPE isn‚Äôt just another frog in the pond‚Äîit‚Äôs the memecoin metamorphosis we didn‚Äôt know we needed. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Veteran Challenger Rebuilding for a Second Run Shiba Inu may already be a household name in the meme token world, but it‚Äôs far from done. After a brutal downtrend that saw SHIB shed a significant portion of its market cap, the token is showing signs of life, and technical analysts are eyeing a major breakout. Currently trading near $0.0000107, SHIB has formed a double bottom pattern ‚Äî a bullish signal that, historically, has preceded explosive moves. The neckline at $0.000017 is key. A confirmed breakout could push SHIB towards $0.0000283 or even $0.0000322 ‚Äî a gain of over 150% from current levels. Source: Tradingview With a strong community, continued development on Shibarium (its own Layer-2 solution), and aggressive marketing, SHIB remains one of the strongest meme narratives still in play. It may never hit $1, but even modest rebounds can generate huge profits in the world of fractions-of-a-penny tokens. Avalanche (AVAX): A Layer-1 Sleeping Giant Ready to Wake Up Unlike the meme-heavy picks on this list, Avalanche (AVAX) is a fundamentally strong Layer-1 network. But don‚Äôt let that fool you ‚Äî AVAX could deliver Doge-like returns for one simple reason: its valuation doesn‚Äôt reflect its growth. AVAX is powering millions of daily transactions, with growing traction in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Analysts see a massive wedge pattern forming on long-term charts ‚Äî the kind that often leads to parabolic breakouts. With support holding strong and a bullish engulfing candle recently forming near $15.70, momentum is quietly building. Source: Tradingview If AVAX breaks out of the $19.50 resistance, the path toward $128 and beyond is open‚Äîa 500%+ gain in the medium term, with far more upside as the market recovers. Sui (SUI): The Hidden Gem Turning Heads with Technical Reversal SUI is the definition of an underrated gem. After being pushed down for months, it rallied off the $2.40 support level, a crucial Fibonacci level, and shot up to about $2.79. This move confirmed a falling wedge breakout, which is one of the most consistent patterns for reversing in the cryptocurrency market. On-chain data is even more encouraging. Whale wallets are accumulating, trading volume is up over 50%, and market cap is climbing. Analysts are targeting $4.50 to $6.20 as the next major resistance zones, representing a 60% to 120% upside from the current level. Source: Tradingview For investors seeking a token with strong fundamentals and technical momentum, SUI stands out as a notable choice. Don‚Äôt be surprised if it becomes one of the best performers of 2025. XRP: The OG Altcoin Poised for a Technical Explosion XRP may not be new, but it‚Äôs still one of the most misunderstood‚Äîand potentially explosive‚Äîaltcoins on the market. After years of legal woes, Ripple has weathered the SEC storm and is now showing bullish technical signs that hint at a big breakout Currently trading above $2.17, XRP is forming a falling wedge pattern, while indicators such as the MACD and Chaikin Money Flow are flashing green. A breakout above $2.25 could quickly send XRP to $2.69 and even retest $3.40, its previous yearly high.

Dogwifhat (WIF): The Solana-Based Memecoin with a Cult Following Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin within the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an attractive choice for crypto enthusiasts. After a sharp correction, WIF is stabilizing around $0.80. Analysts highlight resistance levels at $0.88 and $0.90, with a potential push to $0.95 if momentum continues to build. Active community engagement and Solana‚Äôs ecosystem support add to WIF‚Äôs appeal. Source: Tradingview Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Rebound Kid of 2025 FLOKI is back on the radar after a long decline. Prices just bounced back from a low of about $0.0000580 to about $0.0000745, and technical indicators show that a trend reversal is on the way. What makes this recovery significant is the volume confirmation and rising open interest, both signs of growing conviction among traders. FLOKI‚Äôs past rallies have been explosive, and with the memecoin market heating up again, this could be the beginning of another one. With bullish momentum building and meme excitement still strong, FLOKI may easily double or triple from here, especially if it returns to its previous highs. ApeCoin (APE): Low Price, High Potential Trading under $0.60, ApeCoin (APE) is one of the cheapest large-cap meme-related tokens in the market right now‚Äîand that alone makes it a magnet for value hunters. But it‚Äôs not just the price that‚Äôs attractive. Analysts are projecting 2025 targets of $1.49 to $1.62, representing a 150%+ upside. Bullish scenarios could see APE even hitting $2 if broader altcoin cycles kick in. With ties to the Bored Ape Yacht Club (one of the most iconic NFT brands in existence), APE has real brand equity‚Äîa rarity among memecoins. As NFTs and metaverse narratives return, APE could be one of the biggest comeback stories in the space. Final Thoughts: Which One‚Äôs the Next DOGE? Dogecoin‚Äôs rise was part meme, part madness, and all momentum. But the crypto landscape has evolved. Now, investors are looking for coins that not only entertain but also build infrastructure, community, and value.

Lee said that stablecoins are widely accepted not only in the digital world but also in the real world, and that developments in this area increase the value of blockchains such as Ethereum. According to Lee, stablecoins have reached a total market cap of $250 billion as of today, and growth in this area is still in its infancy. Stablecoin issuers earn interest on the collateral deposited (usually in US dollars), but this income is not yet shared with users. This makes the stablecoin business model very attractive to banks, payment companies, and large retailers. Stablecoin usage offers significant advantages for sellers, especially in terms of low transaction costs and eliminating risks such as ‚Äúchargeback‚Äù. It also provides access to a wide range of users who do not use credit cards. Lee said that 80% of stablecoin transaction volume occurs outside the US, with Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan accounting for 40% of this volume. He noted that USDT is traded above $1 in some countries and is even used in real estate transactions. Stating that the US government also adopted stablecoins due to two main structural benefits, Lee said that the first of these is the global dominance of the dollar: USD accounts for 27% of global GDP, 57% of the central bank reserves, 88% of liquid financial markets, It constitutes 100% of stablecoins. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Delivers Harsh Criticism for Surprise Altcoin He argued that as more assets are traded on the blockchain, demand for stablecoins will increase, which in turn will increase global demand for dollars. The second benefit is that stablecoins are now the 12th largest holder of US Treasury bonds, with Tether (USDT) holding more US bonds than even Germany. According to Lee, stablecoins are at the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù where financial services and crypto meet. New generations of users expect their banks to be crypto-friendly. This has led institutions like Robinhood, Circle, Coinbase, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to integrate cryptocurrencies into their balance sheets. In this context, assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are also expected to play an important role. Ethereum stands out as the layer-1 blockchain where the majority of stablecoins are minted. The majority of real-world assets (such as stablecoins, tokenized stocks, and real estate) are traded on Ethereum. Today, 30% of Ethereum network fees come from stablecoins. According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent‚Äôs prediction, the stablecoin market could exceed $2 trillion. This would mean a 10x increase in Ethereum‚Äôs network revenues. Lee noted that these developments present great opportunities not only for Ethereum (ETH) but also for other layer-1 projects like Solana (SOL) and companies that ‚Äúhold crypto in the treasury‚Äù that generate returns through staking. *This is not investment advice.

Successful Audit and Holders‚Äô Hype Put This Token on the Charts Path,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-overtake-avalanche-avax-successful-audit-and-holders-hype-put-this-token-on-the-charts-path/,"Avalanche (AVAX) has long been a standout in the cryptocurrency space, known for its speed, scalability, and resilience. Yet, it appears a new contender is preparing to rival its position at the top. Ruvi AI (RUVI) , with its combination of cutting-edge technology, utility-based functionality, and enthusiastic early backers, is shaping up to be a strong candidate to challenge AVAX. Fueling this momentum is Ruvi AI‚Äôs impressive presale achievements, including $2 million raised , over 170 million tokens sold , and a growing base of 1,700+ holders . Coupled with a successful audit and a clear focus on real-world applications , Ruvi AI is well on its way to carving out a top spot on the cryptocurrency charts. What Gives Ruvi AI the Edge Over Avalanche? The key to Ruvi AI‚Äôs growing popularity lies in its utility-driven approach . Where AVAX revolutionized crypto transactions by emphasizing speed and scalability, Ruvi AI adds further value by addressing challenges in major industries through its blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) integration . This adds a unique, problem-solving angle that few projects can rival. Real-World Applications Driving Demand Ruvi AI creates tangible value by solving real-world issues across the following industries: Marketing : Businesses can use Ruvi AI‚Äôs AI-powered tools to refine ad targeting, optimize campaign effectiveness, and reduce wasted ad spending. This makes marketing efforts more efficient and impactful. Entertainment : Content creators benefit from blockchain-backed payment solutions, ensuring secure monetization. Meanwhile, AI-driven insights help them better connect with audiences and increase engagement. Finance : Ruvi AI enhances transaction transparency and fraud detection while simplifying operational processes for financial institutions. With practical use cases across diverse sectors, Ruvi AI ensures consistent demand for its token, differentiating itself from projects that rely purely on speculative hype. A Presale That Signals Big Things to Come One of the strongest indicators of Ruvi AI‚Äôs potential is its presale success. Here are a few standout numbers: $2 million raised , reflecting strong investor confidence. Over 170 million tokens sold , demonstrating a robust market response. A growing 1,700+ holder community , showing increasing adoption and engagement. Such accomplishments suggest a strong foundation for Ruvi AI‚Äôs future performance, catching the attention of seasoned investors and analysts alike. Growth Trajectory and ROI Potential Ruvi AI stands out with its predictable growth model , an attribute that many other cryptocurrencies lack. Currently priced at $0.015 per token during Phase 2 presale , Ruvi AI offers a low-risk entry point for investors. Post-presale, the token will see its price increase to $0.07 , guaranteeing an almost 5x return for early buyers. Analysts forecast even better returns after its listing, with a predicted value of $1 per token , equating to a 66x ROI . By taking advantage of Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP investment tiers, profits could scale even higher. Unlock Maximum Gains With VIP Tiers Ruvi AI rewards early backers with VIP investment tiers that offer notable bonuses, significantly amplifying profits. Here‚Äôs how they break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers not only reward early adopters but also showcase the immense profit potential Ruvi AI provides at its current valuation. Transparency and Security as Catalysts for Growth Transparency and security are pivotal in building trust among crypto investors, and Ruvi AI has ensured both. The project has successfully undergone a third-party audit by CyberScope , which validated the safety of its smart contracts. Meanwhile, Ruvi AI‚Äôs partnership with the WEEX Exchange ensures post-presale liquidity , enabling seamless token trading and boosting investor confidence. These initiatives separate Ruvi AI from its peers, making it one of the most reliable opportunities in a growing market. Can Ruvi AI Overtake Avalanche? While Avalanche‚Äôs track record is undeniably impressive, Ruvi AI‚Äôs utility-driven roadmap, tangible real-world applications, and transparent operations give it the potential to rival and perhaps even surpass AVAX in the long run. Starting at a price of $0.015 , with a guaranteed increase to $0.07 , and a forecasted value of $1 , Ruvi AI offers unparalleled ROI opportunities. With $2 million raised , over 170 million tokens sold , and a rapidly growing supporter base, Ruvi AI is proving that it has all the ingredients for sustained success.

46977587,https://thecoinrise.com/gemini-rolls-out-tokenized-stock-trading-in-eu/,1751144409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/46977587.jpeg,Gemini Rolls Out Tokenized Stock Trading in EU,https://thecoinrise.com/gemini-rolls-out-tokenized-stock-trading-in-eu/,"Gemini, a well-known crypto exchange, has recently introduced tokenized shares of Strategy (MSTR) to its European Union (EU) users. These tokenized shares are backed by fundamental U.S. equities, giving investors the same financial benefits as owning traditional stocks. This marks the beginning of a larger plan to bring U.S. securities to the blockchain, making them more accessible to people worldwide. Gemini Unveils A New Way to Invest in U.S. Stocks Gemini‚Äôs tokenized MSTR shares are made possible through a partnership with Dinari, a tokenization platform. These shares are turned into tokens on the blockchain but are backed by actual U.S. stocks. This would allow users to buy small portions of shares using their cryptocurrency wallets . At launch, MSTR tokens will be available on the Arbitrum (ARB) network, which offers fast and low-cost transactions. Gemini has also announced that it will soon add support for additional networks, making the tokenized stocks even more accessible. Breaking Barriers with Tokenized Stocks This new offering is designed to make investing in U.S. stocks easier for people around the world. In many countries, users face challenges such as the high cost of converting local currency to U.S. dollars and the difficulty of opening a brokerage account. However, by turning stocks into blockchain tokens, Gemini aims to open up access to the U.S. market. These tokenized shares enable users to purchase small portions of a stock, making it more affordable to invest. Unlike traditional stock markets, these tokens can be traded 24/7 and settle quickly on the blockchain, reducing delays and fees. These tokens also give holders the same financial rights as regular shares, if allowed by law. Gemini Says More Tokenized Stocks on the Way Gemini said MSTR is just the beginning. The company, which is planning to go public , aims to add more tokenized stocks and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) shortly. Its goal is to export U.S. equities globally, enabling people everywhere to participate in financial markets without borders. This move is part of a larger effort to update old financial systems by using blockchain to manage and settle trades faster and more efficiently. Gemini is one of the few major exchanges bringing tokenized stocks to compliance-focused regions. This launch occurs as more financial institutions explore how to utilize digital asset networks for settling and holding traditional securities. As more people seek flexible, global investment options, Gemini‚Äôs tokenized stocks could help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the world of crypto. Experts also predict that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization could grow to over $600 billion in assets under management by 2030.

Analysts are increasingly confident in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term trajectory, citing network upgrades, developer activity, and protocol integrations as strong drivers behind the Ethereum price prediction 2030. Technical indicators are mixed in the short term, with moving averages trending down and RSI signaling neutrality, but broader sentiment remains optimistic. Nearly 40% of participants describe themselves as ‚Äúvery bullish‚Äù on ETH, and forecasts project a potential price of $3,070 by the end of the decade based on modest compound growth and continued adoption. But while Ethereum steadily paves its long-term path, Qubetics is preparing for an immediate leap forward. With its final presale stage nearly complete, the protocol is just days away from getting listed on one of the world‚Äôs top 10 exchanges, an event expected to trigger an automatic 20% price increase. Positioned as the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator and offering one of the most developer-friendly toolkits in the space, Qubetics is emerging as a serious contender among this cycle‚Äôs top opportunities. The question isn‚Äôt whether to join, but whether you‚Äôll get in before the last tokens are gone. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Network Activity and Upgrade Impact Ethereum‚Äôs network fundamentals remain healthy, with developer activity, smart contract deployments, DeFi usage, and NFT minting, continuing at elevated levels. Past upgrade cycles, such as the Merge and EIP‚Äë1559 burn mechanisms, have shown that supply pressure and staking incentives can reinforce ETH‚Äôs value. As decentralised finance and on‚Äëchain applications grow, those foundations may support a steady climb toward the $3,000+ zone by 2030. Thus our Ethereum price prediction 2030 scenario hinges on sustained on‚Äëchain demand and evolving staking utility. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Sentiment Meets Scenarios Projection models assume a 5‚ÄØpercent near‚Äëterm rise, echoing user‚Äëentered forecasts that place ETH near $2,407 within days of now. Continuing from that base, analysts envision ETH reaching $2,525 in 2026, $2,652 in 2027, $2,784 in 2028, and anchoring around $3,070 in 2030. Community sentiment, leaning bullish, underpins these outlooks. In these narratives, Ethereum‚Äôs smart‚Äëcontract dominance and network effect work hand in hand toward our long‚Äëterm Ethereum price prediction 2030 target. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Risk Factors and Strategic View That said, macro headwinds, regulatory pressures, competition from layer‚Äë1 rivals, and potential staking lock‚Äëups, remain key risks. Short‚Äëterm trends could remain flat or modestly negative without new catalyst events or partnerships. Yet even under cautious assumptions, Ethereum‚Äôs path toward that $3,000+ horizon by 2030 remains plausible, given present fundamentals and ecosystem momentum underlying our Ethereum price prediction 2030 scenario. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Community and Participation Dynamics Beyond raw price forecasts, Ethereum‚Äôs future will hinge on its community members, developers, and early adopters. On‚Äëchain governance, DeFi protocols, and roll‚Äëup ecosystems all contribute to sustained momentum and value creation. As the protocol matures, its capacity for innovation may amplify the outlook baked into Ethereum price prediction 2030 estimates. Qubetics: Web3 Aggregated Access and IDE Tools Discover Qubetics , the world‚Äôs first web3 aggregator uniting top blockchains under a single interface. It provides two powerful application layers: QubeQode, which delivers drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop components for user authentication, token management, and storage integration; and Qubetics IDE offering form‚Äëbased contract setup and a pre‚Äëwritten code repository, simplifying blockchain integration for developers and non‚Äëtechnical users alike. Imagine a small‚Äëbusiness owner needing a customer rewards token: with QubeQode‚Äôs visual components and IDE‚Äôs form configuration, they deploy a tokenized loyalty program in hours rather than weeks, reducing complexity and accelerating time to value. Qubetics Presale Opportunity Qubetics presale is now in its final public phase (Stage 37), with $TICS priced at $0.3370. Over $18.1‚ÄØmillion raised, more than 28,300 token holders and 516‚ÄØmillion $TICS tokens have been sold. Only 9‚ÄØmillion $TICS tokens remain at this fixed rate before listing. The public sale allocation has surged to 38.55‚ÄØpercent under a streamlined supply of just 1.36‚ÄØbillion tokens, driving scarcity and community‚Äëled governance ahead of a listing price at $0.40 that implies a 20‚ÄØpercent instant return on entry. Serving as a contender for the best crypto presale, this phase grants early buyers real ownership in protocol direction. Analysts highlight limited token supply against growing demand as major catalysts. Listing on a top‚Äë10 global exchange will trigger pricing at $0.40, unlocking immediate ROI and further upside as $TICS gains utility across Qubetics‚Äô multi‚Äëchain aggregation platform. This crypto presale is structured not only for early-stage value but also for long-term scalability. An investor entering with $5,000 at $0.3370 would secure approximately 14,850 $TICS tokens. Upon listing, those tokens become worth $5,940, delivering a $940 gain at 20‚ÄØpercent ROI. If $TICS reaches $5 to $10 in a broader market cycle, such an investment could swell to $74,250 to $148,500. Conclusion Ethereum‚Äôs long‚Äëterm trajectory, anchored in technical signals, network fundamentals, and community sentiment, supports an Ethereum price prediction 2030 of around $3,070. Meanwhile, Qubetics presale presents one of the best crypto presale opportunities today, offering scarcity, community alignment, functional developer tools, and clear listing upside. Act now to join this best crypto presale and gain exposure to Qubetics‚Äô final token distribution, while Ethereum continues on its path toward future growth.

Strong Support Signals a Potential Reversal XRP is currently consolidating above a crucial support zone between $2.00 and $2.10‚Äîa range that coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from its February‚ÄìApril rally. This level, often referred to as the ‚Äúgolden ratio,‚Äù is widely recognized in technical analysis as a prime area for trend reversals. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which sits just below at around $2.00, is also providing dynamic support. In the chart shared by Captain Redbeard, XRP appears to be forming a double bottom, a classic bullish reversal pattern , right above this support band. This structure, if confirmed by a breakout above $2.40‚Äì$2.50 resistance, could mark the beginning of a major upward move. $XRP is ready to bounce from here.. Next stop: $10 ‚Äî see you there! pic.twitter.com/aOKT3Zgyso ‚Äî Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) June 28, 2025 Technical Indicators Turn Bullish Several technical indicators are reinforcing the bullish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is gradually climbing toward the 60 level, showing a recovery in momentum after recent selling pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is on the verge of a bullish crossover, further hinting that XRP could be preparing for a rally. Volume trends also support this view. Selling pressure has declined significantly on recent dips, while buying volume is slowly picking up, suggesting accumulation by long-term investors. A clean break above the 0.382 Fibonacci resistance at $2.46 would likely confirm bullish control and open the way to retesting the $2.80‚Äì$3.00 zone. Macro Factors and Institutional Momentum XRP‚Äôs technical strength is being reinforced by favorable macro and fundamental developments. Ripple‚Äôs strategic advancements are boosting confidence in the long-term value of the XRP Ledger. Additionally, the growing global interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization plays directly into XRP‚Äôs core use case as a liquidity and settlement asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader market sentiment has also improved, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling a more dovish stance and institutions showing increased appetite for digital asset exposure. These factors are creating a more supportive environment for altcoins like XRP. $10 Target: A Long-Term Vision with Growing Traction While Captain Redbeard‚Äôs $10 target may seem ambitious, it reflects a growing belief among XRP proponents that a combination of regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and network utility could eventually drive a massive rally. Historically, XRP has shown it‚Äôs capable of rapid parabolic moves under the right conditions, as seen in 2017 and again in early 2021. For now, XRP‚Äôs ability to hold the $2.00 support and break above nearby resistance levels remains the immediate focus. If bulls succeed, Redbeard‚Äôs forecast could mark the start of XRP‚Äôs next major leg up, and possibly its journey to a two-digit valuation.

During this period, the popular altcoin and a major headliner in the present market cycle has traded as low as $2.35, which is a 56.44% decline from its all-time high of $5.35 in January. Amidst this mayhem, prominent market expert with X pseudonym PlanD has stated the ongoing formation of a bullish dual pattern hints at an incoming explosive price gain in the SUI market. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,500 In Squeeze-Driven Rally ‚Äì But Can It Hold? Technical Combo Sets Stage for SUI Surge ‚Äì Analyst In an X post on June 27, PlanD shares an interesting price analysis that reveals the formation of two bullish patterns ‚Äì the bull pennant and the inverse head and shoulder (H&S) ‚Äì on the SUI daily chart. Both patterns currently form a confluence of technical indicators suggesting the altcoin is preparing for a major price rally as the second half of 2025 approaches. The inverse head and shoulder pattern is a common bullish reversal pattern. Amidst SUI‚Äôs price correction in Q1, the altcoin formed the left shoulder at $2.42 in February and head at $1.74 in April with a recent price bounce off $2.62 appearing to form the right shoulder. PlanD describes $2.62 as a critical support level in this bullish set-up, the validity of which ensures a potential price breakout. In studying PlanD‚Äôs technical analysis, the inverse H&S currently has a neckline of $4.25, breaking past which confirms the bullish price reversal with a price target set at $10.74. Meanwhile, The bull pennant is a common chart pattern marked by a strong price uptrend (flagpole), followed by a descending channel (pennant) that precedes a price breakout similar to the length of the flagpole.

While ADA trading at $0.58, continues to attract long-term capital thanks to its steady development, it‚Äôs Mutuum Finance that‚Äôs fueling real excitement right now. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 50% is already sold out because of huge demand. The project is priced at $0.03. Over $11.3 million has been raised to date and over 12,600 investors have joined. Mutuum Finance is emerging as a serious coin, with projections from community analysts pointing to possible 100x gains by year-end, if momentum continues. If you‚Äôre still wondering what to buy before June ends, this is one token you‚Äôll want on your radar before it becomes a headline. Cardano Holds Steady Near $0.58 as Whale Support Solidifies The trading price of Cardano (ADA) currently stands at $0.5818 and has rebounded after a short drop to as low as $0.56 as the trading volume rises indicating that the bigger players are entering the market to support the price. Still keeping investors at bay as its ADA stays within its limits is the recent Leios update of the network, a feature aimed to boost throughput and scalability. Some trading analysts observe the formation of a bullish technical pattern around this point which may precondition a breakout up to $1.65 in case the support remains strong. With capital flows changing and traders rethinking their portfolio, there is an increasing number of people looking at new DeFi-oriented opportunities, one of which is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Breaks the $11.3 Million Mark Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well on its path to being one of the hottest projects in DeFi. With an astonishing $11.3 million raised and over 12,600 investors already joining, the presale is gaining serious traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already determined official launch price of $0.06, early investors already enjoy a 100% profit before the token is even available for sale. Some even foresee a post-launch price bounce of more than $2.50 before the bull run of 2025 is finished. Adaptive Intelligence Borrowing, a Newly Unlocked DeFi Transaction Security Mutuum Finance is reshaping DeFi with a lending platform built on user control, security, and flexibility. Its two-sided model encourages diverse interactions instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all approach. Investors of the programs with USDT can passively earn heightened income as the interest rates are modified according to the market tendency of Peer-to-Contract without making any direct operation. Trustless, automated, and customizable, Mutuum Finance offers a new standard in DeFi lending, automation without sacrificing control. Mutuum Finance Announces $50,000 Bug Bounty To reinforce security, Mutuum has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK, with rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low, ensuring every vulnerability is addressed. Cardano may be holding firm with whale support near $0.58, but it‚Äôs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that‚Äôs capturing the real alpha-driven attention right now. With over $11.3 million raised and more than 12,600 investors on board in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM is quickly moving from under-the-radar to must-watch status. Priced at just $0.03, early buyers are positioned for up to 2x gains before launch, and analysts are eyeing 100x potential by year-end. As whale capital starts rotating into high-upside DeFi plays, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Secure your spot before the next price jump.

Having already raised $2 million and sold over 170 million tokens , Ruvi AI‚Äôs rapid progress positions it as a compelling alternative for serious investors. Why Dogecoin Holders Are Eyeing Ruvi AI Dogecoin‚Äôs lack of utility has been its Achilles‚Äô heel, relying heavily on social media hype for price momentum.

It offers smart, scalable solutions across industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance , positioning it as a utility-driven token capable of sustained growth.

But in 2025, smart choices depend on a project‚Äôs long-term plan, strong backing, and real use cases. It‚Äôs no longer about following the loudest voice; it‚Äôs about finding the altcoins that can deliver. In this blog, you‚Äôll explore four standout altcoins that are doing just that: BlockDAG, Cosmos, Polygon, and Algorand. Each project shows a clear purpose and strong progress, making them worth a closer look. Keep reading to see how these projects are building value and why they belong on your list of the best altcoins to buy now. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Why $325M Raised Supports Real Growth BlockDAG tops this list not due to hype but because of the clear need behind its funding. The project has now raised $325 million, aiming for a $600 million goal. This is powering a major rollout, including 20+ centralised exchange listings, ASIC miner delivery, and a growing developer rewards system. Batch 29 is now open, priced at $0.0276, with 23.3 billion coins sold. Buyers from Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% return. There is a special offer for a limited time at $0.0080. BlockDAG is building a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) system. This design supports faster transactions and fits perfectly with future DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure) and AI-based networks. Other projects may rely on flashy promises. BlockDAG is funding real tech, hardware, on-chain features, and liquidity. This makes it one of the best altcoins to buy now for those looking at long-term potential and real utility, not just another marketing splash. 2. Cosmos (ATOM): Practical Blockchain Interoperability Cosmos earns its place as one of the best altcoins to buy now thanks to its strong Layer-0 role. Instead of competing with Ethereum or Bitcoin, Cosmos connects blockchains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Developers can create app-specific chains that still interact easily with other chains. Cosmos focuses on flexibility, not control. It works with chains like Terra, Secret Network, and Osmosis, offering a modular solution that many projects now seek. In today‚Äôs crowded Layer-1 market, Cosmos‚Äô horizontal scaling approach stands out. As more developers embrace multi-chain projects, Cosmos‚Äô framework becomes more valuable. It‚Äôs a practical and forward-thinking choice for anyone looking at the best altcoins to buy now with long-term utility. 3. Polygon (MATIC): Reliable Ethereum Scaling Polygon continues to lead the pack in Ethereum scaling. With hundreds of dApps running and big brands like Starbucks, Nike, and Reddit using it for Web3, Polygon offers proven scalability and compatibility. Its system supports multiple scaling methods, Plasma, zk-rollups, and Optimistic rollups, giving developers more flexibility. As Ethereum handles more transactions with lower fees, Polygon remains a dependable bridge. Polygon deserves its spot as one of the best altcoins to buy now because of its real-world use and strong ecosystem. As tokenisation grows, Polygon‚Äôs role only strengthens. It isn‚Äôt riding a wave of hype; it‚Äôs an essential part of Ethereum‚Äôs scaling future. 4. Algorand (ALGO): Built for Real-World Finance Algorand is becoming a top choice for those seeking regulated and eco-friendly blockchain solutions. Its Pure Proof-of-Stake system, low latency, and carbon-negative status make it a favourite among institutions. A key strength is Algorand‚Äôs focus on real-world projects, from helping El Salvador‚Äôs blockchain rollout to enabling cross-border payments. It values compliance, speed, and scalability over marketing trends. For readers searching for the best altcoins to buy now, Algorand offers a sound option. It‚Äôs built for financial use, with both technical strength and legal readiness. As more industries adopt blockchain, Algorand‚Äôs quiet but steady progress puts it in a strong position. Wrap Up! In the world of crypto, not every project is equal. The smartest move when picking the best altcoins to buy now is to look for projects with strong funding, clear purpose, and growth-ready designs. BlockDAG leads this list because its $325 million raised backs a complex, large-scale plan. Cosmos offers unmatched blockchain interoperability. Polygon supports Ethereum‚Äôs growing needs. Algorand targets institutional markets with regulatory care. Each of these four altcoins earns its place not through empty talk but through action, structure, and purpose. That‚Äôs why they stand out today among the best altcoins to buy now, and why they could shape the future of crypto.

46982228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=779424,1751151610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46982228.jpeg,Bitcoin And Ethereum Coinbase Premium Remains Positive For 7 Weeks ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-coinbase-premium-positive-seven-weeks/,"The cryptocurrency market ‚Äî specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum ‚Äî has performed quite well in the second quarter of 2025, which is a stark contrast to the first quarter‚Äôs performance. The premier cryptocurrency capitalized on this bullish momentum, jumping to a new all-time high above the $111,000 mark. Similarly, the price of Ethereum started its own resurgence and reclaimed the $2,000 mark in early May, albeit the altcoin has been stuck in a consolidation range over the past month. Despite the brewing market uncertainty due to the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to stay afloat. US Investors Keep Crypto Prices Afloat In a new post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that United States investors have been active in the market over the past few weeks. The crypto analyst explained that this correlates with the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices withstanding bearish pressure in recent weeks. Related Reading: You Won‚Äôt Believe Who‚Äôs Moving Millions in Bitcoin on Binance Right Now This on-chain observation is based on the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks the difference between the crypto prices on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and global Binance exchange (USDT pair). This metric reflects the sentiment of the US institutional entities (the major players on Coinbase) compared to those on global exchanges. Typically, when the price premium on Coinbase has a positive value, it implies increasing demand from US investors, who are willing to spend more than other global investors to buy cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum, in this case). On the flip side, the Coinbase Premium Index falling beneath the zero mark signals that US investors are buying less compared to the global traders. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index (excluding the abrupt dip in BTC on May 29) has been in the positive territory since May 9, 2024. This 47-day streak suggests high buying activity from US institutional investors despite geopolitical tensions. Kesmeci added: In the U.S., institutional investors and Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF investors (except for Fidelity) continue their heavy purchases through Coinbase (and have been for weeks). This is why Coinbase Premiums are showing strong positive momentum. Because of this (in my opinion), despite the crises, we haven‚Äôt seen a sharp drop in Bitcoin or Ethereum in the market. In essence, the on-chain analyst believes the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have been able to weather the storm with the rising tensions in Asia because US investors have been active in the market. Naturally, risk assets tend to succumb to bearish pressure during unstable conditions like wars, global pandemics, and so on. Bitcoin & Ethereum Price As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,100, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Ether token is valued at around $2,420, with a mere 0.6% price jump in the past day.

It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it‚Äôs working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high.

Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time.

While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won‚Äôt last forever‚Äîso if you‚Äôre interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong options, but XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as the first sports memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth with its unique blend of memes and sports.

46982524,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72907,1751151927,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Is Set for 700% Price Rally. Here‚Äôs why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-set-for-700-price-rally-heres-why/,"Renowned market analyst EGRAG Crypto has identified technical signals suggesting that XRP could rise significantly in the near term. Drawing from historical patterns, EGRAG now projects a potential surge to $17.5, citing similarities between XRP‚Äôs current price behavior and its movements during previous bullish cycles. His latest technical analysis places particular focus on XRP‚Äôs interaction with the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator often used by traders to evaluate trend strength and momentum shifts. The Role of the 21-Week EMA in Past XRP Rallies According to EGRAG, XRP‚Äôs price trajectory during the 2020‚Äì2021 market cycle shows parallels with current market conditions. In early 2020, the token dropped below the 21-week EMA, eventually bottoming out at approximately $0.1140 in March of that year. For 19 consecutive weeks, the EMA acted as a major resistance level. #XRP ‚Äì Why $17.5 Is a Simple Yet Powerful Target! : Looking back at the 2021 cycle, many underestimated #XRP ‚Äôs massive Pumps but the numbers tell a different story. By examining the percentage moves from various pumps in relation to the Exponential Moving Average (EMA),‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/19F9gR30sZ ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 25, 2025 That resistance was finally broken in July 2020, leading to a strong rally that saw XRP climb to $0.79 by November. This represented an increase of over 590% from the cycle low. However, the asset faced resistance again at that peak and entered a multi-week consolidation phase. During the consolidation, XRP maintained close interaction with the 21-week EMA , which had shifted from resistance to support. This stability at the EMA set the stage for another surge in early 2021, when the asset climbed from a February low of $0.3684 to a high of $1.96 by April. This move marked an increase of roughly 432%. EGRAG emphasized that many observers had underestimated XRP‚Äôs strength during that cycle. However, the data demonstrated otherwise. Current Market Structure Mirrors Previous Cycle In his recent analysis, EGRAG notes that XRP is again showing behavior similar to what was observed in the 2020‚Äì2021 period. The token broke above the 21-week EMA in November 2024, following a market-wide uptrend driven by broader macro events. From a base of $0.50, XRP surged to $3.40, reflecting a gain of 580%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A corrective phase followed in February 2025, placing XRP in a consolidation zone where it has frequently tested the 21-week EMA as support, mirroring the pattern seen in late 2020. EGRAG now anticipates that this consolidation will precede a new rally, similar to the second wave observed in 2021. He predicts that XRP could rise as high as $17.5 during this next leg, which would represent an increase of nearly 695% from its valuation of $2.20 (at the time of prediction). This projection is based on analyzing previous rallies about the asset‚Äôs behavior around the 21-week EMA. Market Sentiment and Timing Considerations At the time of reporting, XRP is trading at approximately $2.13, showing a weekly gain of 5.42% after recovering from recent price volatility. When asked to provide a specific timeframe for the anticipated surge, EGRAG cautioned against attempts to precisely predict timing. Instead, he stressed the importance of understanding broader market trends and technical signals. EGRAG Crypto‚Äôs analysis presents a technically grounded case for a possible XRP rally to $17.5, based on well-established patterns and historical market behavior. While price movements in crypto markets remain highly unpredictable, the consistency between past and present structures adds weight to the possibility of significant upward momentum for XRP in the coming months.

Each of these tokens rides a unique wave, from oracle integrations and proof-of-stake scalability to multi-chain wallet technology. But only one of them is in the final stages of a presale that‚Äôs already sold more than half a billion tokens. Qubetics ($TICS) is not just another token. It addresses a long-standing pain point in the crypto world‚Äîthe lack of seamless interoperability, cross-chain transactions, and user-controlled privacy. At the core of its promise is a non-custodial multi-chain wallet that makes switching between blockchains feel like navigating tabs in a browser. And as this emerging platform gears up for a major exchange listing at $0.40, it is becoming one of the top cryptos to invest in this week. Qubetics Wallet Tech Makes It a Major Contender Among Top Cryptos to Invest in This Week As blockchain users demand smoother, safer, and more autonomous control over their digital assets, Qubetics enters the frame with a solution long overdue‚Äîa fully decentralised, non-custodial multi-chain wallet built for both beginners and experienced Web3 users. Picture this: a design studio in Brooklyn using Solana-based NFTs to verify ownership of their art while collaborating with a dev team on Polygon. Normally, that would involve several apps, wallets, and exchange interfaces. With Qubetics‚Äô wallet, these actions happen inside one platform, with the added bonus of private key ownership and zero central oversight. Now imagine a fintech firm in Toronto running multiple stablecoins across BNB, Ethereum, and Stellar‚ÄîQubetics streamlines the chaos with one click swaps, built-in bridge technology, and cold-storage grade security. As interoperability becomes the backbone of next-gen DeFi and dApp expansion, Qubetics makes its mark by integrating cross-chain compatibility, zero-knowledge proof security, and permissionless control under one clean UI. For participants seeking the top cryptos to invest in this week , the ability to unify multiple chains into one controllable interface is a compelling differentiator. Why the Qubetics Presale Is Drawing Attention from Across the Ecosystem With over $18.1 million raised, more than 516 million $TICS tokens sold, and 28,300 holders already onboard, the Qubetics presale has become one of the most anticipated token sales of the year. Currently in Stage 37 and priced at $0.3370, the presale is inching closer to its conclusion, as less than 9 million tokens remain at this level. A full supply reduction from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion tokens, with 38.55% allocated to the public, sets a clear tone of scarcity and measured growth. The platform has already demonstrated strong demand. A participant contributing $5,500 at the current price would receive around 16,323 tokens. If $TICS hits $1 post-listing, that $5,500 becomes $16,323. But if $TICS scales to $5, that same bag grows to over $81,615. And should the token push to $10 or $15 during the next cycle, the holdings could be worth $163,230 or $244,845 respectively. For those looking to enter before the wider market does, Qubetics is making a hard case as one of the top cryptos to invest in this week. What really draws attention is the upcoming exchange debut. Analysts suggest a 20% price increase upon listing on a top 10 global exchange, sparking a potential momentum shift. With the Qubetics presale closing in, and token access soon shifting entirely to the open market, the urgency among early adopters is accelerating fast. Key Launch Milestones to Watch Public Sale End: June 30, 8 AM UTC Exchange Listing: June 30, 11 AM UTC Launch Price: $0.40 With these milestones set, and the infrastructure already battle-tested, the Qubetics presale now represents one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities available. It‚Äôs not just a speculative asset‚Äîit‚Äôs a functioning utility token inside a working Web3 environment. Chainlink Secures Its Place with Real-World Oracle Power Chainlink (LINK) has long operated as the go-to name for decentralized data infrastructure. But recent activity suggests that the project is evolving beyond simple oracle services and into the broader domain of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, institutional finance, and DeFi composability. In June, Chainlink announced new integrations with Avalanche and Base, enhancing cross-chain interoperability for dApps that rely on external data feeds. Additionally, its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is now being explored by traditional banks and payment networks to bridge the gap between blockchain-native and real-world finance. This expansion mirrors the goals of SWIFT‚Äôs experiments with Chainlink‚Äôs technology, which have quietly advanced behind the scenes. With continued upgrades to staking models and new enterprise partnerships underway, LINK is beginning to reassert itself not only as a vital infrastructure layer but also as a token with strong upside potential. While Qubetics handles user control and UX optimization, Chainlink provides backend data plumbing that DeFi simply can‚Äôt run without. For anyone scanning the horizon for the top cryptos to invest in this week, LINK‚Äôs comeback momentum is worth noting. SUI Is Rising Thanks to Developer Growth and Network Expansion SUI is not a household name yet, but it‚Äôs quickly becoming one in dev circles. Born from Mysten Labs, SUI uses the Move language and focuses on horizontal scaling, enabling massive throughput and fast settlement times. That matters a lot when developers are building high-volume apps that cannot tolerate lag or congestion. Over the past 30 days, SUI has seen a 22% rise in active developers and a 17% increase in wallet registrations. New gaming and DeFi projects are onboarding fast, and the network‚Äôs gas efficiency is making it particularly appealing to builders experimenting with NFTs, payments, and social dApps. A recent uptick in trading volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) signals that the chain is entering a new stage of adoption. While it lacks the name recognition of Ethereum or even Solana, SUI‚Äôs underlying tech is being noticed for its performance. The chain‚Äôs bullish chart activity coincides with growing TVL, suggesting organic growth rather than hype cycles. This makes SUI a serious candidate for anyone evaluating the top cryptos to invest in this week from a long-term innovation standpoint. Final Thoughts: Which One‚Äôs the Right Pick Among the Top Cryptos to Invest in This Week? Each of the three tokens covered here offers something different. Chainlink powers the data infrastructure that lets smart contracts do their job. SUI builds out a scalable, efficient layer for next-gen dApps. And Qubetics? It tackles a critical issue with blockchain usability‚Äîinteroperability and control‚Äîby offering a wallet that bridges ecosystems without giving up security or decentralization. Yet, the Qubetics presale has a uniquely timed advantage. With a launch price of $0.40, an anticipated 20% listing bump, and a presale tally now over $18.1 million, this may be the best crypto presale currently live. Participants getting in before the June 30 cutoff will be ahead of the wider exchange exposure. While LINK and SUI are solid plays backed by working ecosystems, Qubetics combines utility, urgency, and upside, making it a strong contender among the top cryptos to invest in this week. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics one of the top cryptos to invest in this week?

Summary Qubetics, Chainlink, and SUI are emerging as the top cryptos to invest in this week , each offering distinct value propositions. Qubetics is nearing a major exchange listing at $0.40 with a projected 20% price surge, driven by its groundbreaking non-custodial multi-chain wallet and a presale that has already raised over $18.1 million. Chainlink continues to solidify its dominance in oracle services, expanding into real-world asset integrations and enterprise adoption.

As a result, the 14th-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization is eyeing a bullish run to the psychological price of $17. Market analyst Tektonic pointed out, ‚ÄúThe price structure indicates the formation of a potential continuation pattern, with $13.50 acting as immediate resistance. A confirmed breakout above this level could open the path toward the $14.50‚Äì$15.00 region in the short term.‚Äù Source: Tektonic LINK is building a strong base at the $13.15 zone, which might ignite the fire needed to hit the $15 price target. Chainlink and Mastercard Partnership Seeks to Bridge the Gap Between Traditional Finance and Crypto Mastercard and Chainlink recently partnered to launch Swapper Finance, enabling users to buy crypto directly from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with any Mastercard. This groundbreaking partnership marked the first time any crypto can be purchased on-chain using traditional cards. As a result, Mastercard‚Äôs 3.5 billion cardholders will have the opportunity to buy crypto directly on Uniswap, thanks to instant, secure crypto-to-fiat conversion. Therefore, the Chainlink and Mastercard collaboration seamlessly bridges DeFi with mainstream and traditional finance (TradFi). Meanwhile, Chainlink launched the ‚ÄòBuild on Solana‚Äô program last month to accelerate Web3 development on Solana through targeted ecosystem incentives and expert technical support. By merging Solana‚Äôs high-speed performance with Chainlink‚Äôs powerful oracles, the program intends to boost scalability and efficiency for apps in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs.

The six-time NBA champion recently disclosed his crypto watchlist, spotlighting Shiba Inu (SHIB) and XRP among his top choices for the anticipated bull cycle. Amidst ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market, many investors and public figures have begun publicly identifying tokens they believe have strong potential for gains shortly. Pippen‚Äôs selections add to the growing discussion surrounding altcoins that may outperform during the next rally. SHIB and XRP Lead Pippen‚Äôs Altcoin Focus Alongside Bitcoin, which remains the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Pippen mentioned that he is watching several altcoins he believes could perform strongly. These include Shiba Inu and XRP, which he considers standout assets going into the bull market. He also noted his interest in Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Game5Ball. Besides Bitcoin, what coins are you watching this BULL run? I got my picks, $ETH $SOL $BNB $XRP $Ball aka @Game5Ball $ADA $DOGE $SHIB $LINK What else you got? Drop your crypto picks. ‚Äî Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) June 27, 2025 This diverse list suggests Pippen is considering both established altcoins and emerging projects in his market outlook. Previous Support for XRP and Shiba Inu Pippen‚Äôs interest in XRP and SHIB is not new. Earlier this year, he publicly expressed confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, indicating that he views the asset as a strong candidate for long-term growth. His endorsement stirred discussion among his followers, with some speculating that XRP may even outperform Ethereum during the next bull run, expected in 2025. In May, Pippen reiterated his bullish stance on Shiba Inu, naming it among the key tokens to watch as he declared that ‚ÄúAltcoin Season‚Äù had begun. This reinforced his view that SHIB remains a strong contender despite market corrections. Current Price Trends and Analyst Projections Since Pippen voiced his optimism, both XRP and SHIB have experienced price declines. Over the past 30 days, XRP has fallen by 6.03%, currently trading at approximately $2.10. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has seen a more substantial drop of 19.93%, with its price currently at $0.00001120. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite these setbacks, many analysts remain positive about the future trajectory of both assets. For Shiba Inu, market analysts such as Javon Marks and Eunice Wong believe the token could rise above $0.0001 during this bull cycle, setting a new all-time high. Regarding XRP, projections vary. Altcoin Moe predicts that the token could reach $5 by the end of 2025. However, other commentators consider this estimate conservative. Analyst Dustin Layton, for example, suggests that XRP has the potential to climb as high as $50, depending on market conditions and broader adoption trends. While the market remains uncertain in the short term, Scottie Pippen‚Äôs support for XRP and Shiba Inu reflects broader investor sentiment favoring altcoins with strong communities and long-term use cases. As the next bull market approaches, both retail investors and public figures continue to align their strategies with assets they believe are best positioned for growth.

The upturn follows a sharp rally last month, sparked by Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve , which included XRP, Solana, and Cardano. However, as clarifications emerged that the government would not actively acquire additional assets, the market retreated, pushing XRP down over 24.88%. Despite the pullback, analysts remain bullish on XRP‚Äôs long-term trajectory. On Saturday, popular crypto analyst Dark Defender highlighted a ‚ÄúCoffee Cup‚Äù pattern forming on XRP‚Äôs monthly price chart, describing it as a significant bullish signal. He noted that this pattern, combined with Elliott Wave analysis, suggests a dramatic price rally. ‚Äú The coffee cup pattern in markets is a U-shaped formation on a price chart. It indicates a potential bullish trend reversal after a downtrend, typically taking weeks to months to develop fully,‚Äù Dark Defender wrote. ‚ÄúBack at 50 cents, the cup‚Äôs surface tease and depth weren‚Äôt screaming yet, but they are now.‚Äù He further outlined three key price targets based on this setup: a surge to $5.85‚Äì$18.22 in Wave 3, a climb to $36 in Wave 5, and a long-term projection of $44.22 (a 1,965% surge) based on the cup‚Äôs depth. Adding to the bullish outlook, analyst Ali Martinez emphasized XRP‚Äôs critical technical positioning. He pointed out that if XRP avoids closing below the head-and-shoulders neckline and instead breaks above the right shoulder, it could invalidate the bearish setup, potentially triggering a breakout toward $5. Beyond technical analysis, experts anticipate trillions of dollars could flow into XRP, driven by evolving market dynamics and political shifts. Fintech and Web3 expert Jake Claver highlighted the significance of XRP holdings, noting that owning 10,000 XRP places an investor in the top 10% globally. He suggested institutional interest in XRP is growing behind the scenes. ‚ÄúThe big banks aren‚Äôt telling you this because they‚Äôre loading up their own bags,‚Äù Claver stated. ‚ÄúWhen XRP becomes the backbone of global finance, you‚Äôll wish you listened.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs recent announcement of the U.S. ‚ÄòCrypto Strategic Reserve‚Äô has further elevated XRP‚Äôs profile. Yassin Mobarak, a popular XRP community member, even speculated on the possibility of the U.S. accepting XRP for the $125 million fee judgment in Ripple‚Äôs securities lawsuit with the SEC, which could lead to unprecedented governmental alignment with XRP holders. ‚ÄúThat means for the first time in history, the U.S. government will own XRP and therefore will be incentivized to let its value grow over-time. That will mean the shackles that prevented XRP from being used in the U.S. will finally be removed and XRP will finally be allowed to assume the utility it was created for. That in turn will mean positive price movements for $XRP,‚Äù Mobarak wrote .

Despite this disruption, many Telegram-based marketplaces with similar operations remain unaffected and are actively growing. Vendors Shift to Tudou According to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic‚Äôs latest report , Huione Guarantee‚Äôs activity has come to a halt, but its exit has triggered a migration. Vendors are being steered toward Tudou Guarantee, which has absorbed a large share of Huione‚Äôs transactions. Before its abrupt shutdown, Huione Guarantee was operated by the Cambodia-based Huione Group. It was originally launched in 2021 with the intention of facilitating legitimate transactions involving assets like cars and real estate. Over time, however, the platform‚Äôs listings shifted focus. Leading up to its closure, much of Huione Guarantee‚Äôs activity seems geared toward supporting cyber scam operations, The authorities finally dismantled Huione Guarantee on May 13, 2025. This Telegram-based platform processed over $27 billion in transactions, mostly involving tools and services for large-scale online scams like pig butchering. Its downfall followed a detailed investigation by Elliptic, which led Telegram to delete thousands of related channels and ban associated user accounts. Still, Huione Guarantee represented just one node within a sprawling network of Chinese-language guarantee marketplaces. These platforms, thriving on Telegram, allow the exchange of illicit goods such as stolen data, fraudulent tech tools, and money laundering services, which are all vital to scam operations. Huione‚Äôs USDT Activity Nears Zero Transactions are conducted entirely in Tether‚Äôs USDT stablecoin, which ensures the ease of movement and pseudo-anonymity. In fact, Tether froze a Huione-linked wallet in July 2024 due to suspected ties to the North Korean hacking entity, Lazarus Group. After Telegram removed Huione‚Äôs public channels and usernames, the platform formally shut down, advising vendors to migrate to Tudou Guarantee. Initially, Huione claimed it would continue facilitating private escrow services, but by late May, it announced a full cessation of operations. Elliptic said that its blockchain data confirmed this exit, as incoming USDT flows to Huione‚Äôs wallets plummeted to ‚Äúnegligible levels.‚Äù The post Tudou Guarantee Emerges as Key Successor After Huione Darknet Shutdown appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Lazarus Group|Tether (USDT),EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-28 23:45:44

BCH recently crossed key resistance and now targets $710, with solid support at $450. Solana is holding near $145 after rebounding from global news dips. Experts now eye $160‚Äì$200 as ETF talks and high volumes boost momentum. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reshaping crypto rewards. BlockDAG is offering a battle for 100 million BDAG. Through four quests and live leaderboards, users complete tasks like testing smart contracts, social sharing, app installs, and referrals. The top contributors earn real BDAG, making BlockDAG a standout crypto opportunity today. Bitcoin Cash Price Outlook Aims at $700 After Breakout Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has bounced back strongly from $449, now eyeing the $612 to $710 range. The coin recently broke past a major resistance level near $454.74. Currently, $467 is acting as a key pivot; a push above could trigger a faster rally. On the downside, support between $419 and $378 remains firm, giving bulls a solid base. Trading volume has also climbed, driven by both retail and institutional buyers. Since March, BCH has nearly doubled, gaining new momentum in June as macro factors and stronger on-chain utility take hold. The CashTokens upgrade is helping grow real-world use cases for BCH, especially in low-fee payments. With the chart breakout confirmed and rising volatility, analysts are again focused on BCH‚Äôs run toward the $700 zone, a move that could happen if current trends hold. Solana (SOL) Price Surge Eyes $160 After Rebound Solana (SOL) has pushed back above $145 after bouncing from recent lows of $128, which were triggered by geopolitical news. Support is holding around $140‚Äì$143, with resistance near $145 to $146.55. If this range breaks, analysts expect a fast move to $160‚Äì$165. Growing talks around a potential Solana ETF and new institutional inflows are also boosting momentum. Bitget analysts remain bullish, suggesting a $300 long-term target if current volume trends continue. With strong buying signals in place, and $145 possibly turning into support, Solana could rally faster than many expect if the breakout unfolds in the coming weeks. BlockDAG Airdrop Rewards Real Effort With 100M BDAG BlockDAG‚Äôs airdrop isn‚Äôt a handout; it‚Äôs a game of skill. With 100 million BDAG on offer, users aren‚Äôt just collecting coins, they‚Äôre earning them. The competition runs across four quests: testnet, presale, social sharing, and referrals. Each action, from deploying a smart contract to inviting a friend, earns points and moves you up the leaderboard. Top players can earn as much as 10.1 million BDAG. And with the leaderboard resetting every 3 months, the challenge never stops. This smart structure draws real engagement, not bots or fake clicks. Tasks include using the X1 miner app, trying out smart contracts on the testnet, and building coins with the no-code token builder. The more you do, the more BDAG you can earn. The presale adds another layer. BlockDAG is now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. Early buyers from Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% return up to today‚Äôs price. Over $325 million has been raised so far, with 23.3 billion BDAG sold. The launch price is set at $0.05, offering room for gains from here. Also, a limited-time presale offers BDAG at just $0.0080. This gives both early movers and newcomers a window of opportunity. For those tracking standout crypto plays, BlockDAG delivers a unique mix of earning potential and long-term value, verified by audits from CertiK and Halborn, plus coming hardware rollouts. Summary Solana (SOL) is holding steady near $145, with targets set at $160 and beyond as ETF buzz and trading volumes build. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is aiming for $700 after breaking major resistance and gaining fresh momentum. Both are showing strong potential, but BlockDAG is drawing attention for a different reason. Its airdrop isn‚Äôt a simple freebie; it‚Äôs a skill-based challenge. With 100 million BDAG rewards up for grabs, BlockDAG ranks users on leaderboards through smart contract testing, app installs, social activity, and referrals.

A crypto analyst now points to recurring trends observed in past cycles, where Q3 has often acted as a launchpad for significant price rallies in BTC following each halving year. Bitcoin Post-Halving Years Point To Explosive Q3 Luca, a crypto market expert on X (formerly Twitter), has doubled down on expectations for a major Bitcoin price rally in the coming quarter. He argues that expectations of an extended consolidation in Bitcoin, based on the fractals and market behavior seen in 2023 and early 2024, fail to account for a critical factor: 2025 is a post-halving year. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears The analyst points to a consistent pattern observed in every post-halving year throughout Bitcoin‚Äôs history. In his chart analysis published on June 26, Luca notes that Q3 in these years have consistently demonstrated strength, with no historical precedent for weakness, reinforcing the case for a bullish breakout. The chart compares Q3 performance during the post-halving years of 2013, 2017, and 2021. In each case, Bitcoin entered the third quarter with moderate or corrective price action, only to rally significantly in the weeks that followed. The left panel of the chart shows the 2013 post-halving year, where Bitcoin went from under $100 in July to over $680 in November. In 2017, the middle panel highlighted a similar trajectory, where BTC broke out from under $2,800 in early Q3 to over $16,000 by year-end. The most recent cycle in 2021, shown in the right panel of the chart, saw a Q3 recovery rally that took Bitcoin from under $39,000 in July to a former all-time high above $69,000 in November. Notably, Luca maintains that this consistent historical behavior is not coincidental, predicting that a similar rally could unfold in the current cycle, within the next few months. While he acknowledges the possibility of a short-term pullback, he emphasizes that Bitcoin‚Äôs broader market structure remains firmly bullish, with momentum still favoring further upside. Analyst Predicts $140,000 ‚Äì $160,000 Bitcoin Cycle Top Moving forward, Luca‚Äôs chart reveals technical factors that align with his bullish thesis. Based on key Fibonacci Extension levels, the analyst projects that BTC‚Äôs next cycle top falls between $140,000 and $160,000, a target he believes could be attained toward the end of Q3.

With BTC now trading around $107,423 after rebounding from a previous dip below $100,000, a potential move to $140,000 or even $160,000 would mark a substantial gain of approximately 30.35% and 48.97%, respectively.

Prices surge, then stall, waiting on the next news or narrative to move again. But the real edge often lies in setups that are working quietly, before the crowd catches on. XRP is one of those setups. After a 600% rally in 2024, it is now holding at $2.17 with little movement this month. Analysts see signs of accumulation. Near Protocol shows similar tension, with a price dip, but over 46 million monthly users signaling strength beneath the surface. But Web3 ai ($WAI) is not waiting for momentum. It is already building. By combining tools like portfolio insights, market signals, and risk alerts into one live dashboard, it eliminates the clutter slowing crypto decision-making. That clarity is catching on, with its presale already raising more than $8.5 million. XRP Eyes a Breakout as $2.17 Support Holds Firm XRP is once again turning heads as it stabilizes above the $2 mark. After a massive 600% surge in 2024, the token has entered a quieter phase in 2025. So far this June, XRP is down just 0.74%, holding at $2.17. While some see this as stagnation, others view it as calculated positioning before a major breakout. Crypto analyst Michael XBT, known for calling XRP‚Äôs last rally, has suggested the current pause is part of a larger accumulation phase. Market sentiment remains steady, and projections for the next leg of the cycle stretch as high as $30 if momentum returns. Near Protocol Balances Bearish Swings with Real-World Growth NEAR has seen a turbulent start to the month, shedding more than 6% amid broader market jitters linked to geopolitical tensions. Price levels have fluctuated between $2.085 and $2.219, with strong resistance around $2.18 and rising demand near $2.10. The charts suggest a bearish short-term setup, but that is not the full picture. On-chain data shows Near Protocol now boasts over 46 million monthly active users, pointing to growing real-world adoption. This surge in usage presents a sharp contrast to price movement, and may offer a setup for recovery if market pressures begin to fade. Web3 ai Raises $8.5M by Solving Crypto‚Äôs Fragmentation Problem In crypto, the biggest losses often come from distraction, not market crashes. Juggling six tabs to check prices, read news, monitor social sentiment, manage portfolios, and track scams has become routine. But this routine is broken. Every extra click is a delay. Every delay is a missed opportunity. Web3 ai addresses this directly by pulling all of these actions into a single, real-time dashboard. Instead of bouncing between platforms, users get one synced experience. Market signals run next to wallet analytics. Risk metrics appear alongside staking performance. Everything updates live, removing friction from every choice. It is designed for decision-making, not distraction, and that shift is already gaining traction in the crypto community. The numbers prove the interest is real. Web3 ai has already raised $8.5 million in its presale, with nearly 24 billion tokens sold. Stage 9 pricing sits at just $0.000443, while the confirmed listing target is $0.005242. That leaves room for a potential 1747% return for early backers who move before the market catches on. In a space where speed matters more than theory, this project offers more than hype. The tools are already built. The funding is already secured. And the window for entry is still open, for now. Long Story Short Returns in crypto are often less about current prices and more about what is quietly building behind the scenes. XRP is holding strong above $2.17, and if momentum returns, analysts see room to climb as high as $30. Near Protocol is down 6%, but its 46 million monthly users point to fundamentals that are stronger than its short-term chart suggests. Then there is Web3 ai. With $8.5 million raised, 23 billion tokens sold, and a stage 9 price of $0.000443, it is offering a setup that could deliver up to 1747% at launch. For 2025, few top crypto plays are this early.

Tether is rapidly strengthening its global footprint, now ranking among the top holders of U.S. government debt, a clear signal that stablecoins are becoming central players in international finance. Ethereum, meanwhile, is showing cracks under pressure. Large holders have started selling, liquidations are surging, and price action has turned fragile. During all this noise, Unstaked is building. It has raised over $10.6 million, reached Stage 22 of its presale, and continues to attract long-term participants looking for actual product-market fit rather than hype cycles. As attention shifts back to fundamentals and performance, the difference between headline dominance and ecosystem delivery becomes increasingly clear. Tether‚Äôs Treasury Play Signals a New Phase for Stablecoins Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that the company now holds approximately $125 billion in U.S. Treasuries, making it one of the largest holders of U.S. government debt globally, ranking 18th if it were a country. In 2024 alone, Tether became the fifth-largest buyer of Treasuries, reinforcing its strategic positioning in global finance. Ardoino emphasized Tether‚Äôs mission to extend U.S. dollar access to underserved populations, especially in growing markets, through its USDT stablecoin, which acts as a bridge between decentralized assets and traditional banking. The company estimates it could serve up to 420 million people worldwide. He also voiced support for regulatory efforts like the GENIUS Act, which aims to bring clear legal frameworks to the stablecoin sector in the U.S., potentially unlocking further institutional adoption. Tether‚Äôs deepening involvement in traditional finance highlights both its dominance in the stablecoin space and the broader integration of digital currencies into the global monetary system, despite ongoing regulatory challenges. Ethereum Faces Selling Pressure as Whales Exit Positions Ethereum (ETH) is under significant selling pressure after a major whale sold $12.11 million worth of ETH, with $12 million still held, according to Lookonchain. Another wallet reportedly deposited $28.9 million in ETH to Binance, suggesting more potential sell-offs ahead. During this, Ethereum‚Äôs price dropped to $2,240, down 8% in 24 hours and 10% over the past week, making it one of the worst performers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The sell-off triggered massive $300 million in ETH liquidations, mostly from long positions, contributing to the total $712 million in crypto liquidations in a single day. Additional whales have also panic-sold thousands of ETH, compounding market anxiety. Despite positive ETF inflows in the U.S., Ethereum continues to struggle for upward momentum, while Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance climbs to new cycle highs. The altcoin weakness reinforces the narrative that capital is flowing toward Bitcoin during market stress, leaving ETH and others more exposed to volatility. Unstaked at Stage 22: 28x ROI Potential and $10.6M Raised In contrast to both Tether‚Äôs institutional revolve and Ethereum‚Äôs retail capitulation, Unstaked is quietly building a presale success story rooted in utility and transparency. Now in Stage 22, the project has already raised over $10.6 million from early contributors, without celebrity promotions or speculative token drops. Priced at $0.012091, and targeting a launch price of $0.1819, Unstaked offers a rare and clearly framed 28x return window. What sets it apart isn‚Äôt just pricing mechanics, but architecture. Unstaked enables users to deploy autonomous AI agents that manage community engagement and growth across platforms like X (Twitter) and Telegram. These agents interact, optimize, and adapt based on performance, with every action logged via a verifiable Proof of Intelligence framework tied to the owner‚Äôs wallet. No agent = no rewards. That‚Äôs how the system stays merit-based and transparent. Unlike other presales that reward idle holding, Unstaked prioritizes on-chain contribution. To jumpstart its ecosystem, the team has also launched a $1,000,000 giveaway campaign, where 20 winners will each receive $50,000 in $UNSD. Entry is based on completing simple tasks, making referrals, engaging socially, and purchasing at least $100 in tokens, all designed to reward active community building. With multiple exchange listings already confirmed and a product MVP nearing deployment, Unstaked isn‚Äôt trying to chase the next trend. It‚Äôs creating the infrastructure for decentralized engagement at scale, and inviting early contributors to share in its upside. Summing Up! Tether is proving that stablecoins can be powerful geopolitical tools, not just crypto trading pairs. Ethereum, while still fundamentally strong, is currently caught in a technical and emotional downswing as whales flee and long positions get wiped out. These are two sides of a maturing but volatile market. Unstaked, meanwhile, is sidestepping the noise. It‚Äôs not waiting for regulatory green lights or market rotations, it‚Äôs executing. With Stage 22 in progress, $10.6M raised, a $1M rewards program live, and a 28x launch-to-presale upside, it offers a sharp contrast to the reactive strategies seen elsewhere. Cycles shift. Sentiment fades. But projects that ship, and reward contributors meaningfully, continue to gain ground. Unstaked is doing just that.

In a statement, the firm says that an unknown actor gained unauthorized access to the retailer‚Äôs information technology systems, stealing multiple types of data.

While PEPE is making noise with its meme-driven momentum, buzz is building around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi token that‚Äôs quickly gaining traction. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale, now over 45% sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. The project has already raised over $11.3 million, gaining serious momentum even as broader market sentiment leans cautious. Many are now calling MUTM the next crypto to explode. The project could be one of the top tokens set to soar 20x, and it may happen faster than expected. PEPE Coin Pauses After Recent Drop Around $0.0000096 The Pepe‚ÄØCoin (PEPE) price is now at $0.0000096 with a slight 5% drop in the last 24 hours and failure to keep up with the rest of the market. With low-priced and declining open interest, PEPE is currently in the process of consolidation, despite some short-term bullish engulfing trend in the beginning of June. Onchain statistics indicate some profit taking by larger whales, and the asset is in a far cry to the December highs of $0.000028. After the meme-coin run has hit a wall, focus has turned slowly over to newer DeFi options, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making its way under the radar. Mutuum Finance Hits $11.3 Million Funded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the move in popularity terms. With its innovative two-way lending model, this DeFi behemoth has already attracted over 12,600 investors and raised $11.3 million, and it doesn‚Äôt appear to be letting up. The token price of Mutuum Finance will increase to $0.035 in Phase 6, 16.67% up, so those investors who get on board here are in for massive profits. Mutuum Finance Lending: Smarter, Simpler, Decentralized Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, offering users secure returns from USDT pools via the P2C platform and complete ownership of direct crypto transfer via the P2P platform. These lending protocols provide end-to-end seamless DeFi experience ideally tailored to user requirements and safer, more transparent, and more configurable than the standard centralized lending products. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs USD-Pegged Stablecoin and $50K Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance‚Äôs forthcoming overcollateralized Ethereum-based USD-pegged stablecoin seeks to maintain price stability while avoiding defects in algorithmic stablecoins. The project is already audited by CertiK and is paving the way for massive adoption, and investors who heed the call now stand to benefit the most in the future. To top it all off, the platform is running an incredible $100,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners getting $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. To further strengthen its commitment to security, Mutuum Finance has launched its official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK, with 50,000 USDT allocated for rewards. The program includes four severity tiers, critical, major, minor, and low, ensuring that every level of vulnerability is acknowledged and incentivized. While PEPE‚Äôs momentum cools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, priced at $0.03, the project has already raised over $11.3 million and brought in 12,600+ investors. Early buyers are positioned for a 100% ROI at launch, with projections pointing to a possible 20x surge fueled by its dual lending model, a fully collateralized stablecoin, CertiK-audited security, and a live $100K giveaway. The presale is 45% sold out, secure your allocation before the next price hike.

46991081,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72911,1751162414,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected Timeline for XRP to Hit $200 to $400 Price Range,https://timestabloid.com/projected-timeline-for-xrp-to-hit-200-to-400-price-range/,"XRP has long been at the center of bold price forecasts , with some projections now pointing toward a possible rise into the $200 to $400 range in the future. Although these predictions remain speculative, they have sparked discussion across the crypto industry, especially among analysts and AI forecasting platforms. A move to these levels would represent an increase of nearly 10,000% to 20,000% from XRP‚Äôs current price levels. To evaluate the credibility and timelines behind these targets, projections from several sources, including AI models developed by OpenAI, Google, and xAI, were examined, alongside inputs from market research platforms such as Changelly and Telegaon. Forecasts from AI Platforms: ChatGPT and Gemini ChatGPT by OpenAI provided a data-driven projection based on potential long-term growth rates. The model estimates that XRP could reach $200 within approximately 7.3 years if it achieves a 100% annual compound growth rate. At a faster rate of 150% per year, the milestone could be achieved in roughly 5.2 years. For a $400 price target, ChatGPT projects a timeline of around 8.9 years at 100% annual growth or 6.3 years at 150%. The analysis assumes significant progress in regulatory frameworks, broader institutional participation, and increased adoption of payment-related applications. It also factors in future developments such as integration with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and expansion into financial derivatives. Based on this framework, ChatGPT anticipates XRP potentially reaching $200 between 2029 and 2031, with a $400 target projected between 2032 and 2035, depending on how rapidly adoption and market infrastructure evolve. In contrast, Gemini, developed by Google, offered a more optimistic outlook. Its model indicates that XRP could achieve a $200 valuation as early as 2026 or possibly by 2028, provided that key enablers are met. These include the establishment of clear regulatory standards, the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for XRP, and extensive integration within banking networks for cross-border settlements. Gemini places the $400 projection slightly further out, estimating a realistic timeline between 2028 and 2030. However, it emphasizes that achieving this target would require XRP to become a globally recognized asset for clearing and settlement, particularly within the digital currency infrastructure of central banks. Grok, Changelly, and Telegaon Predictions Grok AI, a product of xAI, acknowledged that achieving $200 to $400 would involve unprecedented price appreciation. The model noted that XRP would need to rise by approximately 9,850% to reach $200 and by nearly 19,800% to hit $400. Grok attributed the possibility of such growth to large-scale institutional adoption and increased usage in international payment flows. The model pointed to XRP‚Äôs past performance, particularly its rise from $0.02 to nearly $4 between 2017 and 2018, as an example of the asset‚Äôs explosive potential. However, Grok cautioned that repeating such growth is unlikely due to XRP‚Äôs much higher market capitalization today. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 It forecasted that XRP could reach $200 sometime between 2030 and 2032 if it secures a strong position in the global remittance sector. Achieving $400, on the other hand, may take until 2035‚Äì2040 and would likely require XRP to compete directly with legacy financial systems such as SWIFT . Changelly, a cryptocurrency exchange and research platform, expects XRP to reach the $200‚Äì$400 range by 2040. According to its projections , XRP could attain a high of $222 in January 2040, followed by a low of $408 just two months later, suggesting substantial volatility during that period. Telegaon , another crypto prediction platform, maintains a more conservative outlook. It does not anticipate XRP reaching $200 until at least 2050. Telegaon projects a minimum price of $236 and a maximum of $285 by that year, but does not currently expect XRP to reach $400 within that time frame. While projections placing XRP between $200 and $400 are far from guaranteed, they reflect optimistic scenarios rooted in technological adoption, institutional interest, and market evolution. Most forecasts agree that reaching such levels would require years of consistent growth and widespread real-world use. However, timelines vary significantly, with the most aggressive estimates pointing to 2026‚Äì2028 and more cautious models extending projections to as far as 2050.

As highlighted by Crypto Man MAB, a double bottom pattern is taking shape on the weekly chart ‚Äî a structure often associated with strong trend reversals. Structure Aligns With Sentiment: Is Dogecoin Poised For A Comeback? According to Crypto Man MAB in a recent post on X, Dogecoin appears to be setting the stage for a potential upward move, with a classic double-bottom pattern taking shape on the weekly chart. This pattern, often seen as a signal of a bullish reversal, has caught the attention of traders who are closely watching for confirmation. The current chart structure suggests that Dogecoin could be gearing up for a significant trend shift, provided the conditions align in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Spot Dogecoin ETF Gains SEC Traction‚ÄîIs A Price Surge Next? At the center of this formation is the key support level at $0.142, which Crypto Man MAB emphasized as being critical to the potential breakout. This level was previously tested and held by bulls back in April 2025, demonstrating its strength as a defensive zone. If the support holds and bullish momentum continues to build, Crypto Man MAB pointed out that the next major focus will be on the neckline resistance around $0.26. A successful breakout above this point could validate the double-bottom pattern and open the door for a rally toward the $0.47 target. Downtrend Fatigue Sets In‚ÄîWill The Bulls Take Over? Crypto Man MAB further noted that the ADX indicator, which is currently trending downward, signals a weakening of the recent downtrend from the neckline resistance. A slowdown in trend strength often precedes a shift in direction, and in this case, it supports the idea that Dogecoin could be preparing for a reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sets The Stage For A Liftoff With Key Reversal Pattern At the same time, attention has turned to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is hovering just below the neutral 50 level. While there are signs of increased buying interest, the RSI has yet to cross into bullish territory. Crypto Man MAB indicated that a decisive move above the 50 mark would significantly reinforce the bullish scenario, increasing the likelihood of a sustained rally. Until then, some sideways consolidation around the $0.142 support level remains possible. In conclusion, Crypto Man MAB believes Dogecoin is at a critical juncture, buoyed by market optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF. With both retail traders and larger investors (whales) accumulating at these levels, the stage is set for a possible breakout. Should current technical conditions improve and sentiment remain favorable, the path toward the $0.47 target could soon come into focus.

With crypto markets heating up, community members are keeping a close watch on tokens that offer more than short-term hype. The search has shifted toward purpose-driven platforms that prioritize utility, scalability, and real-world relevance. Amid this shift, three tokens are commanding attention for their innovation, performance metrics, and ecosystem impact. While the market continues to churn out speculative projects, those with authentic value propositions are setting the tone for the next big cycle. Among these, Qubetics , Injective, and Near Protocol emerge as top cryptos to watch, each offering something distinct for early adopters ready to position themselves for meaningful returns. Qubetics has raised the bar by introducing a tokenized real-world asset marketplace, while Injective is redefining decentralized finance infrastructure with its advanced modular architecture. Meanwhile, Near Protocol is ramping up interoperability features and scaling mechanisms that position it as a key player in Web3. As adoption continues to expand across institutional and retail communities alike, these three projects are being evaluated not just for their market performance, but for their transformative utility. For participants exploring the top cryptos to watch, this trio deserves a serious look based on their current fundamentals and future upside. Qubetics Builds Real-World Asset Tokenization Engine That‚Äôs Reshaping Blockchain Utility Qubetics ranks among the top cryptos to watch for its utility-first approach and advanced Web3 aggregation model. As the first platform to unify major blockchains within a single interoperable system, Qubetics enables seamless tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, equity, intellectual property, and commodities. This framework provides fractional access to investment opportunities that were once limited to institutional channels. From property developers to IP firms, global participants can tokenize, purchase, and trade digital shares without relying on traditional finance. The platform includes a liquid secondary market that ensures transparency and easier portfolio management across asset types. Its interface supports both blockchain-native users and conventional asset holders. With KYC compliance, decentralized governance, and working real-world deployment, Qubetics delivers functional infrastructure that positions it among the top cryptos to watch for long-term value. Final Phase Opportunity: Qubetics Presale Signals One of the top cryptos to watch and Best Entry Points in Crypto Qubetics is currently in its 37th and final presale phase, offering the $TICS token at a fixed price of $0.3370. With more than $18.1 million raised, over 516 million tokens sold, and a rapidly growing base of 28,300+ holders, the project is approaching its listing stage with powerful momentum. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price before Qubetics hits exchanges with a 20% price jump to $0.40. Among the top cryptos to watch, Qubetics stands out due to its real-world application, scarcity mechanics, and final-phase exclusivity. The current stage of the Qubetics presale represents a time-sensitive entry point for those seeking immediate and long-term growth potential. What makes the Qubetics presale one of the best crypto presale opportunities this cycle is its refined tokenomics and commitment to decentralization. By increasing the public allocation to 38.55%, the platform puts more control into the hands of early adopters, prioritizing community governance over centralized influence. This approach has positioned Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to watch, especially as demand intensifies ahead of listing. Analysts anticipate a strong price performance driven by limited supply, Web3 aggregation, and consistent real-world integration, making $TICS a clear contender in any 2025 portfolio focused on long-term blockchain utility. Consider a $5,000 investment at the current Qubetics presale price of $0.3370. That amount secures approximately 14,840 $TICS tokens. With a listing price of $0.40, the immediate value rises to $5,936, reflecting a 20% return out of the gate. But projections for a price range of $5‚Äì$10 per token open the door to substantial upside. If $TICS reaches $5, that $5,000 becomes $74,200. At $10, the same holding climbs to $148,400. The entry point is fixed, the final phase is closing soon, cementing Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to watch . Qubetics to Launch $TICS at $0.40 Following Top Exchange Listing Announcement Qubetics has announced that its native token $TICS will be listed on a Top 10 centralized exchange with a 20 percent price increase upon launch. This step marks a major milestone in the project‚Äôs strategic rollout. The final phase of the public sale is currently active and will close on 30th June at 8 AM UTC. The listing is scheduled for 30th June at 11 AM UTC, with the token priced at $0.40.

With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round now underway, Lightchain AI is steadily drawing attention from serious investors and developers looking for the next evolution in blockchain. The platform‚Äôs AI-native infrastructure includes a purpose-built virtual machine and a consensus model that rewards actual computational work, not idle staking. As its July 2025 mainnet launch nears, Lightchain AI isn‚Äôt chasing headlines‚Äîit‚Äôs earning quiet conviction. While Ethereum codes smart logic, Lightchain AI is earning trust one step at a time. Ethereum Continues Leading in Smart Contract Infrastructure In 2025, Ethereum is still the smart contract behemoth and the‚ÄÇprimary dapp platform. Recent upgrades, such as the Pectra update, have improved transaction speed and lowered costs, further solidifying Ethereum‚Äôs‚ÄÇposition. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the standard for smart‚ÄÇcontract execution and has been implemented for the most blockchains out there (Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, VeChain, etc.). Its strength in developer‚ÄÇadoption and surrounding tooling aids its continued dominance. Scalability notwithstanding an increasing competition in new blockchains Ethereum‚Äôs focus on scaling, security, and decentralization‚ÄÇprovides a secure foundation for it to make a name for itself in whatever form the new blockchain world takes. Lightchain AI Gains Quiet Strength Through Consistent Buyer Activity Lightchain AI is gaining quiet strength through consistent buyer activity, signaling growing confidence in its long-term value. With the Bonus Round priced at $0.007 and over $20.9 million already raised, the project continues to attract steady accumulation rather than hype-driven surges. Buyers are responding to Lightchain AI‚Äôs real infrastructure‚Äîdecentralized validator and contributor nodes, gas-optimized AI execution, and dynamic task-based pricing. The complete reallocation of the original 5% team tokens toward ecosystem growth and a $150,000 grant fund for dApps, tooling, and integrations reinforce its builder-first model. Anticipation is also growing around the upcoming public GitHub release, which will provide transparency and open collaboration for developers. Lightchain AI‚Äôs momentum may be quiet‚Äîbut it‚Äôs deeply rooted in sustained, conviction-based interest. Unlock Big Opportunities with Lightchain AI Don‚Äôt miss out on big opportunities‚Äî Lightchain AI is in its Bonus Round! Get in early with fixed token pricing before the mainnet launch. Built on cutting-edge AI infrastructure, with reallocated grants for builders and decentralized validator nodes, this isn‚Äôt just a presale‚Äîit‚Äôs the start of something game-changing. With cross-chain capabilities and real-world utility in AI computation, Lightchain AI is paving the way for long-term growth.

Both are working through resistance zones, but BlockDAG(BDAG) is offering something different. BlockDAG‚Äôs 100M BDAG airdrop rewards users for taking action, including testnet tasks, social quests, and referrals. Unlike passive investments, it encourages active participation. With a presale price of $0.0080, and a $0.05 listing target, it offers up to 25x ROI potential. This article discusses the technical setups of Polygon and Tron and why BlockDAG‚Äôs airdrop strategy is gaining attention as a top crypto contender. Polygon Holding at $0.18, Waiting for a Breakout Polygon (POL) is currently showing signs of stability after dipping to $0.1732 on June 23. Since then, it has managed to bounce back to $0.18, where it‚Äôs consolidating within a tight range. This technical setup suggests the potential for a bullish breakout if the token manages to hold above $0.18. However, the current range is still holding steady, and traders are watching closely for the next move. If the price continues to hold above the $0.18 mark, it could trigger a larger upward move, but if it fails to maintain this support, it might continue consolidating. The recent stability in the price of Polygon reflects healthy market activity but hasn‚Äôt yet shown signs of explosive growth. Tron Holding Firm at $0.27 with Bullish Chart Patterns Tron (TRX) has shown impressive resilience over the past few days. After dipping to $0.2635 on June 23, it bounced back to around $0.2729 and has held strong near the $0.27 level. The technicals suggest a bullish cup-and-handle pattern, a formation that typically signals a potential breakout. The current support zone between $0.26 and $0.27 is holding, and analysts are optimistic about a possible move toward $0.30 if the trend continues. Tron‚Äôs network data shows increasing whale activity and rising USDT supply, which could help propel the price upward. As July approaches, the market sentiment around Tron remains strong, supported by both technicals and fundamentals. BlockDAG‚Äôs 100M Airdrop: Earn by Doing More, Not Just Holding BlockDAG‚Äôs airdrop is far from your typical giveaway; it‚Äôs an interactive challenge where every user action counts. The 100 million crypto airdrop is divided into four key areas: testnet tasks, presale engagement, social media content creation, and referrals. This diverse approach means there‚Äôs something for everyone to earn. Participants who excel across these areas can land top spots on the leaderboard and win massive rewards, with the #1 winner earning up to 10.1 million BDAG. What makes this system even more attractive is its season-based format. The leaderboard resets every three months, allowing new participants to have a fresh shot at top rewards. Each season offers users the chance to advance based on their consistent efforts, not just early holdings. BlockDAG is now in Batch 29 at $0.0080. So far, it has sold over 23.3 billion BDAG and raised nearly $325 million. With a target listing price of $0.05, early participants could see a 25x return on their holdings. The project has also secured future listings on major exchanges such as MEXC, BitMart, and CoinStore, ensuring liquidity for the upcoming launch. The presale momentum and the innovative airdrop campaign make BlockDAG a top crypto project for those looking to earn through active participation rather than just price speculation. Conclusion While both Polygon (POL) and Tron (TRX) are showing signs of recovery, they are still in consolidation phases, waiting for clear breakout signals. In contrast, BlockDAG is rewarding users with a unique, action-based airdrop system that keeps participants actively engaged. With a $0.0080 presale price, and strong return potential, BlockDAG‚Äôs airdrop system is helping it stand out as a top crypto project in 2025. If you‚Äôre looking for a project that rewards effort and offers real potential, BlockDAG is the one to watch.

In a recent post on the social media platform X, CZ clarified that Binance never delisted XRP despite intense regulatory scrutiny and widespread caution across the crypto industry. ‚ÄúWe never delisted XRP,‚Äù CZ said, responding to renewed public interest after Ripple‚Äôs latest legal developments. His remarks follow news that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the firm is ending its cross-appeal against the SEC, another sign that it is seeking closure to its multi-year-long legal battle. The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, claiming that the sale of XRP by the company was an unregistered securities offering. In its wake, many of the most popular US-based crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, Bittrex, Kraken (for US customers), Bitstamp, and eToro, promptly halted or delisted trading in XRP to get ahead of any regulatory clampdown. It was trivial for any DEX that had previously listed the token to continue to do so, with one exception: Uniswap‚Äôs DEX, Uniswap V2, the world‚Äôs most popular exchange at the time, delisted the token in early 2021. However, Binance, the exchange‚Äôs global arm, still listed XRP during the litigation. Because Binance did not fall under US regulators‚Äô purview, it came under less pressure to follow the SEC‚Äôs guidance. This difference permitted users worldwide to trade XRP even as the case unfolded in American courts. XRP boosted Binance volumes despite legal pressure CZ‚Äôs decision to keep XRP listed on Binance‚Äîand the rationale behind supporting it‚Äîwent beyond geographic considerations. XRP was one of the primary traded coins on Binance, giving them a large trading volume and fee revenue. According to one Binance analyst, XRP was still a highly sought-after asset, and the decision to delist XRP would have adversely affected both its traders and the exchange. However, Mr Powell said there was no reason to eliminate it. An industry observer said that by ensuring customers can buy, sell, and hold XRP, Binance had affirmed its position as ‚Äúno. 1 global XRP spot trading destination‚Äù despite bureaucrats in the US not determining whether the token is a security. The observer noted that it was a calculated risk that ended up giving Binance a competitive advantage, especially after Ripple‚Äôs partial legal victory in July 2023. That ruling, issued by US District Judge Analisa Torres, found that programmatic sales of XRP via public exchanges did not constitute securities sales, a victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Since that ruling, some exchanges have tentatively relisted XRP. Ripple sees institutional adoption after tech upgrades Legal controversies have not stopped Ripple from growing its ecosystem and interest from top institutions. In reality, XRP Ledger (XRPL), the underlying blockchain of XRP, has been quietly and slowly growing for years. Top digital asset companies such as Ondo Finance and Guggenheim have indicated they would be interested in issuing tokenized real-world assets on XRPL. These initiatives happen when blockchain technology faces a serious facelift regarding scalability, interoperability, and compliance requirements. Ripple has also announced its brand of stablecoin efforts. Its new dollar-backed stablecoin (1:1), RLUSD, has had over 12 million minted, indicating the company‚Äôs direction towards tangible real-world utility and institutional-grade financial infrastructure.

Built for both sophisticated investors and crypto-native users, UEX‚Äôs latest product aims to reshape how digital assets are stored, grown, and accessed in a regulated U.S. environment. ‚ÄúWe are not just adding another feature‚Äîwe are introducing a new way to think about digital asset utility,‚Äù said a spokesperson for UEX US. ‚ÄúThis is savings reimagined: flexible, secure, yield-generating, and accessible‚Äîwithout the risks of obscure DeFi contracts or the friction of legacy finance.‚Äù Rebuilding Trust in Yield UEX Savings Accounts allow users to earn daily, automated interest payouts without locking their assets. This marks a pivotal departure from rigid DeFi protocols and centralized products that demand strict holding periods or impose opaque risk profiles. Instead, UEX deploys user assets through a proprietary liquidity framework , generating yield via: Institutional-grade loan backing Real-time hedging strategies Internal order book optimization All activities are fully collateralized, risk-managed, and executed transparently within UEX‚Äôs platform infrastructure. Withdrawals remain available at any time , though brief processing windows‚Äîup to 24 hours‚Äîmay apply during peak liquidity management cycles.

Access with Alignment: Eligibility Requirements To ensure the program‚Äôs long-term sustainability and alignment with serious participants, Savings Accounts are available to: Users with a total portfolio value over $100,000 , or Holders of at least 20,000,000 $C4 , the native token powering UEX‚Äôs ecosystem. This structure both rewards committed participants and limits exposure to risk cycles commonly seen in unrestricted yield programs. Regulated, Resilient, and Secure UEX operates under an active MSB registration in the United States and maintains strict compliance protocols including: Multi-level KYC/AML onboarding Real-time fraud detection Segregated custody flows and transaction screening Continuous risk auditing across fiat and crypto infrastructure ‚ÄúEverything we build at UEX begins with compliance, security, and control,‚Äù said the Head of Platform Security. ‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt explain how it works to a regulator or withstand a real stress test, it doesn‚Äôt go live.‚Äù What‚Äôs Next for UEX US With the Savings Accounts now fully deployed, UEX US is shifting its strategic focus toward scaling trading capabilities and infrastructure to support both institutional clients and algorithmic traders. The next phase includes: Advanced Trading Tools and Order Book Cross-market liquidity bridges Customizable dashboards for power users Military-grade withdrawal protection and wallet-level firewalling ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see us double down on scale, speed, and security,‚Äù said [insert executive name], Chief Technology Officer at UEX. ‚ÄúOur long-term vision is to deliver the most complete and resilient trading ecosystem in the U.S. that matches or exceeds the reliability of legacy platforms.‚Äù The company is also preparing for expanded institutional onboarding and deeper fiat integration, positioning itself as a U.S.-compliant alternative to global giants with offshored operations and legal uncertainties.

The report highlights the risk of a ‚Äúdeath spiral‚Äù for firms holding Bitcoin that trade near their net asset value (NAV), potentially leading to widespread market instability. The Role of MNAV in Treasury Company Resilience The success of Bitcoin treasury companies is closely tied to their ability to maintain a market value that exceeds their NAV, referred to as MNAV. According to Breed, the higher this multiple, the greater the firm‚Äôs ability to attract critical debt and equity financing needed for converting fiat capital into Bitcoin. When this premium erodes, the risk of financial instability increases sharply. Breed outlined a seven-stage process that begins with a decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. As Bitcoin value falls, so does the company‚Äôs MNAV, bringing share prices closer to their underlying NAV. This dynamic reduces investor confidence and makes it increasingly difficult to raise additional capital. This lack of access to fresh credit, combined with looming debt maturities, can trigger margin calls. Firms may be forced to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings at inopportune times, further depressing the asset‚Äôs price. This may result in a consolidation wave, with stronger companies absorbing weaker ones, potentially leading to a broader crypto market downturn. ‚ÄúUltimately, only a select few companies will sustain a lasting MNAV premium,‚Äù Breed‚Äôs report stated. ‚ÄúThey will earn it through strong leadership, disciplined execution, savvy marketing, and distinctive strategies that continue to grow Bitcoin-per-share regardless of broader market fluctuations.‚Äù Equity Financing Provides Some Market Protection The report notes that the potential fallout from the ‚Äúdeath spiral‚Äù may be limited, at least in the near term. Breed‚Äôs researchers said most Bitcoin treasury companies are currently funding their operations through equity rather than debt. This reduces the risk of forced Bitcoin sales due to debt pressures, which could otherwise cause more significant market disruptions. However, this balance could shift in the future. If debt financing becomes more attractive or widespread, the sector might face deeper vulnerabilities, increasing the chance of systemic risk. Treasury Bitcoin Holdings Surge in 2025 The corporate Bitcoin treasury trend has grown rapidly, especially since 2020 when Michael Saylor‚Äôs company, Strategy, began acquiring large quantities of Bitcoin as part of its financial strategy. Since then, the idea has caught on across the financial world. In 2025, over 250 entities now hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. These include corporations, pension funds, ETFs, government agencies, and crypto service providers. Breed‚Äôs report warns that only a fraction of these entities are structurally sound enough to withstand extended volatility and maintain a MNAV advantage. The concern is that others, particularly those heavily reliant on market price appreciation and external financing, may not survive prolonged market downturns. As competition intensifies and the market consolidates, only the most disciplined and strategically agile companies will likely remain standing.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-29 03:44:15

According to the recent update , the company has brought on four more AI scientists : Shengjia Zhao, Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, and Hongyu Ren. These researchers have reportedly accepted offers to join Meta‚Äôs AI division, although their specific roles have not been publicly disclosed. This wave of new hires comes just on the heels of the poaching of three additional, prominent researchers from OpenAI‚Äôs office in Zurich. A few days ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov and Xiaohua Zhai were leaving OpenAI to work for Meta. All three have strong expertise in computer vision and deep learning. Media outlets contacted Meta and OpenAI for comment on the matter, but they both declined to comment. Zuckerberg accelerates AI superintelligence plans The hires represent a major push by Zuckerberg to put his company on the map in the race to develop AI systems that reason, learn and make decisions at or beyond the level of human ability. The quest for artificial general intelligence (AGI) is one of Meta‚Äôs most critical long-term missions, according to Zuckerberg, who has called for a concerted, open-source effort to build this technology. Meta‚Äôs approach is in marked contrast to that of OpenAI, which has taken a more closed model. OpenAI has partnered with Microsoft and closely controls how its models, including GPT-4, are used. Still, Meta has been releasing more of its research and models to the open-source community. This has drawn researchers interested in transparency and scientific freedom, a potential reason top talent is moving. The new hires are being brought in to work on Meta‚Äôs next-gen AI models, namely its Llama series and more general AGI projects, which belong to Meta‚Äôs AI research group, FAIR (Facebook AI Research). The group is developing a powerful multimodal system to understand and generate text, images, audio, and video at human-level quality. Top researchers leave OpenAI for Meta The OpenAI departures have questioned how things are working internally at the company. OpenAI remains one of the most important AI labs in the world, having released the revolutionary ChatGPT and DALL-E models . Still, several of its key staff members have defected to competitors in recent months. Meta‚Äôs poaching raid seems to be the most deliberate yet. Industry experts say the race for top AI talent has entered a fierce new phase. With AGI seen as the ultimate prize in tech, companies are pulling out all the stops to attract the brightest minds. They‚Äôre offering huge salaries, top-tier equipment, full support teams, and unlimited access to data and testing tools‚Äîplus the freedom to explore bold, unconventional ideas in the pursuit of building the intelligent machines of tomorrow. With its huge resources and fresh strategic impetus, Meta is suddenly a compelling place to go. Meanwhile, OpenAI has been scrutinized for its structure, especially since a dramatic late 2023 board shake-up that saw CEO Sam Altman briefly ousted and later reinstated . Some insiders say the turmoil may have affected morale and retention, even as the organization persists in rolling out technical achievements. As Meta steadily lures in more researchers from competing labs, the borders in the AI arms race are being redrawn.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in its Phase 5 presale at just $0.03, is building a full-stack decentralized lending protocol designed to deliver exponential growth through system-driven rewards, not price speculation. Unlike BNB, whose value is tied closely to centralized exchange operations, MUTM‚Äôs protocol is designed for self-sustaining expansion‚Äîwith revenue flowing directly back to token holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on a token supply of 4 billion, with more than $11.25 million already raised and over 12,500 holders joining the presale. At the core of its economic model is a buyback system: a portion of protocol-generated revenue will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market, with those tokens then distributed to mtToken stakers on designated smart contracts. This mechanism creates an engine of recurring value generation, where staking becomes a continuous stream of passive income, not a one-time bet on market action. A $3,000 investment at the current price of $0.03 would yield 100,000 MUTM tokens. Once the token achieves a realistic 30√ó return‚Äîbacked by platform utility and token demand‚Äîthat position would be worth $90,000. This multiplier isn‚Äôt dependent on hype cycles but rooted in the protocol‚Äôs lending functions and smart revenue design. DeFi growth through structure, not speculation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces two lending systems: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). P2C lending allows users to deposit ETH, USDT, or other supported assets into shared liquidity pools. As borrowers draw from these pools with overcollateralized positions, interest rates adjust automatically based on usage. Depositors receive mtTokens in return‚Äîtokenized receipts that track principal and interest growth. These mtTokens are designed to be transferable, tradeable, and usable across DeFi environments. Users will be able to mint mtETH, mtUSDT, or even mtBNB as earning vehicles, all while holding exposure to their underlying assets. Additional yield will flow to those who stake these mtTokens within Mutuum‚Äôs designated contracts, where they will receive buyback rewards in MUTM‚Äîcreating a layered income stream. The protocol will also introduce its own overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged at $1 and only mintable through debt positions backed by locked crypto assets. Liquidations or repayments will burn the stablecoin supply, maintaining equilibrium without relying on external reserves. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more structurally sound in high-volatility environments‚Äîan essential advantage in contrast to exchange-linked assets like BNB, which can react sharply to regulatory or market shifts. To support performance at scale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates Layer-2 technology. This enables fast, low-cost transactions across lending, staking, and trading operations‚Äîremoving the bottlenecks typical of mainnet Ethereum. The Layer-2 foundation also ensures that as user activity rises, performance remains smooh and accessible. Importantly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fully audited by CertiK, with a Skynet Score of 76.50 and a Token Scan Score of 95.00‚Äîplacing it in the upper tier of secure DeFi protocols currently in development. These credentials help establish the protocol‚Äôs trust profile as it approaches the public beta launch. Beta rollout to signal value shift before exchange listing The beta version of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is scheduled to debut just besides the token‚Äôs official listing. This will allow users to begin interacting with the lending platform‚Äîstaking, minting stablecoins, and earning passive income‚Äîbefore the token enters broader markets. It also marks the beginning of real-time user-driven demand, with mtToken activity, pool utilization, and borrowing flows directly fueling the token economy. This transition from presale to live platform is expected to catalyze the first major wave of growth. Users entering now at $0.03 are not only buying a discounted token‚Äîthey are buying into the start of an income-generating platform that‚Äôs structured to scale. At listing, the token price is expected to rise to $0.06, doubling the entry value overnight, before additional growth driven by system demand pushes valuation higher. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers what the next wave of DeFi needs‚Äîstructured earning, secure foundations, and token demand tied to actual usage. While BNB continues its climb toward $1,292, MUTM offers a more asymmetric play. A well-timed position now, backed by smart contracts and yield mechanisms, is designed to generate returns not from speculation‚Äîbut from function. The window to enter at $0.03 is narrowing. As the beta launch approaches and the protocol goes live, the first wave of value will begin flowing directly to early investors. While others wait for BNB to push higher, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is laying out the blueprint for a 50√ó surge‚Äîstarting now.

Musk referred to the bill as ‚Äúutterly insane and destructive.‚Äù In an X post , Musk alleged that the newest Senate draft bill would wipe out millions of jobs in the US and seriously hurt the nation. He further stated that the bill benefits outdated industries while greatly harming future industries. The tech billionaire‚Äôs recent criticism threatens to reignite his public conflict with Trump, which began after the world‚Äôs richest man exited his cost-slashing job in the administration. Musk strongly condemns Trump‚Äôs tax and spending bill The new bill significantly reduces financial support for clean energy initiatives such as wind, solar, and electric vehicle tax credits, while introducing new incentives for the coal industry . Musk has previously stepped in to halt the major spending bill. He opposed a government spending plan by posting about it online last December, which led many Republicans to withdraw their support and almost caused a government shutdown. Back then, Musk had more power as a close ally of Trump and the biggest donor for Trump‚Äôs reelection campaign. However, his influence in the Republican Party has decreased after his controversial time leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which created ongoing problems for the White House. Additionally, in the tech entrepreneur‚Äôs contribution in the congressional debate over President Donald Trump‚Äôs sweeping tax and spending bill, he called the bill ‚Äúa disgusting abomination‚Äù that would cause a surge in the federal deficit. Several US Senate fiscally conservative Republicans supported Musk‚Äôs social media posts, which might make it harder for the bill to pass in that chamber. Musk shared an X post stating that he was really fed up with this. Based on his argument, this huge, ridiculous spending bill from Congress was awful. He continued, ‚ÄúShame on those who supported it: deep down, you know it was wrong. You know it.‚Äù Though the previous proposal would have phased out the incentive at the end of this year for most sales of electric vehicles, the new version ends the credit after September 30. The tax credits for purchasing used and commercial electric vehicles would also expire simultaneously. Musk threatened to finance primary challenges to the GOP‚Äôs tax bill supporters Following Elon Musk‚Äôs fallout with President Donald Trump, the spotlight in Washington shifted to how the rift might impact the GOP‚Äôs tax bill and the billionaire‚Äôs evolving political agenda. Trump and his team stated that the president has shifted his focus to more important issues. The argument with his once omnipresent benefactor had kept both Washington and Wall Street closely watching every update. Trump directed his anger toward Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell after the May jobs report came in better than expected. On Truth Social, he wrote, ‚ÄúGo for a full point, Rocket Fuel!‚Äù He also stated that his main trade advisors would meet with their Chinese counterparts in London. He mentioned that the meeting should go very well. Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans were taking Trump‚Äôs side on the bill, gambling that sticking to the president is a smarter move even as Musk threatens to help finance primary challenges to anyone who votes for it. However, it is worth noting that they were nowhere near agreement on the specifics. Two White House officials familiar with the situation revealed that Trump had no plans or intentions to speak with Musk, though they indicated the tech mogul had hoped for such a call.

Liquidations soared in the first few days of the year, while the market cap of all coins fell to $3.29 trillion. Here are the top catalysts for Bitcoin and altcoins this week. US nonfarm payrolls data The first main catalyst for Bitcoin and altcoins will be the US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) data, which will come out on Friday. Economists expect these numbers to show that NFPs fell from 139,000 to 129,000 in June as companies remained concerned about Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.2%, while wage growth continued ts upward momentum. Strong jobs numbers will signal that companies are continuing hiring despite the burden presented by Trump‚Äôs tariffs. If the jobs numbers miss expectations, they will put more pressure on the Fed to slash interest rates during the month. ADP will publish its estimate of private payrolls data on Wednesday, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the latest job vacancies data. The other top macro events will be the upcoming ISM and S&P Global manufacturing and services PMI numbers. These are important leading indicators that provide more information about the state of the economy. OPEC+ meeting The other potential catalyst for Bitcoin and altcoin prices will be the upcoming OPEC+ meeting this week. This is a closely-watched monthly meeting where members deliberate on oil output or an increase. The cartel has been increasing output over the past few months, and this trend is expected to continue this week. Analysts expect the increase to come in at 411,000 barrels per day in August. The increase is being driven by the cartel‚Äôs goal of gaining market share in the oil market. It is also happening as some cartel members boost their overproduction. Iran is expected to boost more production after the recent war ended. OPEC+ meeting impacts Bitcoin and altcoin prices because of its impact on crude oil prices. Higher oil prices lead to inflation, which may push the Fed to maintain high interest rates for longer. Lower oil prices often contribute to low inflation, which may catalyze interest rate cuts, boosting crypto prices. Brent and WTI prices have dropped in the past few days as the crisis in the Middle East ended. The tariff deadline is nearing The next catalyst for Bitcoin and altcoin prices will be the upcoming July 7 tariff deadline by the United States. With the deadline nearing, traders will watch out on whether Trump will reach deals with some key markets like Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. A tariff deal, such as the one the US reached with China, will be bullish for the crypto market because it will trigger a risk-on sentiment among market participants. Trump has already reached a deal with China and the UK, and more countries are expected to sign agreements. Top token unlocks this week Some crypto prices will be impacted by token unlocks this week. A token unlock occurs when new tokens are released to the market according to the vesting schedule. A token unlock often leads to higher supply in the crypto market, which may lead to lower prices. Some of the top token unlocks scheduled for this week are Origin Protocol, Maverick Protocol, Adventure Gold, Gravity, NAVI Protocol, and Alchemy Pay. Further crypto prices may react to the start of July, which is historically a bullish one for them. The average monthly return in July on Bitcoin is 7%, higher than June‚Äôs minus 2%. Finally, traders will focus on the surging Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows.

The Woman Who Controlled XRP Legal Fate,https://timestabloid.com/who-is-judge-analisa-torres-the-woman-who-controlled-xrp-legal-fate/,"When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, it landed in the courtroom of Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York (SDNY). This is a court that handles Wall Street crimes, elite financial disputes, and political cases. Crypto commentator Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) argues this wasn‚Äôt random. According to his analysis, Judge Torres‚Äô background, connections, and rulings reveal a deeper strategy behind the XRP lawsuit. An Elite Legal Lineage and Suspicious Timing According to Stellar Rippler, Judge Torres is part of a powerful legal dynasty. She graduated from Harvard and Columbia Law, with a family legacy rooted deeply in New York‚Äôs judiciary. Her father, Frank Torres, was a New York Supreme Court Justice, and her grandfather served as a Bronx judge. Stellar Rippler reveals this is a third-generation legal insider with networks spanning decades. In 2013, President Obama appointed Torres to the SDNY. Notably, this was the same year Ripple was incorporated. Stellar Rippler suggests this timing isn‚Äôt accidental. The XRP Ledger quietly began onboarding banks, raising the possibility that the legal infrastructure needed to manage Ripple‚Äôs future challenges was being prepared early. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Career Tailored for Financial Control Torres‚Äôs r√©sum√© includes extensive experience in financial fraud, institutional litigation, and real estate law. He believes Torres‚Äôs time in the NYC Criminal Court and the New York Supreme Court prepared her for cases with heavy financial and public implications. In July 2023, Judge Torres ruled that XRP sold to retail investors is not a security , but XRP sold to institutions is. Following this, she handed down her final ruling in August 2024 , lowering the SEC‚Äôs $2 billion demand to $125 million. This allowed retail hype to surge while institutional clarity remained restricted. More importantly, Stellar Rippler noted that the case remained open, and both parties filed appeals shortly after. Delays Despite Agreement In 2025, Ripple and the SEC jointly requested to dismiss their appeals , but Torres denied two joint motions aimed at kick-starting the settlement process. Stellar Rippler argues that this was deliberate, maintaining public uncertainty while the institutional ecosystem quietly builds. Attached to this post is a video of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speaking about tokenization, which reinforces¬†the claim that XRP is tied to broader financial infrastructure. Stellar Rippler also noted that Torres‚Äôs Columbia Law background connects her to a pipeline feeding SDNY. Her mentor, Judge Richard Holwell, worked alongside BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and WEF-linked figures. Stellar Rippler‚Äôs analysis suggests that Judge Torres isn‚Äôt just ruling on the law, but controlling when the financial system publicly adopts blockchain technology and whether XRP leads that transformation.

46999879,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=757155,1751173210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46999879.jpeg,Trump‚Äôs return has destabilized global economic policy discussions at a key ECB summit,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trumps-chaos-center-stage-central-bankers/,"Five months into Trump‚Äôs second presidency, the economic fallout has become impossible to dodge, and on Tuesday, it officially hijacked the agenda of the world‚Äôs top monetary officials. At the European Central Bank‚Äôs annual retreat in Sintra, Portugal, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, ECB President Christine Lagarde, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, and Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong sat side by side for a public panel that, according to Bloomberg , wasn‚Äôt about strategy anymore, it was about surviving Trump. With tariffs flying, inflation rising, and global trade thrown into a blender, all five officials are now stuck juggling growth risks and inflation threats directly linked to White House policy. Christine and Powell haven‚Äôt been on a panel together since the same ECB event in 2024. That session ended up sounding more like a therapy group for central bankers stuck in political chaos. One year later, it‚Äôs no longer about stress; it‚Äôs now about real economic paralysis. Central banks freeze as Powell signals caution Powell said the Federal Reserve will not rush into any decision on interest rates, even as the US economy starts to cool. Consumer spending has slowed, and core inflation keeps rising. That mix has left the Fed stuck in a gray zone, unsure how aggressive it should be. Bloomberg economist Stuart Paul explained, ‚ÄúQuickening core inflation and slowing spending will keep the Fed uneasy, fueling debate about the appropriate number of rate cuts this year.‚Äù The Bank of England earlier this month also paused its rate changes, while Christine‚Äôs ECB, after cutting rates once recently, has signaled no follow-up moves for now. Japan‚Äôs central bank isn‚Äôt expected to touch its benchmark rate before July 31, and South Korea‚Äôs monetary team is keeping a careful approach. All five are effectively frozen, not by market data, but by uncertainty over Trump‚Äôs next move. Philip Lane, chief economist at the ECB, said in a podcast before the summit that the panel would be the week‚Äôs highlight. ‚ÄúYou do need to step back, rather than just talk about ‚Äòwhat are we going to do in July or September?‚Äô to look at the underlying forces,‚Äù Philip said, adding that the panel would likely be ‚Äúa very lively session.‚Äù In Canada, the trade picture is getting worse. Exports to the US keep falling. Monday marks the start of Canada‚Äôs new digital services tax, which applies a 3% charge on US tech companies with Canadian revenue over C$20 million. Trump responded by cutting off trade talks with Canada entirely last Friday. Asia‚Äôs economy gets hammered by tariffs Asian countries are feeling the heat. This week brings a flood of PMI reports across the region, starting with China‚Äôs official gauge on Monday. It‚Äôs expected to show a third straight month of shrinking factory activity. Trade tensions and persistent deflation are slamming production lines. More PMI readings from South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan will follow. In Japan , the central bank‚Äôs Tankan survey on Tuesday is forecast to show large companies plan to increase capital investment by 10% this fiscal year. While sentiment among manufacturers is cooling, non-manufacturers are still holding near 34-year highs. Regional trade reports are also due from Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, while South Korea reports its June numbers. South Korea will also release CPI data, which could open the door for another rate cut. Indonesia will post its June inflation numbers as well. Industrial output figures from India, Japan, and South Korea, plus household spending numbers from Japan, will round out the week. Europe and Latin America brace for impact Inflation reports from Germany and Italy come out Monday, expected to show small increases. The broader euro-zone inflation figure will hit 2%, right on target. Meanwhile, fresh factory data from France, Spain, and Germany is due Friday. Christine‚Äôs ECB will also release its strategy review Monday, inflation expectations Tuesday, and meeting minutes Thursday. After Sintra, Christine and her team will head to Aix-en-Provence for another economic gathering. On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank will release its Q1 foreign-exchange intervention numbers, followed by the country‚Äôs June inflation report, which is forecast to show consumer prices falling again. Turkey will also release its June inflation rate, expected to drop to 35.2% from 35.4%, which could lead to a 300 basis point rate cut. The UK will publish its full Q1 GDP breakdown on Monday, while Andrew joins both the Sintra and Aix events. In Latin America, Argentina will post April activity data Monday, following weaker-than-expected Q1 growth. Chile will publish its May numbers Tuesday, right after primary elections. Chile‚Äôs central bank kept rates steady in June, citing stronger domestic demand but concerns about global shocks. Its minutes are due Thursday. Colombia‚Äôs central bank will release its meeting minutes Thursday, after it held rates on Friday. The Andean nation is dealing with fallout from its government‚Äôs decision to suspend the fiscal rule, a move that has triggered credit downgrades from S&P Global Ratings and Moody‚Äôs Ratings due to rising debt concerns and policy instability.

The vote passed narrowly at 51 to 49, with every Democrat and two Republicans, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, voting no. The hours-long vote dragged late into the night and only crossed the finish line when three Republican holdouts, Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, gave in and voted yes. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who had slammed the bill for days, also flipped to yes after prolonged negotiations. His last-minute reversal gave Republicans a clean 51, making it unnecessary for Vice President JD Vance to break a tie. Trump calls, flips, and threatens as deadline pressure grows Inside the Capitol and the White House, the pressure cooker boiled. Trump, now fully back in the White House, spent Friday and Saturday working the phones. He called Tillis directly on Friday night to try to lock in his vote. Tillis wasn‚Äôt swayed and told reporters later, ‚ÄúI told the president I couldn‚Äôt support this because of the Medicaid language.‚Äù By Saturday morning, Trump had taken the gloves off, going online to publicly call for Tillis to face a primary challenge. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Scott were seen at the White House ahead of the Senate vote, locked in talks with Vance, Lee, Lummis, and John Thune, the Senate Majority Leader. The group came out just after 11 p.m., having struck enough of a deal to push the bill forward. Trump‚Äôs main goal is to sign the bill before July 4, the deadline Republicans gave themselves. Johnson later said, ‚ÄúThe president‚Äôs pretty confident that whatever we pass here in the Senate, he‚Äôll be able to convince people in the House to pass as well.‚Äù Still, that‚Äôs no guarantee. The bill now heads to a final vote in the Senate, expected late Sunday or early Monday. After that, it will return to the House, which barely passed its earlier version last month. Several House Republicans have already raised alarms over the updated Senate version, especially deep Medicaid cuts. Their votes will be critical in a chamber where Johnson can only afford to lose a few Republicans. Democrats drag debate with all-night bill reading On the Democratic side, the opposition strategy is to slow everything down. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer confirmed on Saturday that Democrats will force the entire 940-page bill to be read out loud on the Senate floor. ‚ÄúWe will be here all night if that‚Äôs what it takes to read it,‚Äù Schumer posted on X. The reading, expected to last around 15 hours, is the first step. Then comes 20 hours of official debate, followed by an all-night amendment vote marathon known as vote-a-rama. Democrats aim to peel back the most controversial parts of the ‚Äò big, beautiful bill ‚Äò: changes to energy tax credits, food assistance, and most of all, Medicaid. ‚ÄúSenate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don‚Äôt realize what‚Äôs in it,‚Äù Schumer said on Saturday. ‚ÄúIf Senate Republicans won‚Äôt tell the American people what‚Äôs in this bill, then Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish.‚Äù The bill‚Äôs biggest landmine is Medicaid. A late-night revision Friday included a delay to the new cap on provider taxes, a rule that affects how states fund their Medicaid programs. The new language also increased a rural hospital assistance fund from $15 billion to $25 billion, a change that finally got Josh Hawley of Missouri on board. But others still weren‚Äôt sold. Collins of Maine said she would vote to begin debate but was ‚Äúleaning against‚Äù final passage unless the Medicaid language changed. ‚ÄúIt is the majority leader‚Äôs prerogative to determine which bills to bring to the floor,‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúThat does not mean in any way that I‚Äôm satisfied with the provisions in this bill.‚Äù She plans to offer amendments in the next round. Tillis remained a hard no. ‚ÄúIt would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population.‚Äù Rand Paul, Ron Johnson, and Rick Scott have been slamming the bill over spending for weeks. Paul‚Äôs biggest problem is the $5 trillion debt ceiling hike buried in the bill, something he‚Äôs refused to support from day one. And the list of complaints doesn‚Äôt stop at healthcare. The Senate version of the bill also rewrites clean energy rules to win over House Republicans. That includes phasing out Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which sparked new backlash Saturday. Elon Musk, who once backed Trump, went online to call the bill ‚Äúutter madness‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical suicide for the Republican Party.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-29 05:38:59
47001783,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72922,1751175746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Issues July 10 Warning to XRP Holders: Here‚Äôs What Is Coming for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-issues-july-10-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-what-is-coming-for-xrp/,"In a recent post on X, well-followed crypto analyst Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) issued a direct message to XRP traders, asking them to mark their calendars for July 10, as he expects a massive surge on that day. The post offered no additional context but followed a prior message where he shared a screenshot confirming the date of the next full moon. The image reveals that the Buck Moon will be visible in the evening of July 10, 2025. The progression between the two posts suggests that the timing of the full moon is not coincidental in his analysis of XRP‚Äôs near-term outlook. Why the Buck Moon Matters The Buck Moon, the full moon that occurs every July, has symbolic meaning related to renewal and growth cycles in nature, as it coincides with when male deer (bucks) begin regrowing their antlers. While traditional markets typically dismiss lunar phases as irrelevant to price action, certain communities within crypto continue to reference them as part of cyclical trading models. Captain Redbeard‚Äôs decision to highlight the Buck Moon date implies he subscribes to this line of analysis, or at least considers it relevant in the current XRP environment. The timeline also aligns with projections from other analysts that XRP will soar in July . In lunar-based market models, full moons are sometimes viewed as pivot points that can coincide with price reversals or accelerations. A notable analyst recently predicted that XRP will hit the peak of the current cycle on July 21 , and July 10 could be a pivotal date in that journey. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other Catalysts That Could Aid XRP‚Äôs Rise Another major development fueling excitement in the XRP community is the imminent conclusion of the legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has announced that the company will drop its cross-appeal , and he expects the SEC to do the same. If the SEC drops its appeal before that date, the excitement and influx of new investors could easily send XRP to a new all-time high. Another well-respected analyst recently predicted that XRP‚Äôs performance in June and July will separate true believers from regretters who sold early. While the reference to the Buck Moon adds an unconventional layer to the analysis, many additional bullish factors could help XRP reach new heights by that date.

The US administration also committed to dropping Section 899 from its tax and spending package . Named the ‚Äúrevenge tax‚Äù as a part of section 899, it aimed at countries with tax systems and policies that Washington deemed unfair , stipulating tax hikes. As part of the agreement, the other G7 countries also agreed to support the US position in discussions with the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has been spearheading global talks on corporate taxation, and some of whose proposals the US has opposed. G7 leaders hail US repeal of Section 899 as catalyst for stable tax agreement Removing section 899 of the US tax bill was key to securing the agreement among the G7 nations. They claimed that its elimination was important to provide a more stable negotiation environment. They said, ‚ÄúWe also recognize that the removal of Section 899 is crucial to this overall understanding and to providing a more stable environment for discussions to take place.‚Äù In another statement, the G7 countries acknowledged that the side-by-side system could bring more stability and certainty to the international tax structure. UK businesses have already enjoyed clarity since the US removed Section 899 from Donald Trump‚Äôs tax bill. In the last few weeks, the country‚Äôs businesses shared their concerns over possible tax hikes due to the incorporation of Section 899 in the tax and spending bill. Now, with the provision excluded, they are spared from more taxes. However, the issue of ‚Äúdigital services taxes‚Äù, imposed by some countries on the profits of US tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., is still pending. However, the G7 economies stated that the side-by-side system will include open discussions on taxing the digital economy and upholding national tax sovereignty. The US tax and spending bill passed a key procedural vote on Saturday, though concerns remain Despite changes to the bill with the exclusion of Section 899, the US Senate approved a vital procedural motion to push forward Trump‚Äôs sweeping tax and spending legislation on Saturday. The vote, however, stalled with some Republicans split on the proposed tax cuts, spending reductions, and increased deportation funding. They raised concerns about cutting off funds for Medicaid, food stamps, and other aid programs that help multiple Americans. Nonetheless, the Senate voted 51 to 49, opening up debate on the legislation. Elon Musk, billionaire and Tesla‚Äôs founder, still opposes the bill, criticizing the Senate draft on his social media platform, X, on Saturday. He argued that the bill will cause many Americans to lose jobs and ultimately harm the country. He added , ‚ÄúUtterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.‚Äù Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer on Saturday also claimed that Republicans were seemingly rushing the bill‚Äôs passage before the public realizes what‚Äôs in it. He asserted that his party would ensure the bill was read aloud before the final vote. Republican Senator Rand Paul also raised concerns over the potential increase in the nation‚Äôs debt limit by $5 trillion with the bill‚Äôs passage . Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

After briefly surging from $0.49 on June 22 to $0.64 on June 26, Pi Coin has slipped over 2% and is currently trading around $0.53. This jump came after the platform‚Äôs Pi2Day announcement and a new Generative AI feature integration. While many expected this news to fuel a stronger rally, the excitement quickly faded. So Why Isn‚Äôt Pi Coin‚Äôs Price Rising? Firstly, the broader crypto market remains volatile, with traders hesitant to dive into altcoins unless there‚Äôs clear momentum. Secondly, while AI partnerships sound futuristic, investors want to see how these technologies will offer real, day-to-day benefits for Pi users, and so far, those details remain unclear. The Pi community is large and passionate, but mixed opinions about the AI announcement‚Äôs actual value are creating uncertainty. New Partnerships Could Trigger Price Rally On the brighter side, Pi Network recently partnered with Banxa and Onramper, two global fiat-to-crypto platforms. Banxa now allows users in over 100 countries to buy Pi directly using traditional payment methods like credit cards, bank transfers, and Apple Pay. It also lets users sell Pi for fiat, making it easier to convert digital coins into real-world money. Banxa bought over 30.5 million Pi Coins (worth around $19 million) to boost liquidity for the network. Pi Network has partenered with Onramper and Banxa. Onramper and Banxa are fiat-to-crypto on-ramp services that facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, including Pi Coin, for Pi Network users. Below is an overview of their uses for the Pi Network based on available‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/IORog9HERX ‚Äî Kim H Wong (@Time_and_Trade) June 28, 2025 Onramper, meanwhile, acts as an aggregator, giving users multiple on-ramp options to buy Pi through various providers, including Banxa itself.

As bullish sentiment returns post-June volatility, a new group of digital assets is beginning to dominate the conversation. Gala is building serious momentum through its rapid GameFi development, while Polkadot is tightening up its parachain utility and cross-chain value. Both have made fresh headlines with new partnerships and protocol enhancements. But what‚Äôs causing even more chatter is a lesser-known contender, Qubetics , that‚Äôs preparing for a top-tier exchange listing while continuing its presale climb. Qubetics ($TICS) is no ordinary project. It combines interoperability, decentralization, and real-world applications in ways that Bitcoin and Ethereum never could. Its decentralized VPN and multi-chain infrastructure are tailor-made for a digitally fluid world that‚Äôs demanding more privacy, more speed, and more control. With the project moving toward a public debut at $0.40, the opportunity window may be closing quickly. It‚Äôs no surprise analysts are calling it one of the top cryptos to join for 2025, and early adopters are rushing in before the listing hits. Qubetics‚Äô Decentralized VPN Infrastructure Redefines Secure Web3 Access The cybersecurity arms race in crypto has intensified, and Qubetics‚Äô solution is turning heads. While many blockchains focus solely on transaction throughput or DeFi optimization, Qubetics is carving out a distinct path with its decentralized VPN, a product that addresses growing concerns over surveillance, censorship, and data control in the digital world. It‚Äôs not just a privacy-first service. It‚Äôs a reimagining of how people and businesses engage with Web3 infrastructure. Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. Qubetics isn‚Äôt building a VPN in isolation. It‚Äôs deploying one embedded into a multichain Web3 aggregator. Users aren‚Äôt just masking IP addresses, they‚Äôre moving across networks, accessing dApps, and storing data with sovereignty and scalability. For developers, this means applications that route securely through chains like Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche without needing third-party bridging or clunky workarounds. For remote businesses or DAOs operating across continents, Qubetics offers safe, decentralised tunneling that puts legacy VPNs to shame. The privacy layer works in tandem with the broader Qubetics ecosystem, which already includes the QubeQode IDE and a marketplace for real-world asset tokenization. Whether it‚Äôs a retail trader in Canada looking to bypass geo-locked DEXes or a healthcare firm securing cross-border medical records, this VPN ensures trace-free access, real-time encryption, and zero central points of failure. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs being hailed by analysts as one of the top cryptos to join for 2025, not because of hype, but because the need for true decentralised privacy is accelerating across every sector. Why the Qubetics Presale is Dominating 2025 ROI Conversations As attention sharpens around practical blockchain utilities, the numbers behind Qubetics‚Äô presale have been raising eyebrows. The project has officially entered Stage 37, pricing each $TICS token at $0.3370. Over $18.1 million has been raised, and more than 516 million tokens have already been sold to over 28,300 early community members. These figures aren‚Äôt just about traction, they reflect significant interest in a model built on scarcity, transparency, and value delivery. At current rates, a $5,500 allocation yields approximately 16,324 $TICS tokens. Should Qubetics reach its listing price of $0.40, that figure would climb to $6,529, delivering a modest yet immediate return. But if $TICS rises to $5 in the next bull market, a scenario being floated in analyst circles given its infrastructure and adoption, those same tokens would be worth $81,620. Push that projection to $10 or $15, and the figures land between $163,240 and $244,860 respectively. Only under 9 million tokens remain at the current crypto presale rate. Once these are sold, access to $TICS shifts entirely to the open market. No more discounts. No more stages. Just pure market demand. For those exploring the Qubetics presale, the window to enter before its official listing on a top 10 global exchange is narrowing fast. That listing alone is expected to result in a 20% price jump, making this one of the top cryptos to join for 2025 for ROI-driven buyers eyeing both short- and long-term growth. Listing Timelines and Launch Details: What Buyers Need to Know While Qubetics has avoided announcing a fixed date publicly, insiders confirm the public sale ends June 30th at 8:00 AM UTC, with the official listing scheduled just three hours later at 11:00 AM UTC. The listing price is pegged at $0.40, which gives late-stage participants a narrow yet powerful runway to benefit from the expected 20% bump. Once live, trading will occur on one of the top 10 exchanges in the world, cementing Qubetics‚Äô move from presale hype to market presence. For buyers still evaluating whether to enter, this moment represents more than just a price threshold, it‚Äôs a strategic crossroads. Scarcity is baked into Qubetics‚Äô tokenomics. With a max supply capped at 1.36 billion, and only 38.55% available to the public, post-listing liquidity and supply constraints could drive substantial movement. Gala‚Äôs GameFi Growth Sparks Renewed Excitement Gala is not new to headlines, but 2025 might be the year it becomes a household name in GameFi circles. The platform, which centers around decentralizing game ownership, has made significant leaps this quarter. Gala Games recently rolled out major updates to its GalaChain, offering native integration for games, NFT assets, and cross-platform utility, all backed by real-time data flow. Unlike Web2 gaming studios, Gala is putting control directly in the hands of its users, allowing them to earn and spend within a circular in-game economy. Recent partnerships with gaming studios in Asia and Latin America have expanded Gala‚Äôs footprint, especially in mobile-first gaming communities. Their token model, focused on rewarding participation and in-game value creation, is drawing attention from creators tired of legacy revenue cuts. With GalaChain offering near-zero gas fees, it‚Äôs now being seen as a viable alternative to Polygon and Immutable for emerging titles. That ecosystem appeal is why Gala remains in conversations about top cryptos to join for 2025. With utility baked into its tokens and a passionate global user base, Gala offers a narrative rooted in both decentralization and digital entertainment, a combo proving increasingly compelling to new buyers. Polkadot‚Äôs Multichain Framework Continues to Deliver Polkadot has weathered market swings with a quiet kind of power. While it doesn‚Äôt always capture the spotlight, its technology continues to underpin some of the most efficient and future-proof networks in the crypto space. Its parachain system, which allows multiple blockchains to operate in parallel and interact seamlessly, has expanded this year with new runtime upgrades and slot auctions drawing record bids. Key to its strength is the Substrate development framework. Projects building on Polkadot don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel, they inherit security, interoperability, and scalability from day one. In recent months, Polkadot has seen increased usage in DeFi projects, identity protocols, and even AI-linked blockchain infrastructure. With growing adoption of Web3 ID solutions and state-backed CBDC pilots leveraging interoperable chains, Polkadot is re-emerging as a core layer-0 solution for the next phase of blockchain evolution. That‚Äôs why it holds steady on lists tracking the top cryptos to join for 2025. Its steady progress, coupled with a maturing ecosystem and real-world integrations, make it a strategic hold for those looking beyond hype-driven spikes. Final Word: The Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 Are Already Shaping Up Between Qubetics, Gala, and Polkadot, three distinct narratives are emerging, each tailored to different use cases but all pointing toward real-world functionality. Gala is betting on digital ownership in the gaming space, Polkadot is optimizing multichain connectivity, and Qubetics is securing privacy and performance through a decentralized VPN infrastructure. But it‚Äôs the momentum behind the Qubetics presale that‚Äôs pushing the conversation forward, especially with its listing around the corner. With market conditions stabilizing and capital looking for scalable infrastructure projects, Qubetics stands out as a contender not just for price appreciation but for long-term utility. As analysts reiterate, it may be among the top cryptos to join for 2025 , and certainly the best crypto presale currently on the table. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics one of the top cryptos to join for 2025? Its decentralized VPN application, multichain support, and upcoming top-tier exchange listing position it for strong utility and ROI growth. When will Qubetics get listed? The listing is confirmed for June 30 at 11:00 AM UTC, shortly after the public presale ends. How does Gala differ from traditional gaming platforms? Gala enables players to own in-game assets and benefit from token-based economies without centralized control or heavy platform fees. Summary Qubetics, Gala, and Polkadot are emerging as the top cryptos to join for 2025, each backed by strong utility and real-world momentum. Qubetics leads with its decentralised VPN application and upcoming listing on a top 10 exchange at $0.40, signaling a projected 20% price jump. With over $18.1M raised in its presale and only a few million tokens left at the current $0.3370 price, Qubetics is building rapid traction among early buyers. Gala continues expanding its GameFi ecosystem with new studio partnerships, while Polkadot‚Äôs multichain architecture cements its place in the future of Web3 infrastructure. As the June 30 Qubetics listing approaches, attention is rapidly shifting toward its 100x upside potential and real-world use cases.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre closing this chapter once and for all.‚Äù With the SEC expected to reciprocate, XRP surged by 5% at one point to $2.2. But beneath the modest green candle lies a tidal wave of speculation. The question everyone‚Äôs whispering, tweeting, and meme-posting about: Could XRP really hit $10,000? The $10K Obsession There have been more modest predictions, such as those of social media personality Jake Gagain, who recently calculated that a 50x surge, as touted by Carl Moon, would catapult XRP to $106.50. Influencers like Lucy Bear have called such projections ‚Äúconservative,‚Äù with Casi Trades boldly stating: ‚ÄúIf you think XRP can‚Äôt reach double digits, you don‚Äôt understand crypto!‚Äù What about the $10,000 promised land? If the XRP Army is to be believed, this number isn‚Äôt plucked from some random crypto casino. Apparently, it traces back to elusive Ripple co-founder and XRPL architect Arthur Britto, who is said to have envisioned a future where XRP would serve as the global liquidity backbone for all payments. According to enthusiasts, Britto believed that for XRP to fulfil its destiny, it would need to hit a staggering $10,000 per token. And while many have scoffed at such moonshot valuations, diehards seem to be doubling down. In a recent episode of The Rollup podcast, former NEAR engineer Altan Tutar described the XRP fraternity‚Äôs $10,000 conviction as almost religious, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this in any other community.‚Äù While not directly adding his name to the believers‚Äô list, Tutar acknowledged the rationale behind the conviction, comparing XRP‚Äôs potential rise to Bitcoin‚Äôs own journey to an all-time high price of $111,814. ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin went to $100K, then why not XRP to $10,000?‚Äù he asked. But Here‚Äôs the Reality Check A $10,000 XRP price implies a market cap of $590 trillion, dwarfing the entire global economy. Even Gagain‚Äôs $106 price means a $6.28 trillion valuation, more than double Bitcoin‚Äôs peak market cap. It‚Äôs probably why Rollup host Andy bluntly dismissed $10,000 as pure fantasy, stating, ‚ÄúXRP is not going to $10,000‚Ä¶ $10 is already a stretch.‚Äù The post Ripple‚Äôs Legal Fight Nears End: Is the $10K XRP Dream Possible? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple|SEC|XRP,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-29 06:35:38

Notably, XRP has hovered around the $2 mark for months, with its current price at $2.18. Despite this lack of movement, many analysts remain bullish. They argue that XRP is significantly undervalued and point to its growing use in cross-border payments.¬†Some even suggest that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could eventually play a major role in the global derivatives market, which some estimate to be worth as much as $1 quadrillion. However, how this could impact XRP price remains unclear.To explore what XRP's price could look like if the XRPL captured just 10% of that market, roughly $100 trillion, we asked ChatGPT. The AI chatbot analyzed the scenario based on XRP's total supply of 99 billion tokens and presented several possible outcomes.XRP Price if the XRPL Captures 10% of the Derivatives MarketIn the first approach, ChatGPT used a direct market cap model. It is assumed that XRP absorbs the entire $100 trillion into its market value.¬†Specifically, dividing $100 trillion by the total supply of 99 billion tokens, the projected price per XRP comes out to around $1,010. Direct Market Cap XRP Pricing Model ChatGPT Direct Market Cap XRP Pricing Model | ChatGPT However, the chatbot clarified that this figure extends beyond what's realistic, as it assumes XRP becomes the sole store of value for all transactions, a role that doesn't align with how the XRPL works today.Next, ChatGPT looked at a collateralization model. In this case, XRP wouldn't need to reflect the full $100 trillion in its market cap. Instead, it would serve as collateral for financial products on the XRPL, similar to how Ethereum supports various DeFi platforms.¬†If 1% of the $100 trillion, or $1 trillion, gets locked in XRP, the price would rise to about $10.10. With 5% locked, it would jump to $50.51. If 10%‚Äîor $10 trillion‚Äîends up in XRP as collateral, the price could hit $101.01. Collateralization XRP Pricing Model ChatGPT Collateralization XRP Pricing Model | ChatGPT ChatGPT highlighted this model as a more feasible option, especially if the XRPL expands to support smart contracts and synthetic assets. Ripple is already exploring avenues to introduce smart contracts to the network.The NVT ApproachMeanwhile, the third model used the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio, a tool that compares a crypto asset's market cap to its transaction volume. Assuming the XRPL processes $274 billion daily, which adds up to $100 trillion annually, the chatbot tested average NVT ratios of 30, 50, and 100. NVT XRP Pricing Model ChatGPT NVT XRP Pricing Model ChatGPT Based on those numbers, XRP's market cap would range from $8.22 trillion to $27.4 trillion. That puts XRP's price between $83.03 and $276.77, depending on how efficiently the network supports transactions relative to its value.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-29 06:55:57

Here‚Äôs What Needs to Happen (Analyst),https://cryptopotato.com/30-surge-for-dogecoin-heres-what-needs-to-happen-analyst/,"TL;DR The meme coin mania seems to have faded despite a few brief moments of hope, and the niche‚Äôs leader has failed to recapture its momentum and investors‚Äô attention. However, there‚Äôs a chance for a massive double-digit surge, but only under certain conditions, according to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez. If Dogecoin $DOGE can reclaim $0.17 ‚Äî and with the TD Sequential buy signal now present on the 3-day chart ‚Äî it could unlock a rebound toward $0.21. pic.twitter.com/BkVgxNdihW ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) June 28, 2025 To embark on its 30% journey north, the largest meme coin by market cap first needs to reclaim the $0.17 resistance. This doesn‚Äôt sound like such a major hurdle, given its current price tag of $0.164. The second part of the equation involves the TD Sequential, which is a metric often used to determine the underlying asset‚Äôs market exhaustion in either direction. The indicator has presented a buy signal on DOGE‚Äôs 3-Day chart. Consequently, Martinez concluded that both of these factors could result in a price pump to $0.21. This would be a breath of fresh air for Dogecoin, which has struggled quite a lot since early 2025. In the past month alone, its price has tumbled by over 21%. Despite this rather unfavorable market movement lately, some industry participants have remained highly bullish on DOGE‚Äôs future price trajectory. JAVON MARKS, known for his bullish statements on several crypto assets, believes the OG meme coin still has a chance to post a mind-blowing surge that can take it to the stratosphere, based on historic performance. All we‚Äôre saying is that if $DOGE continues to follow its trend as it did consecutively in the past two cycles with its runs growing in size, then we are looking at Dogecoin‚Äôs prices doing a more than 120X from here into the $20 levels. Take a look‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/OkxGfzUeBp ‚Äî JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) June 26, 2025 Such a price tag sounds just a bit far-fetched at the moment. History is no indication for future price movements, and $20 per DOGE would mean a whopping market cap of roughly $3 trillion, which would make it a lot bigger than BTC.

The cybersecurity firm Zimperium says the malware employs a novel virtualization technique that allows legitimate banking apps and other applications on a victim‚Äôs device to be hijacked. ‚ÄúInstead of simply mimicking a login screen, the malware installs a malicious ‚Äúhost‚Äù application that contains a virtualization framework.

After bouncing from around $2.07 a couple of days ago, XRP is now facing resistance near $2.19 to $2.20, a level it struggled to cross during its last attempt. Current Support and Resistance Zones At the moment, XRP has strong support between $2.07 and $2.10, where buyers have stepped in recently. On the upside, the key resistance remains around $2.19 to $2.20. If the price can manage to break and hold above this range, it could aim for the next targets around $2.24 to $2.25. A bullish move would be if XRP pushes above the $2.30 to $2.35 zone. That would open the door for a rally toward $2.60, possibly retesting previous highs. But for now, the market isn‚Äôt showing strong momentum in either direction. Market Sentiment Still Bearish Or Bullish? Like the rest of the crypto market, XRP is moving cautiously. Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are lacking clear direction at the moment, causing XRP to trade sideways too. An analyst has predicted that XRP could be gearing up for a major breakout in 2025. After months of moving sideways, the price has finally broken above a key resistance level and is now holding steady around $2 to $1.90. Is $XRP the next big breakout of 2025?

If XRP manages to stay above this support zone, it could be one of the altcoins to lead the next big rally in the crypto market. What to Watch Next In the short term, the focus remains on whether XRP can clear $2.20. A clean move above this could invite more buyers and push the price higher. On the flip side, if XRP drops below $2.14, it could test lower support levels again around $2.07.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-29 07:05:32

The FHFA is considering a proposal to factor in cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin when qualifying for a mortgage. Wood described the move as ‚Äúa major step‚Äù toward integrating digital assets with traditional financial systems . She says the proposal could bring financial access to millions of crypto investors who are barred from homeownership because their wealth isn‚Äôt stored in traditional assets. FHFA explores crypto for mortgage approval The FHFA has said that it‚Äôs actively working to figure out how digital assets can have a valid place in mortgage underwriting. Bill Pulte, a housing advocate involved in the ongoing talks , said , ‚ÄúWe will study the usage of cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages.‚Äù It would be a break from traditional mortgage underwriting, which large banks use to vet potential homeowners based primarily on their income stability, proven employment record and credit score. Today, crypto holders looking to purchase homes frequently need to convert their cryptocurrency holdings to cash, generating taxable events and giving up long-term investment positions. The FHFA‚Äôs proposal would enable them to hold on to their Bitcoin while employing it to secure home loans . Top crypto figures push for Bitcoin-backed mortgages Cathie Wood isn‚Äôt the only big-name proponent of the proposal. Bitcoin bull and Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor has contended for some time that Bitcoin should be seen as a serious financial asset rather than a plaything and has not been shy of proclaiming its virtues to anyone who will listen. Getting a traditional loan can be difficult for many crypto investors, particularly pioneer adopters, freelancers and online entrepreneurs because their income is not funneled through traditional paths. They get turned down despite having substantial crypto wealth. The proposed rule change would partially redefine who can be considered ‚Äúcreditworthy.‚Äù Instead of penalizing nontraditional earners, it would establish a framework that mirrors modern wealth building. Authorities add that this direction would incentivize lenders to create and offer mortgage products designed specifically for digital currency owners. It may also create crypto-collateralized mortgages, in which borrowers put up part of their crypto stocks as assets against the loan, all without having to cash out their assets. Digital assets gain ground in the mortgage market If the FHFA‚Äôs proposal is adopted, it could have effects far beyond the mortgage market. If the home loan sector formally embraces cryptocurrency, it would be a formal step towards embracing digital assets as part of the broader financial system. For crypto holders, that could be a brave new world of financial inclusion. Borrowers could use their Bitcoin as investment capital to secure real-world, tangible assets, such as homes, with loans. This would unlock liquidity without taxes on capital gains and without being required to sell your source of income. The move may prompt wider adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among retail and institutional investors. For one, it would give the space the coveted sense of legitimacy if major institutions supported by the government accepted crypto as part of financial qualification processes. Banks could even be persuaded to build infrastructures to deal with crypto-backed loans. People may have some hybrid lending tools in the future, such as fiat- and crypto-based mortgage offerings. If Bitcoin-denominated mortgages become the norm, new types of mortgage-backed securities, including exposure to digital assets, could be introduced. The FHFA is still collecting public input and studying the potential effects, but the response from crypto and financial leaders indicates powerful winds behind the concept.

Ethereum (ETH), the quiet hero of smart contracts, remains a long-term value proposition with its massive ecosystem and institutional adoption, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is coming up as a disruption wild card in DeFi market. Buyers who invest at this moment will see 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. Over $11.2 million has been raised so far, and there are over 12,500 registered investors. By the time the presale reaches Phase 6, the token price will be at $0.035, a 16.67% immediate return on any stage 5 investment. With Q3 looming, cryptocurrency predictions are featuring more and more smaller, utility-focused projects like Mutuum Finance, whose novel approach to decentralized lending may just see it position itself as a force to be reckoned with in the 2025 investing market. Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing as a new generation lending platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. There are also the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the user to agree on terms among themselves. This direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long-Term Built, Audited, and Now Backed by $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry‚Äôs most trusted security firms, has confirmed that the codebase meets high standards for transparency and safety, offering assurance to both investors and users. To further shore up its ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an Ethereum-based fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to USD. In contrast to the algorithmic models, which are susceptible to depegging, the current stablecoin is programmed to launch long-lasting liquidity, stability, and dependability to the retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as an upside-oriented substitute to investors seeking 2025. Ending its presale at Phase 5 with a price of 0.03, Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $11 million, with more than 12,500 investors being already involved. Entrants in this stage will gain 100% ROI upon launching, and 16.67% gain can be taken immediately prior to the phase 6. It is also elevated by a $100,000 giveaway, a $50K bug in collaboration with CertiK and the building of a USD-pegged stablecoin. Ethereum has stability, whereas Mutuum finance has a prospect.

Lido DAO members have largely unanimously approved a two-way governance system that gives stakers (stETH holders) the power to delay or veto governance proposals. The new system brings a balance to the current governance model, where only Lido token holders (LDO) can submit proposals and participate in voting. The aim is to prevent LDO holders from approving a proposal that would negatively impact Lido‚Äôs stakers or the Ethereum ecosystem. According to the new structure, stakers, namely stETH token holders, will be able to register their objections to a governance proposal by depositing their stETH assets into a special ‚Äúescrow contract.‚Äù If 1% of the total staked ETH is deposited into this contract, the relevant proposal will be postponed for 5 days in the first stage. As this rate increases, the postponement period will also be extended. If a 10% threshold is exceeded, the offer will be completely ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù and the protocol will enter ‚ÄúRage-Quit‚Äù mode. In this case, either the dissenting stakers will withdraw all their assets, or Lido DAO will completely cancel the relevant offer. During this period, no new offers will be implemented. Related News: On-Chain Data Is Surprising: Transaction Volume on a Major Altcoin Has Tripled in the Last Three Months The main phase of the vote was completed with 53.6 million LDOs casting a ‚ÄúYes‚Äù vote, just above the quorum of 50 million LDOs. Only a single person cast a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù vote of 1.18 LDOs. These results indicate a similar turnout to previous Lido DAO votes. In the remaining ‚Äúobjection‚Äù phase of the voting process, only LDO holders have the right to vote ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or change their current vote from ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Unless there is a large-scale organized counter-campaign at this stage, the proposal is expected to be finalized on June 30 at 17:00 (GMT+3). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin made a statement supporting two-way governance. Buterin emphasized that this structure creates an independent security layer ‚Äúespecially against malicious actions‚Äù and allows Ethereum stakers to position themselves as true rights holders in the Lido ecosystem. The Lido team described the change as ‚Äúone of the most significant protocol upgrades in the entire Lido ecosystem.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

Reacting to Judge Analisa Torres‚Äô decision regarding the SEC‚Äôs request for an indicative ruling to dissolve the injunction against Ripple, Deaton stated , ‚ÄúAlthough I believed she would ultimately grant the indicative ruling, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm shocked.‚Äù His comment reflects a balance between expectation and acknowledgment of the legal complexities surrounding the case. Judge Torres‚Äô Firm Approach In an attached video, Deaton elaborated on the legal reasoning behind the judge‚Äôs response. He explained that Judge Torres signaled clear dissatisfaction with how the SEC approached its request. According to Deaton, the judge pointed out that the SEC cited the wrong legal rule in its motion. More importantly, the SEC had failed to demonstrate the presence of exceptional circumstances that would justify the court reversing or dissolving its prior injunction. Deaton emphasized that Judge Torres made it clear that the bar for dissolving an injunction is set very high. She reminded the parties that her original decision was grounded in the law and that simply deciding to change course would not be sufficient justification. Deaton noted her firm stance, summarizing her message as requiring the SEC to present substantial justification, not mere convenience. Frustration with the SEC‚Äôs Approach Deaton did not hold back in expressing his view that the judge appeared frustrated by the SEC‚Äôs approach. Referring to Judge Torres‚Äô reaction, he commented, ‚ÄúI thought, shit, she‚Äôs pissed off.‚Äù He pointed out that the judge has dedicated over four and a half years to this case, investing significant time, resources, and judicial effort. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The sudden pivot by the SEC, which initially pursued a $1.3 billion penalty but later asked the court to reduce the $125 million fine by 60% seemed insufficiently justified from her perspective. Deaton suggested that this abrupt change in position likely contributed to the judge‚Äôs demand for a higher standard of explanation. He framed it as an understandable reaction, considering the magnitude and duration of the litigation. Expectations Regarding Legal Filings Deaton further commented on the quality of the briefings presented by both the SEC and Ripple in response to the court‚Äôs requirements. He expressed disappointment, stating that he had expected a more detailed and thorough submission. His remarks suggested that both parties, particularly the SEC, underestimated the burden of proof required to satisfy the court‚Äôs demand for exceptional circumstances. He reiterated that the judge‚Äôs insistence on more substantial evidence and reasoning reflects the serious nature of changing a court order. Deaton‚Äôs analysis indicates that Judge Torres is maintaining strict adherence to legal standards rather than allowing procedural shortcuts.

Starting late June, around 337 million Pi tokens will be unlocked ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just the beginning. With over 1.4 billion tokens expected to hit the market in the coming year, many Pi holders are asking the same question: Can the price survive this much pressure, or is a major drop on the way? 337 Million Pi Tokens to Unlock In July According to the Pi scan , a large number of Pi tokens will be unlocked in June and July 2025, with around 337 million Pi tokens being unlocked ‚Äî roughly 4.1% of Pi‚Äôs circulating supply. Meanwhile, the current total volume of the upcoming 337 million Pi tokens will be around $179 million worth of Pi potentially entering the market. This isn‚Äôt just a routine event. Historically, big unlocks like this have been followed by sharp price drops across many tokens. Some have lost anywhere between 30% to 77% of their value in similar situations. Many in the Pi community are now concerned that this upcoming unlock could result in heavy sell-offs from early holders or project insiders. No Exchange Listing, No Strong Partnerships Adding to the concern is the fact that Pi is still not listed on any major exchanges. That means there‚Äôs limited liquidity, making it harder for the market to absorb large sell volumes. On top of that, there have been no significant enterprise partnerships or inflows of new capital to support demand. Even during Pi2Day ‚Äî one of the most symbolic events for the Pi community ‚Äî the coin failed to see any meaningful price rally. Without major catalysts, the sentiment around Pi seems to be fading. Impact On Pi Coin Prices Meanwhile, token unlocks often impact how traders feel and can quickly move prices, especially for newer and more volatile coins like PI. Meanwhile, in late June & late July, 337 million new PI tokens are hitting the market. If many of these unlocked tokens are sold right away in a market with low trading volume, the price could fall sharply, possibly even back to its previous low of $0.37. As of now, PI has a circulating supply of 7.68 billion tokens and a market cap of about $4.06 billion. Currently, Pi coin is trading near $0.533 . Upcoming Token Unlocks Ahead According to Pi Scan , a large number of Pi tokens will be unlocked in the coming months: Around 33 million in June Nearly 305 million in July Over 132 million in August In total, more than 1.4 billion tokens are expected to be unlocked within the next year.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-29 07:44:01

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends as the coin‚Äôs price is slowly decreasing after a correction observed today. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI‚Äôs price might aim for a dip toward $6.77. On the other hand, a success in finding buying demand might trigger a surge. In such a case, UNI‚Äôs price might jump above immediate resistance channels and head toward the $7.34 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $23.01 level by 2027 and above $45.41 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a corrective phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $7.11, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.90, while the average price is expected to be around $9.08. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.8 and $7.5; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it‚Äôs worth waiting, as the coin‚Äôs value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI‚Äôs price to reach $47.22 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a well-known market analyst, recently published a detailed chart that highlights several critical levels the digital asset must navigate to shift its trajectory. The chart emphasizes a recurring price pattern that has persisted for months. Price action remains compressed within a descending wedge , with XRP repeatedly testing a major support zone that has become a defining battleground for bulls and bears. EGRAG CRYPTO labels this region between $1.9 and $2.1 as a range that the asset must retest, as it has provided stability multiple times. However, he warns that losing the support line at $1.43 could cause a major collapse. #XRP : pic.twitter.com/zEMnNe3XTc ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 28, 2025 XRP Key Breakout Levels Identified While the risks are evident, the analysis also offers a blueprint for bullish continuation. The first key breakout level is at $2.22, a figure EGRAG describes as signaling ‚Äúa potential move higher.‚Äù This level represents the upper boundary of the horizontal resistance zone that EGRAG CRYPTO has previously highlighted and XRP has struggled to reclaim. Price movement above this line would signal the start of a bullish reversal within the context of the larger wedge formation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Beyond the initial breakout at $2.22, the chart points to $2.35 as a critical confirmation level. In the analyst‚Äôs own words, a move above this area would be ‚Äúthe real boost indicating strength and momentum building.‚Äù This zone acts as a filter, separating minor rallies from full-scale bullish trend shifts. XRP Macro Breakout Targets The broader technical picture also highlights $2.65 as a macro breakout level. The analyst has constantly reiterated this target and believes it is ‚Äúthe key zone for long-term strength.‚Äù Reclaiming this level would not only mark a decisive shift in the local trend but also position XRP for extended upside toward much higher targets. Notably, the technical setup shows XRP compressing between downward sloping resistance lines and the horizontal support zone. This structure aligns with traditional wedge patterns, often leading to volatile breakouts once the price escapes the narrowing range. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and the timing projection on the chart points to late July 2025 as a potential inflection point. EGRAG CRYPTO has predicted that XRP will hit its peak price for this cycle on July 21 , and the current setup seems to be building toward this date.

This new cryptocurrency leverages authentic artificial intelligence, setting a new standard in the meme coin sector traditionally dominated by PEPE and SHIB. The Revolutionary AI-driven Trading Platform Codename:Pepe is not just another meme coin; it's a technological advancement in crypto trading. With its powerful AI-driven platform, it scans social media platforms like X and Telegram, decodes on-chain data, and utilizes insider signals to predict and capitalize on the next trending meme coin. The platform‚Äôs core feature is its fully automated AI trader that takes the guesswork out of trading by executing trades based on these advanced analytics. This allows both seasoned traders and novices to enjoy passive income through efficient, automated trading strategies. The Role of $AGNT in Codename:Pepe‚Äôs Ecosystem The backbone of Codename:Pepe‚Äôs functionality is its utility token, $AGNT, which facilitates various benefits for its holders: Access to AI signals and automated trading, Exclusive membership in the DAO, allowing investors to vote on important project decisions, Profit-sharing from staking operations, Opportunities to participate in the AI-Launchpad for new tokens. Investors are currently offered the chance to buy $AGNT at a reduced price, with its value projected to increase significantly by the time it lists publicly. Invest in Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Today Security and Accessibility Codename:Pepe operates on the Ethereum Mainnet, ensuring robust security and accessibility. It has passed rigorous audits by Pessimistic, guaranteeing a secure investment environment free from common crypto pitfalls like rug pulls. Comparative Analysis with PEPE and SHIB Coins While PEPE and SHIB have been dominant players in the meme coin arena, their functionality mainly revolves around community and cultural impact without strong utility-backed foundations. PEPE coin, inspired by the viral meme of Pepe the Frog, focuses on a simple deflationary model. Despite achieving some historic highs, it remains a high-risk investment with speculative long-term value. On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a fun meme but has since expanded its ecosystem to include a decentralized exchange and proposed NFT projects. This evolution brings it closer to having real-world utility but still relies heavily on community support and market trends. Conclusion Codename:Pepe stands out in the crowded meme coin market by integrating real AI technology with cryptocurrency trading. This not only enhances its investment appeal but also positions it as a potentially sustainable asset in the volatile crypto market. For those keen on exploring new cryptocurrencies that offer genuine utility and growth potential, Codename:Pepe presents a compelling choice. With its innovative use of AI and a robust economic model, it has the makings of a meme coin that could indeed see a 7,000% increase by 2026.

The court rejected the request because neither party had demonstrated the ‚Äúexceptional circumstances‚Äù required to alter a final judgment under Rule 60(b). Judge Torres emphasized that even when both parties agreed to settle, the prior finding of a likely ongoing violation of securities laws justified the injunction, and she refused to discard that decision without a compelling reason. This wasn‚Äôt the first time the court had pushed back. A previous joint filing, also aiming to soften the judgment, was rejected . Even after resubmitting the motion with corrections, Ripple and the SEC failed to convince the court that the situation warranted an override of its final ruling. What‚Äôs Next for Ripple and XRP? Ripple‚Äôs next steps involve moving forward under the court‚Äôs terms and refocusing on its core business. Ripple has indicated it‚Äôs ready to leave the legal battle behind and prioritize growth.

But that‚Äôs after rolling up off an all time low price just above $0.50 on Sunday. Will traders circle back to PI this summer? Pi bulls certainly think so. Over the recent 30 day window, Bitcoin traded flat at -0.7% for the month‚Äôs trades. Ethereum fell -2.86%. XRP was down 4.39%. But the top three cryptos by total market cap did okay in June compared to Pi. Pi coin was down by 28% over the 30 day window ending Wednesday, Jun. 25. That‚Äôs after rallying 7% on Wednesday. On the trailing 12-month window, PI is down by over -66%. But here are a few reasons that many analysts outline to be more bullish in July. Why Is PI Price Falling? Pi launched to crypto exchanges in February at a price around $0.71. In a matter of days, these new altcoins made their way around to $2.79 per token. But PI‚Äôs price has been rolling down hill ever since , with the exception of a strong six day rally in the first half of May. That may be due mostly to technical market factors. The new cryptocurrency ran out of buyers after overheating to the $2.79 level and early adopters have been taking profits in another ‚Äúbuy the rumor, sell the news‚Äù kind of market. In addition to that, the Pi Network has been releasing new supplies onto exchanges. As a result, the relative value of each token already in circulation declined. In uncompromisingly economic markets like cryptocurrency, prices are very sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Meanwhile, the overall crypto market‚Äôs sentiment is bearish, which usually leads traders to go risk off to avoid massive losses in newer, unproven networks. Nvertheless, here are two reasons this relatively newer cryptocurrency with a total market cap north of $4.75 could be worth looking into according to some analysts. 1. Pi Network Whale Activity Rises Whale-sized bites of any cryptocurrency are a bullish signal. Just ask Virginia-based Strategy Inc. executive chairman Michael Saylor about Bitcoin. His company‚Äôs whale-sized feeding frenzies on the diminishing supply of fewer than 21 million BTC tokens, spurs on similar behavior from companies hip to crypto, like New York City‚Äôs BlackRock, Inc. That creates new support for higher and higher rallies on Bitcoin‚Äôs price chart. Pi has fried some big fish too since launching to crypto exchanges in Q1. According to earlier reports, someone made¬†a $14 million purchase of Pi tokens made on OKX and transferred to private wallets. That possibly signals some long-term bullishness for Pi from a crypto whale. Although without staking the tokens, there‚Äôs likely not much to stop this wallet holder from selling all at once to swipe profits from a Pi rally or move his capital to another opportunity in Web3. Pi blockchain data from Pi BlockExplorer also reveals a major buyer purchasing some 290 million Pi tokens over a three month period, valued by markets at around $150 million at the time of the report. 2. PI Price All Time Low, Chance For Value Trade One of the guiding principles of technical market trading is is called mean regression in the lingo of statistical science. It means that a data trend in stock or crypto prices with enough volume over a long enough time period tends to return to its average trend line on the graph after moving away from it given enough time. With an economy like Pi Network‚Äôs, topping a $4.6 billion market cap in June prices near its all time low, a regression to the mean price trend entails a parabolic long-term trend line and a logarithmic scale. While trading stocks at any other time in history, this would be when the technical trader would spot a trend line rapidly going to zero. But in the short history of cryptocurrencies, only 16 years after the launch of Bitcoin, investors have seen this scenario happen over and over again. Pi has already made enormous strides in a short time on exchange markets, and the features and benefits of its currency network have a lot in common with many of the other cryptocurrencies that have frequently delivered triple digit plus average annualized ROIs for investors. If Pi performs like at least a dozen other major altcoins ‚Äî some analysts see this as a potential reason to be bullish.

Earlier this month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said estimates suggest that the stablecoin market cap could grow to $3.7 trillion by 2030. According to Bessent, stablecoins will drive demand for US Treasuries, which ‚Äúcould lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt.‚Äù Stablecoins are dollar-pegged crypto assets, primarily backed by US Treasuries, and commonly used to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In a new interview on The Julia La Roche Show, Gromen explains how the growth of the stablecoin market cap could act as rocket fuel for Bitcoin in the next five years. ‚ÄúI think the US government sees stablecoins, they very clearly see it as a way to financially repress and create an ability to finance deficits at very low rates. Bessent can‚Äôt get $3.7 trillion or $2 trillion even in stablecoin T-bill buying over the next five years without Bitcoin probably being a multiple of where it is today. It‚Äôs very hard to see a world where the stablecoin market cap is bigger than the Bitcoin market cap. As a practical matter, going back the last three or four years, whatever the market cap of total stablecoins, Bitcoin has never been less than two and a half times that, and it‚Äôs been as high as 10 to 12 times that. So if Bessent‚Äôs talking about $3.7 trillion in stablecoins by 2030, in my opinion, he‚Äôs talking about $8 trillion ‚Äì $9 trillion Bitcoin, up from $2.1 trillion today, or up to $30 trillion Bitcoin, up from $2 trillion today. The US government now needs much higher Bitcoin to achieve its stablecoin goals.‚Äù At time of writing, the stablecoin market cap is hovering at $253.2 billion.

By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we‚Äôll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‚Äòs performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia‚Äôs scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price up today? TIA‚Äôs price is attempting to hold above $1.5 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA‚Äôs price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers‚Äô interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction June 2025 Celestia‚Äôs price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.8 and a maximum of $3.4, with an average of $2.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction June 2025 $1.8 $2.5 $3.4 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn‚Äôt felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $2.3, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Some of these investors might be waiting for the price surge triggered by the Bitcoin Halving to maximize their profits. Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA as it reaches its peak moment.

Key Takeaways: At least nine UK-listed firms have announced Bitcoin treasury plans in the past week. Companies like Tao Alpha, Smarter Web Company, and Panther Metals saw share prices soar after Bitcoin buys. The trend comes as the UK eyes a crypto hub future. Over the past week, at least nine UK firms, from web design startups to mining businesses, have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or revealed recent purchases to add the cryptocurrency to their corporate treasuries. These companies are following in the footsteps of Japan‚Äôs Metaplanet and Germany‚Äôs Bitcoin Group, both of which adopted treasury strategies inspired by Saylor‚Äôs billion-dollar Bitcoin bet. Since Saylor‚Äôs move in 2020, his company‚Äôs valuation has surged nearly 400% to over $100 billion. Tao Alpha Eyes ¬£100M Raise for Bitcoin Treasury Plan Among the UK firms, AI services provider Tao Alpha disclosed plans to raise ¬£100 million after revealing a bitcoin treasury plan that triggered investor interest. Smarter Web Company, a small website design firm, saw its market value rocket from ¬£4 million to over ¬£1 billion in just two months after announcing its Bitcoin purchases in April, although shares have since cooled. Natural resources company Panther Metals confirmed this week it bought a single Bitcoin, executing on a strategy it unveiled earlier in June. Its shares are up 81% this month, mirroring bitcoin‚Äôs 74% rise over the past year. Panther CEO Darren Hazelwood said the firm aims to build up ¬£4 million worth of bitcoin holdings ‚Äúas rapidly as we can.‚Äù Bluebird Mining Ventures‚Äô shares have soared nearly 400% since announcing plans to buy bitcoin. Founder Aidan Bishop said the strategy had revived the struggling company, which posted a $898,000 loss last year. The firm has already raised ¬£2 million in debt to fund Bitcoin purchases and is looking for another ¬£10 million. JUST IN: Bluebird Mining, a gold miner, increased their goals and now aims to raise a minimum of ¬£10 million ($13.7 million) to start their ""digital"" gold strategy and buy #bitcoin Yesterday, they announced a ¬£2 million funding facility but they received unprecedented‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/s7G9qkwTIa ‚Äî NLNico (@btcNLNico) June 26, 2025 Meanwhile, Vinanz, originally focused on Bitcoin mining, has increased its Bitcoin holdings to $3.85 million through ongoing equity and debt funding. CEO Hewie Rattray emphasized the growing investor appetite, saying the company offers ‚Äúlisted, regulated access to Bitcoin.‚Äù Vinanz plans to rebrand as the London BTC Company. UK Aims to Become a Global Crypto Hub The flurry of Bitcoin adoption comes as the UK reaffirms its ambitions to become a global crypto hub. The Financial Conduct Authority recently signaled a softening stance, proposing to ease restrictions on certain crypto-linked retail investment products after years of a tough regulatory approach. As reported, the UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred.

Was Iran Mining Bitcoin?

But experts say it is still nearly impossible to give an accurate estimate of how much Bitcoin (BTC) the country has mined. According to data from the University of Cambridge‚Äôs Centre for Alternative Finance in March 2021, Iran accounted for 7.5% of the global Bitcoin mining hashrate. This fell to just 0.12% in January 2022. Andrew Scott Easton, CEO of Bitcoin mining investment firm Masterminded, estimates that Iran has historically mined around 60,000 BTC. That‚Äôs roughly $6.4 billion at current prices. Sazmining CEO Kent Halliburton, on the other hand, says Iran may have mined between 100,000 and 200,000 BTC since 2018, and that the amount could range from $10.7 billion to $21.4 billion. The fact that Iran began granting legal permits for crypto mining in 2019 increases the importance of this period. But forecasts are complicated because much of Iran‚Äôs mining has moved underground to escape high electricity tariffs, said Rajat Ahlawat of regulatory firm Crystal Intelligence. According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran, around 1,000 legal crypto mining farm licenses were issued in 2020, while this number exceeded 10,000 in 2022. However, according to former President Hassan Rouhani, 85% of mining was unlicensed as of 2021. According to data from state electricity company Tavanir, around 700,000 illegal mining devices operate in the country. Ahlawat said licensed miners are unable to make significant profits due to high electricity tariffs, so many people are mining illegally in homes, mosques and schools ‚Äì places with low-cost or free electricity. It is also thought that some organisations affiliated with the Iranian government are also mining in this way. Related News: What's Next for Chainlink (LINK)? Analysis Firm Shares Must-Have Protection and Target Levels Illegal mining operations put a serious strain on the country‚Äôs power grid, occasionally causing power outages across the country. Tavanir has launched a crackdown by offering rewards to those who report these activities. In 2022, 9,404 illegal mining devices were seized in Tehran alone in six months. Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate dropped by 27.9% on Sunday after the US bombed Iran‚Äôs Fordow nuclear facility, which it built deep in the mountains. The drop fueled speculation on social media that Iran was mining Bitcoin in the mountains. However, some mining firms, such as Blocksbridge Consulting, have disputed this theory, stating that short-term hashrate fluctuations can be misleading. Ahlawat said there was no definitive evidence of mining taking place there, although he noted that nuclear facilities like Fordow have adequate electrical infrastructure. But if there were, he said, such an operation would be carried out by the Iranian government or its affiliates. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) stands out as the country‚Äôs largest mining force. According to Easton, the IRGC may be the largest Bitcoin miner in Iran. However, the government‚Äôs history of hiding its mining activities makes it difficult to obtain accurate data in this area. As a result, it is not clear how much Bitcoin Iran has made to date. This is mainly because about 85% of mining activities have gone underground, and the government does not report these activities transparently. However, for many Iranians, crypto mining is one of the few ways they can make a living amid high inflation. *This is not investment advice.

Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications has stagnated, with the charts showing that it is recovering. Recent news: Algorand Foundation- TVL is not correlated with price performance Algorand researchers are attempting to answer the question of whether TVL could predict the performance of a crypto, and after analyzing over 300 cryptocurrencies from 2023 to 2024, they did not find any outperformance, regardless of how the data was adjusted for known issues. The study will be published on June 10. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, The drop could be attributed to the crypto market‚Äôs correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand‚Äôs market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO‚Äôs price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term.

Source: CoinStats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market‚Äôs recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-29 09:00:00

For most, they‚Äôve become cautionary tales of missed exits and short-term hype. That‚Äôs exactly why smart money is now turning to a project with real-world utility and long-term earning potential‚Äî Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, with over 50% of the phase already sold, Mutuum isn‚Äôt just catching attention‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming the talk of seasoned investors. What gives MUTM the edge? While meme coins rely purely on sentiment, Mutuum delivers a functional DeFi lending platform, complete with P2P and P2C earning models, a beta product ready at launch, and certified security through a 95-rated CertiK audit. It‚Äôs value you can measure‚Äînot just meme magic. One prudent investor recently shared how he pulled $7,500 out of DOGE and SHIB positions to buy into Phase 2 at $0.015. Today, that same investment is worth $15,000‚Äîalready 2√ó in growth. He‚Äôs holding until MUTM hits $0.33 or higher, aiming for a 1,000% return, which top analysts say is entirely achievable given the roadmap and low market cap launch structure. With Phase 6 pushing the price to $0.035 soon, the window to get in at a meaningful entry point is closing rapidly. This isn‚Äôt just another DeFi project‚Äîit‚Äôs the one the smart investors are watching. If DOGE and SHIB were luck, Mutuum is a strategy and right now, that strategy is still available for $0.03. Mutuum Finance(MUTM)‚Äôs decentralized model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a decentralized model where users won‚Äôt have to wait for a meme cycle to see returns. Instead, the protocol is being designed to deliver income through real lending and borrowing activity. The P2C and P2P systems together will offer a wide spectrum of earning opportunities. Users will be able to lend their stablecoins and blue-chip tokens into liquidity pools that generate dynamic yields. Meanwhile, risk-tolerant investors will engage in peer-to-peer deals using high-volatility tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE)‚Äîturning meme assets into income-producing instruments. Those same meme coins that do nothing when left in a wallet will, on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), be leveraged to earn interest and participate in broader lending ecosystems. And depositors won‚Äôt be left out. As they supply assets to the protocol, they will receive mtTokens, which will appreciate in value and can also be staked to earn protocol-generated dividends‚Äîrewards that will come from buybacks funded by platform revenues. A smarter structure for smarter gains The rise of meme coins has been entertaining, but investors looking to build sustainable portfolios are now focusing on utility-backed protocols like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Every design choice in the platform reflects that forward-looking strategy. From the use of overcollateralized loans to the minting of a decentralized stablecoin, this is a system meant to grow with real use, not just retail buzz. Its supply of 4 billion tokens ensures increasing value, while upcoming protocol features will anchor value through real demand. The roadmap is both ambitious and structured. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already passed a professional audit by CertiK, scoring 95.00 in Token Scan and earning a 77 Skynet rating‚Äîkey indicators for investors who prioritize safety. Development is deep in Phase 2, with work underway on smart contracts, frontend infrastructure, and backend systems. Once the beta version is ready in Phase 3, it will be tested rigorously before the platform goes live. The team is planning to align the launch of this demo version with the token listing, ensuring that the presale leads directly into real platform access. That launch will kick off Phase 4, which includes staking functionalities, exchange access, and the onboarding of institutional players. Layer-2 integration will ensure a seamless user experience with lower fees and faster transactions‚Äîanother differentiator in a congested DeFi space. Meanwhile, the stablecoin Mutuum is developing will introduce a secure, overcollateralized option for borrowing liquidity, further enhancing the platform‚Äôs versatility. For those already convinced, the current presale pricing presents one of the last chances to secure a position before demand accelerates. And there‚Äôs more: the project‚Äôs $100,000 giveaway is rewarding early believers in real time. Ten winners will be selected to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each‚Äîdelivering instant upside to those who are helping shape the early community. Dog-themed tokens may still trend online, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is where smart capital is heading. It offers earning mechanics instead of meme speculation. It‚Äôs launching real features instead of waiting for a celebrity endorsement. And it‚Äôs still priced at $0.03 in Phase 5, where over 150 million tokens are allocated before the next price increase. DOGE sits idle while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is earning while it builds. Smart investors are already watching‚Äîand acting‚Äîbefore the ecosystem goes live.

With DeFi‚Äôs rapid shifts in market sentiment and volatility, protocols are constantly seeking ways to demonstrate real value accrual to incentivise meaningful participation and build community trust. Token buybacks have emerged as a viable yet polarising strategy: Similar to traditional finance‚Äôs stock buybacks, they involve the repurchasing of tokens from the open market, which in turn reduces supply and potentially drives the token value higher. Critics argue that such moves can artificially inflate prices or divert resources from more productive protocol pursuits. You might also like: The multichain future of global finance is inevitable | Opinion Writing off token buybacks based on these concerns would be premature. Token buybacks that factor in strategic timing, sustainable protocol revenue, and tangible utility are capable of addressing the aforementioned criticisms, delivering long-term value, and becoming a proof-of-resilience in decentralised finance. Such buybacks make a sound strategy when the supply reduction is paired with a deliberate improvement in fundamentals, such as token utility, network effects, and ecosystem growth. Revenue-based buybacks also serve as reliable signals of financial health, as they are funded by actual protocol earnings rather than prior token sales or liquidity mining leftovers. Moreover, buybacks provide sustainable value when they are designed to complement governance incentives, with on-chain execution ensuring transparency. A booster for undervalued tokens Buybacks pose as catalysts for undervalued tokens through a reduction in their circulating supply. In theory, such scarcity generates upward price pressure that can stabilise or enhance token value. In practice, this only holds true if the token has strong fundamentals and real demand. For buybacks to be effective, the token at hand must have actual product-market fit. In addition to healthy token demand, protocols should actively integrate their buyback programme with strategies that increase token utility, foster ecosystem growth, and amplify network effects. Aave‚Äôs ( AAVE ) $4 million buyback programme exemplifies this holistic approach. Its first phase rolled out in April 2025 following Aave DAO‚Äôs approval with over 99% consensus, reflecting high community alignment and belief in the AAVE token‚Äôs underlying utility. The buyback was also part of Aave‚Äôs comprehensive tokenomics overhaul, directly distributing repurchased tokens to stakers and encouraging governance participation. The AAVE token price rose by 14% shortly after implementation, demonstrating how a buyback programme that meets genuine user needs can create demand touchpoints and ecosystem expansion. A signal of financial health Buybacks serve as powerful indicators of a protocol‚Äôs revenue and profitability, showing that the protocol is generating value and is confident enough in its near-future prospects to return it to holders. The key is to distinguish legitimate programmes from deceptive practices by examining the financial sources that fund the token repurchases. Revenue-based buybacks draw on a protocol‚Äôs actual revenue streams to acquire tokens from the open market, establishing a direct link between the token value and the protocol‚Äôs actual performance. These instances typically signal that the protocol is not only surviving but actively thriving, with robust liquidity and a sustainable financial runway. In contrast, buybacks funded by treasury reserves or unused liquidity mining reserves pose as elusive performance indicators. Such mechanisms simply recycle previously distributed tokens back into the markets. This becomes especially problematic for protocols with high-emission models, where they mask ongoing dilution as value-accruing activity. A delivery of long-term value Buybacks also bolster investor confidence by delivering long-term value to token holders and protocol supporters. Unlike their TradFi counterpart, which primarily benefits institutional shareholders, token buybacks are frequently incorporated into protocol governance and community incentive programmes. A noteworthy example of the token buybacks‚Äô communal element is Jupiter ( JUP ) DEX‚Äôs buyback programme . Launched in February 2025, the protocol allocates 50% of its operational revenue to repurchase JUP tokens. As governance tokens, the reduced circulating supply creates a direct feedback loop where protocol success translates to enhanced community governance influence among long-term holders. Many token buybacks are also executed on-chain, allowing anyone to verify the protocol‚Äôs commitment to its buyback goals. Such visibility builds trust, holds the team accountable, and strengthens the protocol‚Äôs reputation for resilience. Paving the way for strategic value and long-term impact Critics regard buybacks as a short-sighted, misleading tactic that glosses over a protocol‚Äôs fundamental issues. Whilst valid, such instances should be attributed to poor planning rather than the strategy itself. Successful buybacks are often attributed to straightforward yet overlooked principles. They should be strategically timed to capitalise on market changes, funded by actual revenue, and designed to encourage engagement with protocol governance. Protocols should also be able to share a comprehensive buyback rationale with their communities, explaining how it contributes to their long-term roadmap and value accrual. What‚Äôs next? Token buybacks remain an impactful strategy for value accrual, provided that they are conducted with strategic planning and the protocol‚Äôs vision in mind. Protocols considering a buyback should evaluate whether they offer the best return on investment among all possible growth strategies, how they contribute to the long-term roadmap, and how to maintain transparency in their processes for the community. On the token holder‚Äôs end, due diligence is essential before participating in a buyback program. Key considerations include how the funds are allocated, how committed the developers are to protocol growth, and why the buyback was even implemented in the first place. Such a thorough assessment will help to avoid scams where liquidity is artificially inflated without proper roadmaps or use cases for the protocol. When executed with purpose and a clear direction, token buybacks make effective catalysts that benefit both protocols and their communities, shining as the ultimate proof-of-resilience in DeFi.

Goldman has put Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TWSC:2330) on its ‚ÄúConviction Buy‚Äù list after already being on its buy list, Insider Monkey reports . TSMC is Taiwan‚Äôs largest company, and shares of TSMC are often considered a ‚Äúpure play‚Äù on semiconductors as the firm manufactures chips for some of the world‚Äôs biggest tech firms, including Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm. Goldman says it is raising its price target on TSMC based on cooling concerns about large AI-chip order cuts and increasing demand for the company‚Äôs CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate with silicon interposer) tech designed to power ultra-high-performance computing for AI and other applications. The bank also believes that more smartphone, server and networking customers of TSMC will start adopting CoWoS tech. Goldman is projecting the company‚Äôs dollar revenue to grow by 29% this year and 17% in 2026. The firm has upped its price target for TSM to NT$1,210 from NT$1,145. At time of writing, TSMC is trading at NT$1,080. Reaching Goldman‚Äôs price target suggests a 12% rally from current prices.

Just a day after Trump publicly praised Bitcoin for boosting the US economy, Schiff took to X and warned that increased Bitcoin adoption is placing the dollar under immense strain . ‚ÄúSelling dollars to buy Bitcoin puts added pressure on the dollar,‚Äù he posted. ‚ÄúAlso, wasting resources on Bitcoin is harmful to our country.‚Äù Trump hails crypto‚Äôs economic power During a White House press conference on Friday, Trump praised the crypto industry as a formidable economic machine that the nation cannot sit and watch pass it by. Trump said that crypto has become incredible. He noted that it is producing many jobs, and he sees more and more people using Bitcoin for transactions. Trump noted that people are saying it will also take off a lot of pressure on the dollar, which would be a very good thing for their country. Trump‚Äôs change of tune could be a significant milestone in transitioning toward mainstream adoption of digital currencies in the American economy. Anders X, a digital asset researcher, said Trump‚Äôs comments could reference the Triffin Dilemma . This perennial economic paradox emphasizes the tension between a nation‚Äôs domestic monetary policy and its role as a global reserve currency. This theory holds that because the global trade system is anchored on the US dollar, it creates a structural imbalance that can weaken the currency over time. Schiff warns of dollar collapse as Trump doubles down on Bitcoin strategy Schiff argues that the mass conversion of US dollars into Bitcoin weakens demand for the greenback, and by doing so, it loses its monopoly as the world‚Äôs reserve currency. His remarks starkly contrast with those made by Trump, who described Bitcoin as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù and alleviated pressure on the dollar by creating jobs and outperforming the stock market. The Trump administration has allegedly considered taking a Bitcoin-focused investment to fund a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using assets seized in connection with criminal and civil forfeiture. Several US states are now following suit, allocating capital to build their own Bitcoin reserves. Trump‚Äôs personal ties to the crypto industry have grown stronger. Trump Media recently secured $2.3 billion through private placement to fund its Bitcoin treasury operations. According to Schiff, transforming US dollars from stock and note sales to Bitcoin carries a lot of financial risk. Schiff did not limit his misgivings to macroeconomic risks ‚Äî he also attacked Trump for raising Bitcoin for campaign contributions. The economist says Trump‚Äôs enthusiasm for digital assets is a play for wealthy crypto donors as the next election season nears. The backlash comes after Trump‚Äôs controversial May dinner with some of the top holders of the TRUMP meme coin . According to reports, roughly $150 million was spent for a seat at the table, though critics say the Trump family has made over $1 billion from its crypto business. Further adding to the crypto frenzy, the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) company associated with Trump recently received a $100 million backing from Aqua 1 to promote its decentralized finance (DeFi) efforts. The Trump family adopted Bitcoin because it was debanked from traditional financial institutions. As Trump continues to embrace crypto both politically and personally, Schiff‚Äôs warnings highlight the growing divide between Bitcoin advocates and traditional economists.

This $0.03 Project Has More Utility Than 90% of the Market,https://timestabloid.com/summers-most-overlooked-crypto-this-0-03-project-has-more/,"In a season where meme coins trend for days and disappear just as fast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly stealing the spotlight. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, with over 50% of this stage sold, it‚Äôs quickly emerging as the hidden utility powerhouse of the summer. Unlike hype-driven tokens, MUTM brings real DeFi mechanics, including P2P/P2C lending and a beta platform launching with the token‚Äîa feature even some top 20 coins still can‚Äôt deliver. Analysts project the token could reach $1.35‚Äì$1.50 in the months following listing. At just $0.03 now, that‚Äôs a 45x upside. So, if you enter with $2,200 today, you could walk away with over $99,000 if targets are met. Early investors who secured positions at $0.01 and $0.015 are already sitting on 200‚Äì300% gains, and many have publicly expressed regret for not buying even more. Now, as Mutuum gains momentum across Telegram, CoinMarketCap discussions, and X, new investors are racing to enter before Phase 6 increases the price to $0.035. With the platform‚Äôs utility already underway, and attention growing daily, this is the kind of low-entry, high-upside project that doesn‚Äôt stay overlooked for long. Blink now, and you‚Äôll be reading about it at $0.035 instead of buying it at $0.03. Multiple Systems, One Token, Real Value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its dual lending architecture‚Äîone of the most versatile models being developed in DeFi today. On the one side, the P2C (peer-to-contract) lending system will allow users to deposit assets like ETH, USDC, or SOL into smart contract-based liquidity pools. These deposits will instantly generate mtTokens, representing both the principal and the interest it earns over time. As borrowing activity increases, so will interest rates, resulting in rising returns for early depositors. On the other side, a dedicated P2P (peer-to-peer) system will empower users to directly negotiate loans in more volatile assets like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE‚Äîunlocking even higher return potential for those willing to take on targeted risk. Beyond just earning yield, mtTokens will serve as a multi-functional financial instrument. They will be transferable, usable as collateral for further borrowing, and eligible for staking rewards through revenue buybacks funded by protocol fees. This creates a powerful feedback loop in which lending activity feeds token demand, and holding the token delivers long-term benefits beyond price appreciation. The platform‚Äôs native stablecoin design will further anchor the system with reliability. Minted only when users borrow against overcollateralized assets like ETH and burned once loans are repaid or liquidated, this decentralized stablecoin will aim to remain pegged at $1 through a combination of governance-controlled interest rate adjustments and arbitrage incentives. With collateralized minting, strict issuance limits, and automatic liquidation mechanisms, Mutuum is designing a system where liquidity and safety can coexist in a fully decentralized framework. This functionality will be further enhanced by the use of Layer-2 infrastructure, allowing faster, cheaper transactions for both borrowers and lenders. The move to Layer-2 will ensure that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains accessible even during high network traffic, giving it a practical advantage over legacy DeFi platforms still struggling with high gas fees and sluggish execution. Undervalued and Underpriced‚Äîbut Not for Long While other tokens inflate on social hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is combining technical delivery with tokenomics that reward early conviction. The current presale is already 50% sold at $0.03, with over $11.3 million raised and more than 12,600 holders already in position. The price will rise to $0.035 in Phase 6, en route to a planned listing at $0.06‚Äîmeaning investors entering now are positioning themselves for a 100% return even before the token hits exchanges. But price action is just one part of the picture. The project‚Äôs roadmap is pacing toward the beta launch of the full platform, expected to go live around the token debut. This next development phase will include smart contract deployment, frontend and backend infrastructure, analytics tools, and regulatory readiness. The team has already initiated a CertiK audit, with a Token Score of 95 and a Skynet Score of 77‚Äîfurther reinforcing the protocol‚Äôs credibility and commitment to security. Early supporters also stand to benefit from the ongoing $100,000 giveaway , with ten winners set to receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. This not only rewards early believers but deepens the sense of community and long-term participation. And with revenue from the platform being reinvested into MUTM buybacks and staker distributions, holding the token becomes more than a speculative move‚Äîit becomes a gateway to sustained passive income. This summer, many crypto projects are trying to ride market momentum without any product or purpose behind them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking the opposite approach: building a high-utility ecosystem first, and letting token growth naturally follow. It offers one of the rare combinations in today‚Äôs DeFi scene‚Äîtechnical credibility, economic scalability, and user-focused mechanics. Summer fades, but long-term opportunity doesn‚Äôt. At just $0.03, investors are gaining exposure to a full-featured DeFi experience that is built to last‚Äîand built to grow. For those seeking more than hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers more real utility than 90% of the market, and the window to get in early is already starting to close.

The notices out have surged 758% in the past two months alone, according to CoinLedger. The trend was confirmed by the firm‚Äôs CEO, David Kemmerer, in a statement to The Block, with tax experts also reporting the spike. Everyday Investors Left in the Dark CoinLedger tax expert Ben Yoder noted that most of those who were targeted keep crypto in a passive position and believed they already paid taxes. Errors of wallet-to-wallet transfers or failing to provide cost basis information have a way of triggering IRS suspicions even without tax evasion. What the IRS Letters Mean The most frequent notice sent out, IRS Notice 6174, is informational. But stricter notices, such as 6173 and CP2000, demand action and can lead to audits or penalties. CoinLedger advises the recipient not to ignore such an alert and obtain professional advice. New Rules on the Horizon Kemmerer is convinced the increase in letters can be an indicator of a larger IRS enforcement wave before 2026, the year when the new Form 1099-DA guidelines become applicable. Under these guidelines, crypto brokers will have to report gain/loss information with higher accuracy. Political Noise, Legal Reality Despite the public support from former President Donald Trump for reversing crypto taxes, no legislation has been passed. Crypto analyst Adam Cochran recently mocked news that an executive order could exempt tax expenses, again explaining that congressional approval would be required. Trump did move back an IRS rule earlier this year that would have categorized DeFi platforms as brokers.

Analysis Firm Shares Must-Have Protection and Target Levels REX Shares announced on the same day via the X platform that the Solana staking ETF is coming ‚Äúvery soon.‚Äù Although there is no direct statement about the Ethereum staking ETF, both funds are included in the registration documents filed with the SEC. The ETFs will be traded on the Cboe BZX exchange under the symbols ESK (ETH staking ETF) and SSK (SOL staking ETF), respectively. This development comes amidst a particularly competitive environment, particularly on the Solana side. Major firms such as Invesco and Galaxy have also applied for spot Solana ETFs. Eric Balchunas said these funds could be approved in two to four months. But REX-Osprey‚Äôs approach offers a compelling legal solution to bypass this approval process. Unlike most ETFs, the funds opt for taxable C-corporation status, which allows staking income to be taxed within the fund before being passed on to investors as dividends. While management fees for both funds are set at 0.75%, the total cost is expected to be higher due to income taxes. *This is not investment advice.

This is not another speculative ticker riding on hype. At just $0.03 in its ongoing Phase 5 presale, MUTM is directly connected to core DeFi utility: real borrowing, real lending, real returns. Over $11.25 million has already been raised from more than 12,500 holders, and the project is preparing for a beta launch aligned with regulatory best practices. The price is currently locked at $0.03 in Phase 5 of the presale, and tokens are being claimed quickly. Once Phase 6 begins, the entry price will rise‚Äîand with listing coming closer, the opportunity to buy into a real DeFi platform at basement value is closing. A $1,500 investment today would be worth $45,000 with just a 30√ó move. Considering the protocol‚Äôs utility and revenue model, many are aiming for exactly that. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to become a decentralized liquidity protocol where users lend, borrow, and earn through a trustless system. Unlike ETFs that track crypto prices without offering actual utility, MUTM will power a platform that delivers on-chain income through mtTokens, pool lending, and a built-in stablecoin system‚Äîall underpinned by a security-first architecture and Layer 2 integration for scalability. With the U.S. SEC moving closer to approving broader crypto investment vehicles, the spotlight is returning to underlying fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by prioritizing infrastructure and user ownership instead of speculation. Investors entering now are positioning themselves ahead of the next phase‚Äîbefore the real value unlocks. A token that does more than move in price At the center of the Mutuum ecosystem is the MUTM token, designed to carry multiple roles that link directly to protocol usage. When users deposit assets into Mutuum‚Äôs liquidity pools, they receive mtTokens‚Äîinterest-bearing ERC-20 tokens representing their share of the pool. These mtTokens accumulate value as pool utilization increases and borrowers pay interest. Investors will also be able to stake mtTokens in designated contracts to receive passive dividends in MUTM, funded through protocol revenue and buyback programs. These buybacks will occur on the open market, distributing MUTM to long-term contributors and incentivizing deeper participation. This system transforms passive capital into compounding yield streams. As liquidity demand grows, token holders will benefit‚Äînot only from market price but from the income generated on-chain. Borrowers, in turn, will lock up collateral and receive loans without needing to sell core assets like ETH or BTC. Interest rates will auto-adjust based on pool usage, keeping capital efficient and rewards aligned with activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also introduce a fully decentralized stablecoin that will only be minted when users borrow against assets like ETH. The stablecoin‚Äôs peg will be maintained through interest rate adjustments by governance, along with automated arbitrage mechanisms. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin will be burned, keeping the supply controlled and backed by overcollateralized debt. This approach removes speculative instability and builds a robust tool for users seeking stable on-chain liquidity. To support real-world application, all of this will be deployed with Layer 2 scalability. High-speed, low-cost transactions will allow users to engage with the platform efficiently‚Äîno long delays, no heavy fees. This infrastructure upgrade makes whale-level participation feasible while staying accessible to smaller users. Mutuum is being built for long-term scale, not short-term hype. Security is also front and center. The project has already completed a CertiK audit using both static and manual methods, earning a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 77. These metrics reflect a codebase and protocol structure that meet high security standards, further reinforced by an ongoing bug bounty to catch vulnerabilities before launch. Utility first, regulation ready‚Äîand still just $0.03 While financial headlines follow ETF filings and institutional capital inflows, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning with the next phase of DeFi‚Äîcompliance-ready, utility-driven protocols that empower users without intermediaries. According to its roadmap, Mutuum is preparing to launch its beta platform in Phase 3, followed by token claim in Phase 4. The infrastructure, smart contracts, and Layer 2 deployment will all go live with the token, giving holders immediate access to lending, borrowing, mtTokens, and stablecoin minting. This full-stack launch approach stands in sharp contrast to many projects that deliver speculative tokens with little to no application. With MUTM, the price is tied to protocol activity from the beginning. This means early investors won‚Äôt have to wait for a roadmap catch-up‚Äîthey‚Äôll be entering a working ecosystem on day one. To further reward early participants, Mutuum is running a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, emphasizing the project‚Äôs commitment to building with its community. With over 10,000 social followers and momentum building fast, this initiative is driving organic growth that doesn‚Äôt rely on influencers or manufactured hype. While mainstream investors watch charts and wait for ETFs to launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already laying the rails for decentralized finance 2.0. This is not the time to observe from the sidelines‚Äîit‚Äôs the time to act before the full potential is priced in. The real build is happening now, and it starts with utility.

This progress follows what analysts have described as a positive response from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after REX Shares submitted an updated prospectus reflecting feedback from the regulator. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the updated documents were fully completed, adding that ‚Äúall systems go for imminent launch.‚Äù SEC Comfortable with Rare ETF Structure The potential launch signals a shift in the SEC‚Äôs stance toward crypto staking ETFs . Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, noted that the SEC appears comfortable with REX Shares‚Äô use of a rare C-corp structure under the ‚Äò40 Act for its fund, despite the SEC‚Äôs earlier concerns regarding conflicts with the 6C-11 ‚ÄúETF rule.‚Äù Geraci highlighted that this approach allowed REX Shares to bypass the standard 19b-4 filing process that other crypto ETF providers have relied on for staking proposals, which remain under SEC review. Echoing this, ETF analyst James Seyffart described the structure as ‚Äúvery rare in the ETF world,‚Äù indicating it provided a strategic pathway to move forward. Analysts also noted that SEC comments appear to have been resolved, with Balchunas confirming through an email screenshot that REX Shares is clear to proceed. ‚ÄúSo they are good to launch, it looks like. Wow,‚Äù Balchunas remarked, while Geraci commented, ‚ÄúCrypto ETF summer commences.‚Äù A New Era for Staking in Crypto ETFs On the same day, REX Shares confirmed that ‚Äúthe first-ever staked crypto ETF‚Äù in the U.S. is on its way, emphasizing that its REX-Osprey SOL and staking ETF will track Solana‚Äôs price while generating on-chain yields for investors. Staking has been a highly anticipated feature in crypto ETFs, with many in the industry considering it essential for the next phase of crypto investment products. Earlier this year, BlackRock‚Äôs head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, described their Ether ETF as successful but acknowledged it would be ‚Äúless perfect‚Äù without staking capabilities. As the crypto investment landscape evolves, the imminent launch of REX Shares‚Äô Solana staking ETF could represent a turning point , offering investors exposure to yield-generating crypto assets through regulated investment vehicles.

According to Fred Rispoli, an attorney closely monitoring the case, the court‚Äôs temporary restraining order pertains specifically to institutional XRP sales Ripple made before 2018. That means the company‚Äôs current and future sales to institutions are still legal, so long as they do not mirror the structure of those early transactions. The SEC asserts that Ripple‚Äôs $728 million XRP to institutional investors from 2013 to 2018 amounted to illegal sales of unregistered securities under US law. The judge ruled in favor of Ripple‚Äôs argument that it did not conduct securities transactions when it sold the digital asset XRP to the public through so-called crypto exchanges. However, regarding institutional sales during the company‚Äôs early years, the court agreed with the SEC that they were unregistered securities offerings. Accordingly, the court cited inflation concerns to justify an injunction preventing Ripple from repeating its 2018-style institutional sales, which involved selling 3% of its XRP holdings. As a result, a limited injunction was issued to block Ripple from conducting similar transactions. However, attorney Fred Rispoli clarified that this does not prohibit Ripple from making institutional sales entirely‚Äîonly from using the same structure that previously drew regulatory scrutiny . Farrell and Morgan weigh in on Ripple‚Äôs regulatory future James Farrell, a legal commentator in cryptocurrency who also examined the case, agreed with Rispoli‚Äôs interpretation. He stressed that the injunction is not an all-out prohibition of institutional sales. Instead, it enjoins Ripple from breaking Section 5 of the Securities Act, which involves the sale of unregistered securities. Farrell said Ripple could still theoretically sell XRP to institutions, provided the transactions go through the proper regulatory channels. He explained that one option is for the company to request a ‚Äúno-action letter‚Äù from the SEC, which would formally assure that the described activity would not trigger enforcement action. Farrell‚Äôs take also dovetails with that of former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel. The advocate has said he believes the SEC will eventually abandon its appeal‚Äîa decision that would finally end the four-year legal showdown. But he added that the appeal is still live, so the case could still be considered ‚Äúongoing‚Äù. Another prominent lawyer, Bill Morgan, added a new wrinkle to the debate, writing that a settlement can only become a done deal if the SEC has to vote again to approve the conditions. It‚Äôs a reminder of how many layers of regulatory processes are still in effect. Ripple adapts strategy to keep on the right side of regulators With legal developments hanging in the balance, Ripple has overhauled its strategy for selling to big-money institutional players. The company‚Äôs management says that it no longer does the sort of deals that attracted the scrutiny of the SEC. There has been a deliberate change in strategy on how it has managed XRP sales since 2018. The company has ramped up disclosures, held conversations with regulators and even explored filing registration statements to adhere more strictly to compliance. However, the proactive strategy is far from its old veil-of-secrecy approach to sales. Some analysts also argue that the change in SEC leadership could promote Ripple‚Äôs revised strategy. Though former SEC Chair Gary Gensler was seen as anti-crypto, changing leadership and regulations could usher in a more balanced perspective. That could lessen the chance of further enforcement actions against Ripple for its institutional activities. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round now live, the project is quietly drawing in serious attention. Its AI-native blockchain design, featuring a purpose-built virtual machine and a consensus model that rewards real computation, sets it apart from hype-based plays. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming the smart pick for those looking past the noise and into the future.

Financial and technical indicators are all bullish, with‚ÄÇindicators such as the bullish flag and the potential formation of a mini golden cross, enabling DOGE to surge towards its $0.25 and possibly $0.48 hurdle. Furthermore, the gathering of whales and rising network activity point to greater conviction in‚ÄÇthe asset. As the likes of newer meme coins come and go, the strong community and cultural relevance that is Dogecoin ensures it continues to remain a‚ÄÇplayer in the crypto space. Savvy Traders Turn Attention to Lightchain AI‚Äôs Strategic Growth Savvy traders are now turning their attention to Lightchain AI, drawn by its methodical approach to growth and long-term infrastructure. Unlike hype-driven projects, Lightchain AI has quietly gained ground through clear utility, sound tokenomics, and developer-focused incentives. Following the completion of Stage 15, the Bonus Round began‚Äîoffering fixed pricing and signaling a shift toward execution. The original 5% Team Allocation was fully removed and reallocated to fund protocol development, grants, and builder incentives. Decentralized validator and contributor nodes, combined with upcoming GitHub repository releases, reinforce transparency and decentralization. Cross-chain infrastructure, DeFi partnership onboarding, and tools like the Meme Launchpad show the ecosystem is alive and expanding. For traders who value structure over speculation, Lightchain AI offers a rare mix of momentum and meaning. Lightchain AI- Silent Revolution Taking Over Spotlight The game is changing, and Lightchain AI is stealing the show‚Äîquietly but powerfully. In private chats and trader circles, all eyes are on its $0.007 Bonus Round, decentralized governance, and builder-first incentives fueled by the reallocated 5% team allocation.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) hold the top positions, while meme coins have entered the speculative territory of retail investors and even institutional investors seeking high-risk, high-reward investments. Memes are extremely popular, and among the numerous successful meme coins, four tokens reign in the charts this month. These meme coins are expected to offer substantial payouts within the year 2025 and beyond. We will break down the four hottest meme coins that people simply cannot stop buying these days and explain why 2025 might be the year when these tokens skyrocket. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Mem Coin that has Real Infrastructure Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is trembling in the echoes of the meme-coins reality, and it is due to the peculiar combination of meme culture and practicality. Whereas most meme coins exist due to the hype created by the community, LILPEPE utilizes Layer-2 blockchain technology, enabling tax-free transactions, protection against sniper bots, and super-fast payments. The mentioned characteristics make LILPEPE one of the most promising tokens in 2025. More than $1 million has already been raised during the presale of LILPEPE, and the token is becoming popular on social media networks. LILPEPE Investors are rushing into the coin, hoping to reap a 25 thousand percent rally by 2026. LILPEPE has the advantage of the project launching Pad, Pepe Pump Pad: a launchpad where meme coin creators can lock their liquidity and prevent rug pulls. With ample expansion opportunities and the vast support of the community, LILPEPE may become a new meme coin that takes over the market. Don't miss the chance to take part in the presale and secure your place before the next boom. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Legacy of the Meme Coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) is yet another leading cryptocurrency in the meme coin market, thanks to its devoted community and the rising popularity of Shibarium, its Layer-2 scaling solution. SHIB still has a substantial following and loyal followers, despite the emergence of more recent meme coins, such as LILPEPE. SHIB is currently valued at $0.00001163 as of June 2025, indicating that the coin is likely to experience further rallies in the future, given the constant growth of its Shiba Inu ecosystem, which includes applications such as NFTs and DeFi. Although SHIB has achieved little beyond memes to drive hype and utility, the Shiba Inu community is one of the strongest within the entire crypto market, which supports it in the long term. Now, as Shibarium will make transactions more efficient and lower gas fees, Shib still has enormous room to grow through 2025, making it a prime meme coin to follow. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin Created January 6 and established as a testing project around December 6, 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) has scarcely lost ground due to the widespread recognition of the brand and endorsements by heavyweight individuals such as Elon Musk. DOGE is trading at an approximate value of USD0.1650 in June 2025. Although the value of the coin may fluctuate, its cultural popularity and institutional endorsement will likely continue to weigh significantly more for it compared to most newer coins. DOGE is becoming a confirmed digital currency in multiple ecosystems as more use cases are adopted for tipping, transactions, and payments. Its long-term growth is unlikely to be as explosive as that of other promising tokens, but DOGE is one of the best options for an investor seeking an established and relatively stable meme coin that has not yet reached its peak. Pepecoin (PEPE): The Emerging Meme Coin Pepe Coin (PEPE) has been another scorching-hot meme coin of mass appeal in 2025. The viral hype for this one is high, riding on the classic Pepe the Frog meme, an icon that has achieved great fame within the meme coin community. With strong community support and a widened presence on social media, PEPE is positioning itself to make a significant impact. Unlike other meme coins, PEPE has capitalized on the popularity of internet memes and is characterized by low transaction costs and a cult-like following. As revealed by the recent price increase, leading PEPE has risen to $0.00000001, reaching the level of $0.00009, and is poised to dislodge the market leaders. Gathering increasing interest from retail investors and with the potential for further viral growth, PEPE is one of the most impressive meme coin stories of 2025. Here is Why These Meme Coins Will Glitter in 2025 When 2025 arrives, one thing is apparent: the meme coin market is changing. Amidst the current market environment, investors increasingly desire coins with actual infrastructure, in addition to the viral aspect present in meme coins. This is the reason why LILPEPE, SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE are becoming the hottest coins in 2025: Blockchain Layer-2: The breakthroughs in the sphere of blockchain technology, including Layer-2 scaling, have made it possible to process transactions more quickly and affordably than before, with some coins, such as LILPEPE and SHIB. Strong sense of community: The meme coin thrives because it has a strong sense of community. SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE all have dedicated fan bases that continue to bolster them, and LILPEPE is soon developing its excellent fan base. Gigantic growth potential: Notably, whereas DOGE and SHIB are already established, LILPEPE and PEPE are poised to have advantages in terms of innovative aspects and viral growth potential. These coins are expected to perform better in 2025 than their predecessors. How to Purchase LILPEPE And Other Hot Meme Coins And once you are willing to take advantage of the next great meme coin, here is how you can purchase LILPEPE and other best tokens in presale: Install either the MetaMask or the Trust Wallet Deposit to your wallet ETH or USDT (ERC-20) Go to the LILPEPE official website at littlepepe.com Link your wallet and buy the token right away Conclusion: Meme Coins That Are Going to Fly in 2025 The future of the 2025 meme coin market is looking more competitive than ever before, with the names of LILPEPE, SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE emerging as market leaders.

Key Takeaways: South Korea‚Äôs Kospi index surged nearly 30% YTD over the past week. The rally is driven by President Lee‚Äôs pledge to support won-backed stablecoins. Stocks like Kakao Pay and ME2ON soared as retail investors piled into crypto-linked shares. Shares of companies linked to the Bank of Korea‚Äôs digital currency initiative , including Kakao Pay and LG CNS, have soared since Lee‚Äôs announcement, with Kakao Pay more than doubling in value this month and LG CNS climbing nearly 70% before pulling back slightly, FT reported . On the Kosdaq junior market, Aton, a fintech security firm, saw its shares jump 80%, while mobile game developer ME2ON tripled after its subsidiary launched a dollar-pegged stablecoin for casino platforms. Kospi Stock Soars 30% YTD, Crowned Korea‚Äôs Best-Performing Market in H1 2025 The rally has pushed South Korea‚Äôs Composite Stock Price Index or KOSPI up almost 30% this year, lifting it to near four-year highs and making it Asia‚Äôs top-performing market for the first half of 2025. Retail investors have flocked to the rally, with outstanding margin loans swelling to Won20.5 trillion ($15 billion), data from the Korea Financial Investment Association shows. Despite the euphoria, the government has yet to reveal specific policies for won-based stablecoins, leaving the market to trade on expectations fueled by President Lee‚Äôs appointment of Kim Yong-beom , a well-known digital asset advocate, as his chief policy adviser. Momentum has been further supported by a bill introduced by the ruling party this month, proposing to allow companies with as little as Won500 million in equity to issue won-based stablecoins. Critics warn this could expose the financial system to undercapitalized players and heighten systemic risks. Kakao Pay, Kakao Entertainment, Kakao Corp. All holding $KAIA .

Banks, brokerages, and fintech firms are eager to enter the stablecoin space but remain wary of forthcoming regulations. Bank of Korea governor Rhee Chang-yong has voiced concerns about stablecoins issued by non-bank entities, highlighting risks to capital flows and monetary policy. The central bank plans to consult major lenders on a second pilot for its digital currency. Korea‚Äôs FSC Eyes Spot Crypto ETFs As reported, South Korea‚Äôs Financial Services Commission (FSC) has presented a roadmap to the Presidential Committee on Policy Planning proposing the approval of spot crypto ETFs . The move came after President Lee Jae-myung‚Äôs campaign promise to modernize digital asset rules and boost opportunities for younger investors. The plan outlines implementation measures for spot crypto ETFs and regulatory frameworks for won-based stablecoins in the second half of 2025. Historically, the FSC blocked crypto ETFs over volatility and financial risk concerns, maintaining that cryptocurrencies were unsuitable as underlying assets.

Monero: The Cryptocurrency Championing Privacy in a Transparent World Monero, launched in 2014, is a digital currency focused on privacy and anonymity.

TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators in a Decentralized Web TRON is a blockchain platform aiming to decentralize the internet and empower content creators.

47018863,https://crypto.news/?p=14392612,1751196240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/47018863.jpeg,‚ÄòBitcoin is the hurdle rate‚Äô: What does it mean in the age of crypto?,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-is-the-hurdle-rate-what-does-it-mean-in-the-age-of-crypto/,"Phrases like ‚ÄúBitcoin is the hurdle rate‚Äù and ‚ÄúBitcoin is the new hurdle rate‚Äù frequently re-occur in the Bitcoin communities, often without a context. In short, this motto means that Bitcoin is the best benchmark for investment: avoid investing in anything that yields lower returns than Bitcoin. Let‚Äôs delve deeper into the meaning of this phrase and explore what this credo challenges and why some find it controversial. What is the hurdle rate? The hurdle rate indicates the minimum return that makes an investment or a project viable. The hurdle rate is used while deciding whether to start a business project or make an investment. If it is too high, the project or an investment may be rejected. To determine a hurdle rate, one considers costs, inflation, interest rates, and potential risks. Some companies use their weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as a reference for the hurdle rate. However, some add the risk premium to WACC to get a safer hurdle rate. It‚Äôs understood that the return on investment rate should be above the hurdle rate so that the investment would be viable. The current yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bills is often used as a benchmark when calculating the hurdle rate, as it serves as the risk-free rate, since other investments are typically riskier. Some models use 3-month treasury bills instead. And that‚Äôs what Bitcoin maxis are challenging when they say Bitcoin is the hurdle rate. How is Bitcoin the hurdle rate? There are at least two messages attached to the ‚ÄúBitcoin is the hurdle rate‚Äù motto. First off, bitcoiners point out the poor performance of the U.S. Treasury bills if compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. The second meaning of Bitcoin as the hurdle rate is that sometimes you should just buy Bitcoin instead of trying to find a better-performing investment. Bitcoin is the hurdle rate. If you can't beat it just buy it. Few ‚Äî Global HODL üüß (@global_hodl) June 25, 2025 Explaining how Bitcoin is better than t-bills, Bitcoin enthusiasts usually emphasize Bitcoin‚Äôs predictability, citing the hard supply cap of nearly 21 million units, the pre-programmed issuance of new bitcoins, predetermined dates of halvings, etceters. Additionally, Bitcoin exhibits strong long-term price appreciation. In the past, there were no negative returns in any 5-year period. The constant long-term value accumulation is cited as one of the main reasons for the inclusion of Bitcoin in various state or corporate reserves. None of these is the case for the U.S. Treasury bills, nor for gold, which is an asset most frequently compared with Bitcoin. While U.S. Treasury bills are usually chosen as the benchmark for the hurdle rate because they are considered a risk-free asset, many admit that risks are there. If you look at the chart, you may notice that the yield is subjected to serious volatility. In 2008, the yield rate fell below 1% and was this low until 2015. The COVID-19 pandemic managed to crash the yield rate again in 2020. At the same time, cryptocurrencies began to grow following the March 2020 market crash. In those days, many observers admitted that Bitcoin proved itself as a safe haven asset. The latest drop in the T-bill yield occurred in 2024. U.S. Treasury bill yield rates depend on various factors, including the actions of the Federal Reserve, in a centralized manner, not thinkable for Bitcoin. The incumbent POTUS, Donald Trump, is calling on the Fed to cut the rates, which it, as an independent agency, refuses to do, citing the inflation threat as the reason. Once the Fed complies and cuts the rates, the yield on Treasury bills will go down. Some expect that the increased inflation will propel Bitcoin‚Äôs price up. Read more: Inflation is up but below expectations. Will the Fed cut rates, and what does this mean for the crypto market? Despite the fact that other traditional assets are considered even riskier, bitcoiners argue that the U.S. Treasury bills are not a suitable risk-free benchmark asset, and Bitcoin is a better fit. Bitcoin‚Äôs recognition by governments, financial institutions, corporations, and high-profile financial experts (including former Bitcoin skeptics) may solidify Bitcoin‚Äôs reputation as the benchmark. Bitcoin treasury companies, like Strategy, Metaplanet, or Nakamoto, emphasize that Bitcoin yield outperforms yield from other assets, so the accumulation of Bitcoin and releasing stocks that expose buyers to indirect ‚Äúownership‚Äù of Bitcoin is presented as a viable strategy. So far, MSTR (Strategy‚Äôs stock) has seen higher returns than the returns from Bitcoin itself. Until the Bitcoin treasuries bubble burst, Bitcoin may have been seen as the hurdle rate for treasury companies: if you can‚Äôt outperform Bitcoin, then you should own it. Adam Back says, "" #Bitcoin is effectively the hurdle rate, if you can't outperform Bitcoin you should at least hold some of it."" pic.twitter.com/iUbzap8zaA ‚Äî Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNews21M) June 16, 2025 However, hard-core Bitcoin enthusiasts warn that holding Bitcoin self-custody is safer than outsourcing BTC ownership to a centralized third party, whether it is a crypto exchange, treasury company, or anything else. Why do some dispute this claim? Some of the Bitcoin purists ridicule the idea that Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate‚Äînotably those critical towards Bitcoin treasury companies per se. ""If bitcoin is the hurdle rate, that means merely holding bitcoin is losing. You've got outperform it by buying my stonk. I promise you, my stock is exactly the same as bitcoin, but with more torque."" pic.twitter.com/U26rRZyvuV ‚Äî Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 8, 2025 The logic is clear: as the Bitcoin treasury companies‚Äô frontmen weaponized the hurdle rate concept, it may be seen as a gimmick to promote these companies‚Äô stocks as performing as well or even better than Bitcoin. They often discuss Bitcoin while selling traditional stocks to their clients. Bitcoin is the hurdle rate. pic.twitter.com/BtRDBWrJJE ‚Äî Hermes Lux (@HermesLux) June 13, 2025 So, generally, ‚ÄúBitcoin is the hurdle rate‚Äù can serve as an economic observation, a slogan for treasury companies, or at least a Crypto Twitter meme.

As risk appetite returns, savvy investors are eyeing the top crypto coins to buy and hold during this fragile calm. Ethereum (ETH) remains a foundational asset amid macro recovery, but the real buzz is building around a high-upside newcomer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The token sits at phase 5 of presale for $0.03. Having already smashed through more than $11.2 million raised and indicating more than 12,500 investors, Mutuum Finance is starting ripples. As market sentiment swings back toward growth, many are asking what‚Äôs the best crypto to buy in 2025, and Mutuum Finance is increasingly making that shortlist. While ETH offers long-term strength, MUTM may offer breakout potential as investors position ahead of the next altcoin wave. Ethereum Holds Steady Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a recovery but the exchange rate is almost at the price of $2442 and it indicates stabilization after tensions in the Middle East coolded off. Analysts observe that ETH is being held up by institutional interest as witnessed by a high level of whale accumulation of more than $422‚ÄØmillion in the last few weeks. In the meantime, on-chain indicators such as the daily active addresses dipped due to geopolitical tension but the indicator has since recovered as investor morale strengthened. As the market is currently settled, ETH is probably at the stage of gradual acquisition, offering a secure background despite a growing interest in other altcoins, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has reached above 12 thousand investors in a presale that exceeds more than $11.2 million. Project hype is at its peak and this is certainly a great sign of the future of the project. MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.03 in phase 5 but will soar 16.67% in phase 6. The demand is becoming exponentially high and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a game-changer in DeFi is all the more valuable considering that it will be amongst the top-trending crypto investments of 2025. Grab Free MUTM, $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance is attempting to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 in MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time‚Äôs running out. Don‚Äôt miss your opportunity to be one of the winners and, in the process, a place as one of the hottest new DeFi projects everyone is discussing. Mutuum Finance Doubles Down on Trust with $50,000 Bug Bounty Program The majority of DeFi protocols fail because they are all talk and no action but Mutuum Finance is making failure hard by demonstrating real credibility and infrastructure. As part of its ongoing commitment to security and transparency Mutuum Finance has launched its official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK with $50,000 USDT allocated for rewards. The bounty is divided into four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low, ensuring that every level of vulnerability has a corresponding reward. This move reinforces Mutuum‚Äôs proactive stance on safety and its dedication to building a trustworthy financial ecosystem. As markets stabilize Ethereum (ETH) holds strong but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 MUTM has raised $11.2M+ from over 12,500 investors. A 16.67% price jump is coming in Phase 6. Backed by a CertiK audit a $100K giveaway and a $50K bug bounty, MUTM is a top DeFi pick for 2025. Buy now before the next price hike.

The price today sits near $2. That means a 10,000√ó jump from current levels. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role According to reports, the idea first took shape in 2022, when game developer and XRP backer Chad Steingraber laid out a plan that leaned on big banks and tokenized assets. Now, that bold forecast has resurfaced on social platform X, sparking fresh talk about where this digital token might head next. ‚ÄúThe Chad Steingraber Theory‚Äù ‚Äì The Road to a $20K #XRP A Threadüßµfrom The Future‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to tell you a story and I‚Äôll spin it so that all you need is an interest to learn what‚Äôs in store for all of us. Grab a drink, grab a snack and let‚Äôs take a ride, shall we? ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) August 18, 2022 Rise Of Tokenized Assets According to Steingraber, the first step involves issuing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies on the XRP Ledger. Every time a new token launches there, it would need XRP to settle transactions. That could push up daily demand. Today, only a handful of tokens sit on the XRP chain, but he sees that growing into the hundreds. If even 100 new coins adopt XRP settlements, demand could climb by billions of dollars each year. It consists of three components: 1 ‚Äì Assets built on the XRP Ledger (Stablecoins are the ‚Äúutility‚Äù) 2 ‚Äì XRP becomes a reserve asset to power the utility 3 ‚Äì XRP is removed from public supply by institutions This is how IT WILL. üòâ https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 28, 2025 Banks Holding XRP As Gold Based on reports, the second driver is banks treating XRP like a reserve asset. Instead of just trading it on public exchanges, financial firms would stash XRP in private ledgers to back their own digital currencies. He points to ‚Äúmany institutions‚Äù that have already floated plans to include XRP in their reserve piles. If each of those firms holds hundreds of millions of dollars in XRP, it could remove a large chunk of supply from open markets. Institutional Absorption Of Supply Here‚Äôs where the math gets eye‚Äëpopping. XRP‚Äôs total supply is capped at 100 billion. But Steingraber says roughly 20‚ÄØbillion tokens remain in public hands after accounting for locks, burns, and lost keys. If big institutions lock away most of that, circulation could shrink to under 100‚ÄØmillion. That would set the stage for a classic supply shock. He even predicts prices could surge from cents to thousands of dollars within hours once companies dive in. Regulatory And Competition Hurdles Despite the excitement, there are clear roadblocks. XRP is still fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court. A final loss could stall deals or scare off banks. At the same time, rival chains like Ethereum and Solana also host tokenized assets. Those networks already see billions in daily volume. XRP would need to prove it offers something stronger or faster to win over big players. Related Reading: The $100K Mirage: Bitcoin‚Äôs Rally Not Backed By On-Chain Strength A Long Shot With Big Ifs This forecast hinges on three big ‚Äúifs‚Äù: strong tokenization growth, banks stacking XRP as reserves, and a real supply squeeze on public markets. If any one of those doesn‚Äôt materialize, the $20,000 mark drifts further away. Still, it makes for a gripping story. For now, XRP traders will watch legal filings and ledger activity with fresh eyes, wondering if this bold theory has any chance of coming true.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading Solana's Rise: Is SOL the Next Big Thing in Crypto? Launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana has quickly become a key player in the blockchain world. Aimed at solving scalability issues, it can handle over 50,000 transactions per second with minimal fees. This impressive speed has drawn significant attention from developers and investors alike. Solana's unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism, combined with proof-of-stake, enables fast and efficient transaction processing. Its ability to interoperate with other blockchains through bridges enhances its functionality and appeal in the decentralized finance ecosystem. By 2025, Solana's native token, SOL, has experienced substantial growth. Its price has surged over the years, reflecting strong technological foundations and increasing adoption. This upward trend highlights its potential in the competitive crypto market. In the current market cycle, Solana's speed and scalability make it particularly attractive. Its innovative features have positioned it as a strong contender among smart contract platforms, appealing to those seeking robust and efficient blockchain solutions. Looking ahead, Solana's future seems promising. Ongoing technological advancements and a growing ecosystem may further solidify its status in the crypto space. However, as with all investments, market dynamics can change, and it's important to stay informed. Ripple's XRP in 2025: A Crypto Contender with Growing Potential Ripple's XRP is renowned for its fast and low-cost transactions. As a decentralized network, it enables quick cross-border payments for both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. With a unique consensus protocol and the capacity to handle 1,500 transactions per second, XRP appeals to financial services seeking efficient solutions. XRP's price history has been volatile. It rose from under a cent in 2013 to an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. Legal challenges, particularly with the SEC, have caused declines. However, favorable rulings have often boosted its price, reflecting investor confidence in its potential. In 2025, XRP appears promising. Partnerships with banks and financial institutions indicate growing adoption. Ripple's emphasis on speeding up and securing money transfers sets XRP apart from competitors like Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially in the global payments arena. Experts predict growth for XRP. Some foresee it reaching up to $15.65 by 2030, driven by collaborations with banks and wider use of Ripple's payment solutions. Even conservative estimates anticipate significant gains over time. While exact price movements are uncertain, XRP's technological strengths and strategic partnerships suggest a bright future. Staying informed about Ripple's developments and regulatory news is crucial. As XRP expands its role in the financial sector, it remains a cryptocurrency to watch. Render (RNDR): Decentralizing GPU Power for the AI Revolution Render (RNDR) is changing how we access GPU computing. Started in 2017, it decentralizes GPU services using blockchain. People contribute unused GPU power and earn RNDR tokens. Those needing GPU services pay with RNDR to tap into this shared network. Render creates a distributed GPU marketplace. With AI technologies booming, GPU demand is soaring. GPUs are essential for AI development, and Render meets this need through its decentralized platform. Traditional GPU services are expensive. Render's network offers more affordable access to GPU resources. This opens high-end computing to projects that couldn't afford it before, leveling the playing field. RNDR has seen significant growth in past markets, surging from under $0.50 to over $7.47. As a leader in decentralized GPU services, Render attracts attention in a growing market. Analysts suggest RNDR could surpass previous highs due to rising AI and GPU demands. While future prices are uncertain, Render's innovative approach positions it well for potential growth. Fetch.ai (FET): The AI-Blockchain Fusion Transforming Industries Fetch.ai, founded in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh and Toby Simpson, is reshaping the digital landscape. Combining artificial intelligence and blockchain, it aims to create a decentralized world where smart contracts interact with reality. Their Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs) perform tasks for individuals and organizations, like managing supply chains or personalizing services. Fetch.ai's technology enhances interoperability between systems. By using AI-driven agents and a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it ensures scalability and energy efficiency.

This collaboration merges their tokens, AGIX and OCEAN, into FET, creating a unified ecosystem for decentralized AI technologies. This alliance amplifies resources and expertise, aiming to advance AI applications that are safe and beneficial for society. Historically, FET's price movement reflects its growing impact. From hovering around $1 since inception, it saw a surge to $3 in early 2024, possibly due to increased adoption of AI and blockchain technologies. As of 2025, it's at its all-time high, signaling strong market confidence. Long-term predictions suggest that FET could continue its upward trajectory. Some analysts speculate prices reaching $10 or even higher, considering the rapid integration of AI in industries. While exact figures are uncertain, Fetch.ai's innovative approach positions it attractively in the evolving market cycle. Conclusion While established coins like SOL and XRP have shown promise, their short-term potential seems limited. Similarly, alternatives like RENDER and FET may not offer significant gains in the immediate future.

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals From Meme to Mainstream: Dogecoin's Journey and Potential Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the ""Doge"" meme. Created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun and friendly alternative to Bitcoin. It quickly gained a loyal following because it didn't take itself too seriously. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin has some interesting features. It uses a technology similar to Litecoin, which allows for faster transactions. There's no cap on the number of coins that can be created, so the supply keeps growing. This abundance makes it different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Dogecoin's price has been a rollercoaster. In 2021, it soared to an all-time high of $0.7376, fueled by social media buzz and celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk. Since then, it has faced ups and downs but remains popular among its passionate community. In the market cycle of 2025, Dogecoin continues to attract attention. Its strong fan base and increasing adoption suggest potential. However, it faces competition from other cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Litecoin. Whether it looks attractive now depends on how these factors play out. Looking ahead, some experts have made predictions about Dogecoin's future. For example, CoinCodex projected that Dogecoin could reach around $1.36 by April 2025. Others suggest more modest growth, highlighting the uncertainty in the crypto world. Future prices are always guesses and depend on many factors. Shiba Inu's Journey: Can the Meme Coin Turn into a Long-Term Investment? Shiba Inu, known as SHIB, began its adventure in 2020 as a fun and light-hearted cryptocurrency. It was inspired by Dogecoin and aimed to ride the hype of meme coins. At first, SHIB was just a simple token that people could send to each other or hold as an investment. But something unexpected happened‚Äîit caught the attention of big names like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin. This attention helped SHIB rise quickly in popularity. Seeing the growing interest, the creators of SHIB decided to expand its horizons. They launched their own decentralized exchange and started a project involving unique digital art pieces called NFTs. These additions made SHIB more than just a joke coin. It attracted even more users and helped set it apart from other meme coins that didn't offer much beyond a good laugh. By 2021, SHIB had reached an all-time high in price. Although it later dropped and settled into a lower range, the community didn't lose hope. Over the next few years, from 2022 to 2025, SHIB's price hovered between $0.00001 and $0.00002. During this time, the team kept building new projects like a metaverse, games, a magazine, and merchandise. These ventures showed that SHIB was serious about growing and not just relying on its meme status. As of 2025, SHIB has built a strong foundation with its various projects. This groundwork could help the coin grow if more people enter the crypto world or if there's another surge in the market. Some experts believe that SHIB has the potential to rise again, especially if it continues to develop and attract new users. Its active community and ongoing efforts make it a coin worth watching. Looking ahead, predictions made in earlier years suggested that SHIB could gradually increase in value. While no one can say for sure what will happen, these forecasts show that there is optimism about SHIB's future. If the coin keeps evolving and adding useful features, it might just turn from a meme into a mainstream cryptocurrency. Only time will tell if SHIB can reach new heights, but its journey so far has been anything but dull. From Meme to Market: The Rise of PEPE Coin In the early 2000s, Matt Furie's cartoon frog became an internet sensation known as ""Pepe the Frog."" This simple meme has now leaped into the cryptocurrency world as PEPE Coin. Embracing its fun origins, PEPE Coin is a deflationary token built on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. PEPE Coin stands out for its simplicity, transparency, and strong community. The project's goals are straightforward: Phase 1 is Meme, Phase 2 is Vibe and HODL, and Phase 3 is Meme Takeover. By staying true to its roots, PEPE keeps things light-hearted and engaging for its supporters. In December 2024, PEPE Coin reached an all-time high of $0.00002825. After this peak, the price dropped by about 68%, likely due to early investors taking profits. This volatility is common with meme coins but also presents opportunities for new investors looking to join the community. Looking ahead, some analysts believe PEPE Coin has the potential to rise. Predictions for 2025 suggest prices could range from $0.000014 to as high as $0.0027. By 2030, forecasts see possible prices between $0.00003015 and $0.0182, reflecting optimism about the coin's long-term prospects. As of 2025, PEPE Coin is a prominent player among meme coins, alongside Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its strong community and simple approach make it appealing in the current market cycle. For those embracing the fun side of crypto, PEPE Coin offers an intriguing opportunity with the potential for significant growth. Conclusion As the meme coin landscape shifts, established tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are seeing their short-term potential diminish. Market attention is now gravitating towards newcomers such as PEPE and AGNT, which are injecting fresh energy and innovation into the scene. These emerging tokens are capturing interest by offering unique features that set them apart from their predecessors. Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by harnessing genuine artificial intelligence to maximize trading profits. Unlike others that merely tout AI capabilities, this token provides tangible tools like AI-driven market predictions and fully automated trading systems.

The Emergence of PEPE and AGNT as Crypto Contenders The cryptocurrency market is witnessing the ascent of new players, PEPE and AGNT, which are beginning to overshadow the once dominant DOGE and SHIB.

While DOGE and SHIB once stood at the pinnacle of the meme coin market, their novelty is being challenged by innovative new entries like PEPE and AGNT. These newcomers are not only capturing the market's imagination but are also backed by technologically advanced features that promise more than just viral content. Current Market Dynamics DOGE and SHIB are witnessing a gradual decline in dominance as more dynamic and technically equipped coins come to the forefront. The market‚Äôs growing sophistication demands more from meme coins than what the pioneering tokens currently offer. In contrast, PEPE and AGNT are not simply resting on the laurels of meme culture; they leverage it with robust technological backing to offer tangible benefits and utility. Conclusion: A New Era for Meme Coins The entry of PEPE and AGNT marks a significant shift in the meme cryptocurrency landscape. By blending popular culture with serious technological innovation, these coins are setting up to possibly outshine their predecessors and make a lasting impact on the crypto market.

Amid a bull run, speculators are eyeing this $2 million project. The coin, known in crypto circles as Codename:Pepe, is introducing a unique blend of humor and high-tech features. Codename:Pepe aims to stand out in the meme coin jungle, promising substantial gains. Inspired by successes like PEPE's iconic rise, this project seeks community backing to soar. Offering AI-powered trading tools and exclusive benefits, it draws investors into its secretive, engaging ecosystem. Will it capture DOGE-like momentum? Enthusiasts are eager to watch its journey unfold. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, two of the most prominent trends today. Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal‚Äîmany simply use ""AI"" as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility, while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly¬†crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project‚Äôs AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices. The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today‚Äôs crypto market: AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project‚Äôs focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing ‚Äì Join the Mission Now! From Meme to Mainstream: Dogecoin's Journey and Potential Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the ""Doge"" meme. Created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun and friendly alternative to Bitcoin. It quickly gained a loyal following because it didn't take itself too seriously. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin has some interesting features. It uses a technology similar to Litecoin, which allows for faster transactions. There's no cap on the number of coins that can be created, so the supply keeps growing. This abundance makes it different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Dogecoin's price has been a rollercoaster. In 2021, it soared to an all-time high of $0.7376, fueled by social media buzz and celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk. Since then, it has faced ups and downs but remains popular among its passionate community. In the market cycle of 2025, Dogecoin continues to attract attention. Its strong fan base and increasing adoption suggest potential. However, it faces competition from other cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Litecoin. Whether it looks attractive now depends on how these factors play out. Looking ahead, some experts have made predictions about Dogecoin's future. For example, CoinCodex projected that Dogecoin could reach around $1.36 by April 2025. Others suggest more modest growth, highlighting the uncertainty in the crypto world. Future prices are always guesses and depend on many factors. Conclusion In the current bullish market, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a strong contender with significant short-term potential. Unlike established coins such as DOGE and SHIB, which may offer less immediate upside, Codename:Pepe crypto harnesses true artificial intelligence to maximize profits. By providing AI-driven trading signals and automated trading capabilities, it equips investors with tools to navigate the volatile meme coin market effectively. With its community-first approach and innovative use of AI, Codename:Pepe crypto is poised to make a substantial impact. Its focus on delivering real value to its holders sets it apart from other coins. As momentum builds, Codename:Pepe crypto could indeed be the next breakout success, offering opportunities for significant gains to those who join its mission.

Speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Alex Gladstein, HRF‚Äôs chief strategy officer, emphasized BTC‚Äôs role in protecting citizens against oppressive regimes. ‚ÄúWith Bitcoin, the ability of these leaders to do these things is completely decimated,‚Äù Gladstein said, describing BTC as ‚Äúbad for dictators.‚Äù Bitcoin Shields Individuals From Hyperinflation Addressing what he described as a ‚Äúhall full of American leaders,‚Äù Gladstein explained that Bitcoin, when used correctly and without linking to personal identities, becomes much harder for governments to track. This makes it difficult for authorities to freeze or seize funds, a common tactic used by authoritarian regimes to control their populations. Gladstein emphasized that those who self-custody their BTC are shielded from tactics often used by dictators, including asset freezes and hyperinflation. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can‚Äôt delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can‚Äôt hyperinflate you,‚Äù he stated, underlining BTC‚Äôs value as a hedge during periods of hyperinflation and economic instability . He added that BTC has already helped many people in countries facing authoritarian control, describing it as a technology that has ‚Äúsaved or rescued‚Äù lives by providing financial freedom. Ukraine‚Äôs Pro-Democracy Movement Gladstein recounted how the HRF first recognized BTC‚Äôs potential during Ukraine‚Äôs 2013 pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Many activists involved in the demonstrations, which would later evolve into the Maidan Square movement, faced frozen bank accounts as they organized for democratic reforms. ‚ÄúThis was very early in Bitcoin‚Äôs life cycle; Bitcoin was worth like a hundred bucks at the time; we were very skeptical that this would work,‚Äù Gladstein said, reflecting on HRF‚Äôs cautious yet open-minded approach to using BTC. Despite uncertainties, the HRF proceeded with Bitcoin , successfully delivering funds to activists when traditional financial channels were blocked. ‚ÄúIt got the value to them where traditional money couldn‚Äôt go,‚Äù Gladstein noted. Since joining HRF in 2007, he has focused on advancing human rights globally, particularly in regions under authoritarian rule, positioning BTC as a vital tool for protecting financial freedom.

Solana's unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism, combined with proof-of-stake, enables fast and efficient transaction processing. Its ability to interoperate with other blockchains through bridges enhances its functionality and appeal in the decentralized finance ecosystem. By 2025, Solana's native token, SOL, has experienced substantial growth. Its price has surged over the years, reflecting strong technological foundations and increasing adoption. This upward trend highlights its potential in the competitive crypto market. In the current market cycle, Solana's speed and scalability make it particularly attractive. Its innovative features have positioned it as a strong contender among smart contract platforms, appealing to those seeking robust and efficient blockchain solutions. Looking ahead, Solana's future seems promising. Ongoing technological advancements and a growing ecosystem may further solidify its status in the crypto space. However, as with all investments, market dynamics can change, and it's important to stay informed.

This breaking news has uplifted the XRP price by more than 5% due to increased interest from retail and institutional investors alike. This news comes one day after a US district court denied a joint request from Ripple and the SEC. The motion sought to reduce the $125 million civil penalty and reverse a previous order regarding XRP sales. By ending the appeal, Ripple shows confidence in its business model and regulatory position. If the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict and offer clarity for other crypto firms facing SEC scrutiny. Now, many industry experts expect a clear path for a U.S. spot XRP ETF. They speculate that BlackRock may lead the way, especially after Ripple dropped its appeal against the SEC.

Now, the odds are more than ever for XRP ETF to be approved. Meanwhile, Bloomberg analysts last week raised the XRP ETF approval odds to 95%, and polymarket sees a 78% chance by the year-end. The expectations are running wild, with many even betting that BlackRock would be the most likely player to take the lead, but BlackRock hasn‚Äôt confirmed anything yet. Closed chapter on this clears way for spot XRP ETF‚Ä¶ Also clears way for BlackRock to jump in. https://t.co/t3f8ycOeEx ‚Äî Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 28, 2025 The hopes are high because legal clarity would allow other big players to feel confident enough to explore launching an XRP-backed ETF. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù476470‚Ä≥] If this is approved, adoption would rise, boosting the XRP price higher too. Yet, Ripple‚Äôs CTO, David Schwartz, recently commented that real adoption could rise if cross-chain interoperability in the XRP ecosystem is introduced. And this week‚Äôs Wormhole announcement is a clear indication that they are headed that road. Analyst Hints $10 in XRP Price The XRP price has continued its downtrend within a falling channel, dropping over 35% from its Q1 peak, resulting in a bearish first half. Despite this, XRP is maintaining a strong support area in Q2 and is consolidating near the channel‚Äôs upper boundary. While the H1 price action might appear bearish, but rising bullish sentiment, increased on-chain activity, major integrations, and recent legal clarity suggest a potential breakout ahead. If the legal battle surrounding XRP concludes favorably, a breakout could target the Q1 high of approximately $3.39, with the possibility of even higher targets. Even analyst opinions like Captain Redbeard also align with optimistic forecasts. The analyst highlights that if XRP price advances, then a major bounce from the current demand zone could push a rise to $10.

Ripple is not formally ‚Äúsettling‚Äù in the traditional sense, as a proposed settlement was rejected. However, Ripple has withdrawn its cross-appeal and accepted the court‚Äôs $125 million penalty. The lawsuit is effectively ending as the SEC is also expected to withdraw its appeal. How high will XRP go after the lawsuit officially concludes? Analysts are highly optimistic for XRP post-lawsuit. Short-term targets range from $3.00-$3.59, with 12-month potential between $5.00-$8.00, especially with a likely spot XRP ETF approval. Some even project targets as high as $10-$15 in this cycle. How would a spot XRP ETF affect XRP‚Äôs price, adoption, and overall market sentiment? A spot XRP ETF would likely boost XRP‚Äôs price significantly by unlocking billions in institutional capital. It would dramatically enhance liquidity, legitimize XRP as a mainstream investment, and shift overall market sentiment to be overwhelmingly positive due to increased accessibility and regulatory clarity. Will this legal clarity encourage more institutional investment and product development in the U.S. crypto market? Yes, the legal clarity from the Ripple case is expected to significantly encourage more institutional investment and product development in the U.S. crypto market.

Here is a concise round-up of the most important developments shaping the digital asset landscape brought to you by Outset PR, a crypto-native PR firm that pioneers a new niche of public relations through a data-driven approach. BlackRock Eyes Broader Crypto ETF Horizons BlackRock Inc., the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, is weighing an expansion of its crypto ETF lineup beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm is evaluating funds tied to Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT) and Solana (SOL), in a move that would mark a significant shift toward broader digital asset exposure. The deliberations come amid rising institutional appetite for tokenized assets and decentralized network infrastructure. While no formal product has been announced, industry analysts say such offerings could boost liquidity and legitimize second-tier cryptocurrencies in the eyes of traditional investors. The move echoes BlackRock‚Äôs broader strategy to deepen its presence in the digital finance sector, following its successful Bitcoin ETF rollout earlier this year. Crypto Investment Products See $1.24 Billion in Weekly Inflows Digital asset investment vehicles attracted $1.24 billion in net inflows last week, led by continued demand for Bitcoin ETFs. The data, released by CoinShares , suggests that institutional investors remain net buyers despite heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin accounted for the bulk of inflows, reaffirming its status as the sector‚Äôs bellwether. Analysts view the capital movement as a signal of confidence in the long-term viability of crypto assets, particularly among firms seeking inflation hedges and portfolio diversification. The figures mark one of the strongest weekly showings for crypto funds in 2025, underscoring a renewed sense of risk-on sentiment among large capital allocators. Bolivia‚Äôs Crypto Transactions Surge 530% Amid Currency Woes In a sign of rising grassroots adoption, Bolivia recorded a 530% increase in cryptocurrency transactions, according to new data from regional exchanges and blockchain analytics firms. The surge comes as the country struggles with inflationary pressures, currency controls, and limited access to formal banking services. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and stablecoins are increasingly being used for remittances, savings, and peer-to-peer commerce, particularly among urban youth and small businesses. The trend reflects a broader shift in emerging markets, where digital assets are gaining traction as financial lifelines. Bolivia‚Äôs rapid adoption mirrors similar patterns seen in Argentina, Venezuela and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Outset PR‚Äôs Proprietary Techniques Deliver Tangible Results As digital assets evolve from speculation to real value, so must the way crypto firms tell their stories. Outset PR , a specialized Web3 communications agency, is reshaping how PR is executed in this sector by turning media visibility into verifiable growth. Outset PR replaces vague promises with performance-driven planning, leveraging retrospective data and real-time metrics to time publications, tailor narratives, and calibrate campaign outreach to business outcomes. Clients know exactly where their story will land, when it will break, and what results to expect. Unlike mass-blast agencies, Outset delivers PR strategies customized for each client‚Äôs growth stage, budget, and market focus. The secret lies in its proprietary traffic acquisition stack, which fuses organic editorial coverage with SEO-optimized, lead-generating distribution. The firm‚Äôs in-house analytics desk monitors crypto media performance across factors like domain activity, audience geography, and visibility trends providing actionable insights that fuel smarter outreach. Bottom Line Institutional and retail crypto adoption are advancing in parallel. While asset managers like BlackRock explore deeper forays into alternative tokens, individuals in unstable economies are accelerating real-world usage. With capital flows returning to the sector and geopolitical conditions driving demand, crypto‚Äôs utility story may soon rival its investment narrative. And as the stakes rise, so does the need for sharper communication. Outset PR‚Äôs integrated approach‚Äîblending storytelling with traffic acquisition and market intel‚Äîgives Web3 companies a powerful lens through which to define their public presence.

Specifically, there is a notable buildup of short positions near $119,000 across exchanges like Bybit, OKX, and Binance. If Bitcoin continues its upward move, as much as $1.4 billion in shorts could be liquidated, triggering a potential short squeeze, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Coinglass on June 29. Bitcoin exchange liquidation map. Source: Coinglass The liquidation map shows rising short leverage even as long exposure declines, signaling imbalance. Therefore, a breakout above $110,000 could act as a catalyst, forcing shorts to cover and pushing prices higher. It‚Äôs worth noting that Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally has been fueled in part by easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. To this end, analysts suggest that the rebound may lead to a new all-time high, potentially in the coming week if momentum holds. Bitcoin signals more bullish momentum Adding to the bullish setup, analyst Ali Martinez noted in an X post on June 28 that Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is nearing a golden cross with its 30-day simple moving average ( SMA ).

Notably, the MVRV Ratio measures how over- or undervalued Bitcoin is relative to holders‚Äô cost basis. A crossover above the 30-day SMA typically indicates strengthening sentiment and inflow of capital. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was valued at $108,190, up 0.8% in 24 hours and 2.4% on the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Bitcoin is trading above its 50-day SMA of $105,901, while the 200-day SMA at $87,663 confirms a strong long-term uptrend. The 14-day RSI stands at 55.89, indicating a neutral but supportive stance for continued upside.

Metaplanet Inc. is one of the leading names among the institutional investors in BTC. The company, which is tagged Asia‚Äôs Microstrategy, is currently the 7th largest BTC holder after its recent purchase of 1,234 BTC for $132.7 million. However, while institutional investors are stashing BTC, retail investors are more interested in a new Ethereum-based token called Remittix . The Remittix presale has been moving so fast, reaching over $15.8 million in total raise within a few months. Let‚Äôs find out why some people call RTX the new Ripple (XRP) despite being in its early days. Remittix remains the talk of the town during presale The Remittix presale is one of the biggest news stories in the crypto market recently. Since the presale began some months ago, it has moved at an unprecedented speed, reaching a total raise of nearly $16 million in no time. The early presale success reflects investors‚Äô strong interest in Remittix, especially as top cryptocurrencies like BTC and XRP have been moving sideways in recent weeks. For Remittix, the broader crypto sentiment has only caused more attention. More investors are diversifying their portfolios with the new altcoin and the earliest adopters have already made about 500x gains. Regarding its long-term possibilities, experts have predicted that Remittix could do 1,000% gains or more in 2025, especially after the project kicks off officially and the RTX token gets listed on reputable crypto exchanges. Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional investors remain unfazed Despite the lingering bearish trend in the crypto market, the BTC price has maintained an average price of around $106K over the past month. Even the massive dip from the global tensions could not hold the BTC price from moving back to the green zone. The doggedness seen in the BTC price movement is largely a result of the continuous purchase of Bitcoin by institutions. Companies like Strategy, Fidelity Investments and Metaplanet are accumulating BTC in massive numbers, with Metaplanet now edging Tesla in the top 10 Bitcoin holder list after its latest purchase. Source: CoinMarketCap Evidently, institutions are unfazed by the happenings in the broader crypto market, but for retail investors, the 3% increase in the BTC price over the past week is somewhat low. RTX could outshine BTC and XRP in 2025 Due to the slow upward movement in the BTC price, more retail investors are turning to altcoins like XRP for portfolio diversification. The interest in XRP stems from its big status in the crypto payment space, as businesses and individuals now leverage XRP for superfast cross-border payments at extremely low costs. Source: CoinMarketCap However, the XRP price shows similar slow growth to BTC. For context, XRP has been stuck around $2 for the past few months. Conversely, RTX is soaring and is now believed to be poised for the biggest gains compared to BTC and XRP in 2025. The massive jump in the RTX price would be fueled by its demand by businesses using the Remittix Pay API to process cross-border payments for their products and services. Plus, individuals sending money worldwide will also need RTX to spread love to their friends and families who can get the payment directly in their bank accounts and convert to 30+ fiat currencies in one place. Conclusion With Remittix‚Äôs promising outlook, now is the best time to buy RTX at $0.0781 before it reaches its $18 million soft cap value and explodes.

Both are now approaching key resistance levels that could determine whether a summer breakout is possible. While broader market momentum remains mixed, technical indicators suggest there may be enough room for upside if volume and sentiment return. This technical outlook is brought to you by the team at Outset PR , where trend data meets strategic storytelling. This crypto-native PR agency positions crypto projects at the intersection of media visibility and market timing. Cardano (ADA) Faces Challenging Market with Potential Upside Source: tradingview Cardano's price sits between forty-eight and sixty-three cents, facing pressure after a near eight percent drop in a week. Currently, the closest hurdle for ADA is seventy-two cents. If ADA manages to break this barrier, it could reach eighty-six cents, growing over thirty percent from the low end of its present range. Still, it is riding below key moving averages, and its RSI suggests it isn't in overbought territory, hinting at a possible upside. The one-month and six-month declines of nearly twenty-seven percent and thirty-eight percent indicate struggles, yet for optimists, the right push could see ADA climbing back to stronger levels.

For crypto, blockchain, or AI enterprises that need clarity and velocity‚Äîthis is what PR should feel like. XRP Price Shows Potential for a Strong Rebound Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $1.84 and $2.27, showing a slight dip but potential for rebound. The coin faces its nearest resistance at around $2.52, which might be a challenge. However, if it breaks through, XRP could aim for higher levels near $2.95. This would be an increase of about 30% from its current high point. On the support side, $1.66 acts as protective ground against further fall. The Relative Strength Index at about 38 suggests it's not overbought, hinting there's room for upward movement. Despite mixed signals, XRP's path forward looks hopeful as it also hovers close to its moving averages, which may support a bullish shift. Conclusion As ADA and XRP hover near critical resistance zones, the coming weeks could be pivotal. A successful breakout might pave the way for renewed optimism‚Äîand even talk of new all-time highs‚Äîif macro sentiment aligns. Yet caution remains warranted, as both coins still face structural overhead and recent bearish pressure. Outset PR turns moments like these into strategic visibility for crypto and blockchain brands. With performance-driven campaigns they build narratives that fit the market context and reach the target audience to provide the needed results.

On the occasion of Pi2day, Pi Network has officially partnered with Banxa and Onramper , two well-known fiat-to-crypto platforms that help users buy and sell crypto using traditional money like dollars, euros, and rupees. For everyday Pi users, this means it just got easier to convert Pi Coins into fiat‚Äîand vice versa, without needing to go through complicated crypto exchanges. Turning Pi Into Real Money With this partnership, Pi users can now buy Pi Coins using local currency through popular payment options like credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank transfers. No more jumping through hoops or needing to understand complicated crypto exchanges, it‚Äôs now as simple as shopping online. Even better, users can also sell Pi for cash directly into their bank accounts. That‚Äôs a game-changer for people who‚Äôve been holding Pi for years but had no clear way to cash out. Why Banxa‚Äôs Role Is Huge Banxa is doing more than just offering buy/sell services. They‚Äôve already purchased over 30.5 million Pi tokens, worth nearly $19 million, to make sure there‚Äôs enough supply for trading. This means users won‚Äôt have to wait days for their orders to go through ‚Äî transactions can now be smoother and faster. Banxa is also helping new users open Pi wallets by handling KYC (Know Your Customer) checks, even if they haven‚Äôt passed Pi‚Äôs internal KYC yet. That lowers the barrier for more people to start using Pi. Onramper: More Options for Pi Buyers Onramper works a bit differently. It brings together multiple fiat-to-crypto providers‚Äîlike Banxa and others‚Äîso Pi Network users can choose from different payment methods and currencies, all in one place. While not as deeply integrated as Banxa, Onramper still makes Pi Coin more reachable, especially in regions where Banxa might not be available. No Surge In Pi Coin Despite all the recent buzz, Pi Coin‚Äôs price is still stuck in the red zone. Over the last few days, Pi Coin has dropped 3.6%, falling from $0.57 to about $0.5356. Adding to the worry is the huge unlocking of Pi tokens coming up in July. Nearly 337 million new Pi tokens will join the circulating supply next month. With low demand, this could push the price down to around $0.40 soon.",News,EN,0,0,FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-29 12:18:23

HYPE and Cardano (ADA) are both showing signs of bearish continuation, with chart patterns and technical signals leaning toward further downside. While long-term optimism remains for some investors, current setups demand caution and close monitoring. This update is brought to you by Outset PR ‚Äî the data-driven crypto PR agency that translates technical insights into compelling narratives. From market trend shifts to investor sentiment pivots, Outset PR helps crypto projects navigate volatility with strategy and precision. HYPE's Volatile Ride: Can It Reach New Highs? Source: tradingview Hyperliquid's current value is hovering between the mid-$29s and mid-$44s. It shows signs of potential growth, with a recent six-month increase of over 26%. If it breaks past the nearest resistance at just over $52, it could target the next level at around $67. This would mean a rise of over 50% from its current low. The coin's price movements are mixed with a promising outlook, given positive shifts over the past week and month. While short-term signals show indecision, the long-term trend remains hopeful. With proper momentum, HYPE could make significant gains in the coming months.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets.

Conclusion With HYPE and ADA facing mounting technical resistance and continued drawdowns, the near-term outlook is skewed to the downside. Unless sentiment reverses or new catalysts emerge, these altcoins may remain under pressure in the weeks ahead. Investors should remain selective and lean on data for directional cues.

Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano each present bullish technical setups, with potential upside ranging from 30% to 35%‚Äîpositioning them as serious contenders to outpace even the strongest equities in 2025. As investor focus shifts from overvalued tech to innovative infrastructure, blockchain may offer the edge. This performance-driven outlook is powered by Outset PR ‚Äîwhere crypto communication is grounded in data, trend signals, and market relevance. Outset PR helps crypto leaders turn moments of opportunity into lasting visibility and growth. Ethereum Shows Stable Path with Room for Growth Source: tradingview Ethereum currently sees prices ranging between two thousand and a bit over twenty-five hundred dollars. It's facing its first test at the potential climb of nearly three thousand dollars. Below, its safety net lies just above seventeen hundred. Looking back over half a year, the value has dipped close to thirty percent. However, with a mid-range RSI and a higher Stochastic, there appears to be momentum. If Ethereum breaks past its immediate ceiling, it might aim for the highs of three thousand four hundred. From its current state, this marks a promising leap, suggesting growth potential of about thirty-five percent, offering hope for bullish investors. Solana (SOL): Undervalued Titan with 30%+ Breakout Potential Source: tradingview Solana may have danced through recent volatility, but its long-term appeal remains intact. Trading between $119 and $152, SOL is approaching a key resistance at $171‚Äîan area that, once cleared, could send the price soaring to $204. That‚Äôs a potential gain of more than 30%, making Solana a strong candidate to outpace many tech stocks this year. With firm support near $107 and increasing attention from institutional players, Solana's current levels could present an attractive entry point before the next wave up.

For crypto, blockchain, or AI enterprises that need clarity and velocity‚Äîthis is what PR should feel like. Cardano (ADA): Quietly Building Momentum for a Major Rally Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) may be flying under the radar, but its technicals suggest a brewing breakout. Holding steady between $0.48 and $0.63, ADA is nearing a pivotal resistance at $0.72. A successful breach could catapult it toward $0.86‚Äîover 30% higher than its recent low. Despite short-term dips, ADA‚Äôs RSI shows room to grow, and its undervalued position against moving averages makes it a compelling blockchain bet. For long-term believers, ADA remains one of the most promising projects that could outperform traditional equities as 2025 unfolds. Conclusion Ethereum‚Äôs consistent structure, Solana‚Äôs breakout potential, and Cardano‚Äôs undervalued positioning all signal that 2025 could belong to blockchain but not Big Tech. With smart money watching support zones and resistance levels closely, these projects stand poised to deliver returns that rival or surpass traditional markets. Outset PR turns this kind of market intelligence into strategic messaging for Web3 brands. From bullish narratives to tier-1 visibility, Outset PR crafts campaigns that ride momentum.

According to the report, 31% of crypto ownership is held by investors in their 40s, 28% in their 30s, and 25% by persons in their 50s, narrowing the age gap between crypto ownership to 22%. Most investors between 50 and 59, 78%, said they invest in crypto as a means of wealth accumulation on their side, and 53% are using it to save towards retirement. The interest is not diminishing either, as 70% of all respondents wanted to invest more in crypto. Traditional financial institutions ‚Äò role and more robust legal protection were cited as having a role in raising confidence. Current crypto users are dominated by white-collar men in their 30s and 40s. The report , however, states that trading strategies are maturing. Frequent crypto purchases increased by 34% and medium-term activity increased by 47%. Short-term speculative trading marginally fell. Bitcoin leads, but users begin diversifying holdings Bitcoin is still the most popular, as six out of ten investors own BTC . However, with increased experience, most are venturing into altcoins and stablecoins. NFTs and security tokens are still unpopular, as nine out of ten investors prefer to keep only coin investments. Banking restrictions became a major problem. Seven in ten investors said they would prefer their main bank for crypto transactions if allowed to link multiple accounts. Currently, South Korea only allows one bank account per exchange, which is very strict and limits user experience and flexibility. Youth unemployment in South Korea is currently high at 6.6%, more than double the national average. The increasing cost of housing and the overall lack of wage increases are pushing young Koreans into high-risk crypto investments. This contrasts with older investors, who increasingly appreciate crypto for conducting structured savings and long-term wealth planning. KB Kookmin Bank pushes forward with stablecoin filings Institutional action is picking up pace. Recently, South Korea-based KB Kookmin Bank submitted 17 trademarks potentially related to a future stablecoin product, including designations such as KBKRW and KRWST. Both filings were filed with the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Services and cover software for virtual currency and blockchain-based systems. These trademarks are part of the bank‚Äôs wider plans to develop a national stablecoin consortium. KB is among eight big banks planning a joint venture to issue won-pegged stablecoins . The effort is coordinated with Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute and the Open Blockchain and Decentralised Identifier Association. Such steps correspond to the political shift with President Lee Jae-myung, whose government is likely to accelerate the institutional adoption of crypto. Although crypto was not featured in his inauguration speech, the Democratic Party Digital Asset Committee plans to push regulatory reforms and integrate crypto into the financial system. Lee will be in charge of significant crypto policies in South Korea, such as the possible implementation of the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA). This move started with Yoon, who had campaigned on it but could not witness it to completion since he was relieved early. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) price rose to a high of $0.01450 on Saturday, June 28, its highest level since May 23. It has jumped by 52% from its lowest point last week and 232% above its lowest point this year. PENGU token jumped as third-party data showed that Pudgy Penguins‚Äô non-fungible token sales bounced back in the past seven days. Data compiled by CryptoSlam revealed that these sales jumped by 38% to $1.5 million. There were 68 transactions, up by 36% from the previous week. Similarly, the number of buyers and sellers rose by 48% and 32%, respectively. Pudgy Penguins ranked as the tenth most popular NFT collection in this period. It was overtaken by other collections like CryptoPunks, PGNFT, STRAT Option, and Gods Unchained. You might also like: Lista DAO price surges as total value locked hits all-time high Additional data indicates that its monthly sales decreased by 33% to $5.6 million, resulting in an all-time volume of over $636 million. PENGU price also jumped as whales and public figures bought during the recent dip, and exchange outflows rose. These public figures hold 301.7 million tokens, a 5.6% increase in the last 30 days. Whales hold 1.89 billion tokens, a 13% monthly increase, a sgn that they expect the price to keep rising. PENGU price also jumped as the supply of these tokens plunged to 14.7 billion, down from 15.6 billion on June 12. A drop in exchange reserves is bullish for an asset because it is a sign that investors are not selling their tokens. PENGU price technical analysis Pudgy Penguins price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart indicates that the PENGU price has rebounded over the past few days. This rebound happened after it formed a descending channel, which coincided with the higher highs and lower highs since May 14. It has moved above the channel‚Äôs upper side and the 25-period Exponential Moving Average. The Percentage Price Oscillator has moved above the zero line, a sign that it is gaining momentum. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $0.01742, the highest point on May 12. A drop below the support at $0.100 will invalidate the bullish forecast.

This is happening now, not next quarter, and it‚Äôs clear the traders doing it are the same ones who just months ago were falling over themselves to get a bit of the Nvidia and Microsoft apples. But things changed. That selloff earlier this year, triggered by the White House‚Äôs sudden tariff threats, sent megacap tech crashing. Nvidia, Microsoft, Broadcom‚Äîall got hammered. But just as fast, they rebounded when the fears eased. By June 27, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had both hit fresh all-time highs. But the rally wasn‚Äôt just tech. Financials, utilities, defense contractors , industrials; everyone‚Äôs eating now. Investors ditch mega-cap tech for broader bets The number of stocks in the S&P 500 closing above their 50-day moving average has surged to levels not seen since fall 2016, right before Trump got elected and markets exploded into an end-of-year rally. Even more telling, a separate metric tracking the number of stocks going up versus those going down hit a new high last Friday. Adam Turnquist, who runs technical strategy over at LPL Financial, said , ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen this before: big tech leads and the market follows. It seems like we are dusting off that playbook.‚Äù This time, though, Wall Street isn‚Äôt waiting for tech to lead. It‚Äôs moving on its own, without Nvidia dragging everything else with it. Tom Essaye from Sevens Report said the reason this is happening is simple: FOMO. ‚ÄúAs long as things can stay stable, then this market is not exhausted by any stretch of the imagination.‚Äù Tom called this the ‚ÄúFOMO trade‚Äù‚Äîthe fear of missing out that‚Äôs pushing investors into anything that isn‚Äôt priced like Tesla. Jamie Cox, who manages $1.2 billion at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, said he didn‚Äôt touch his Big Tech holdings even during the dips. Instead, he went after financials, defense, and large international stocks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised it took this long,‚Äù Jamie said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time coming.‚Äù His clients, he added, are finally asking for something besides Nvidia and Apple. ‚ÄúThat lends itself to owning different things than just the most effective of the tech stocks,‚Äù he said. His latest buys? RTX Corp and Lockheed Martin. ‚ÄúYou buy the less-aggressive, more tried-and-true, boring stocks.‚Äù Banks and small-caps catch a break as valuations stretch Still, not everyone‚Äôs celebrating. Small-caps are underperforming compared to the broader indexes. George Pearkes from Bespoke Investment Group said there‚Äôs still hesitation to touch riskier names. ‚ÄúWe would have to see a change in risk appetite.‚Äù Eric Teal, Chief Investment Officer at Comerica Wealth Management, said he‚Äôs buying across the board‚Äîmidcaps, small caps, even microcaps. His logic? These smaller names won‚Äôt get slammed by any fresh tariffs, and if the Federal Reserve cuts rates again, that could be the final push these companies need. ‚ÄúThe broadening out that we‚Äôve seen over the last number of months is not something that‚Äôs going to be short-lived,‚Äù Eric said. He‚Äôs also putting more cash into domestic banks, which are less exposed to overseas risk and trade blowback. Brian Buetel, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, said: ‚ÄúNobody disagrees that the Mag Seven are just extremely expensive.

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging through its presale, raising $11,300,000 with over 575 million tokens sold to 12,600 holders. Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5, MUTM offers a guaranteed 100% return at its $0.06 launch price. Both tokens are drawing attention in the crypto market, but which one holds the stronger potential for explosive growth? Shiba Inu‚Äôs recovery relies on market sentiment, while Mutuum Finance‚Äôs DeFi innovations promise stability. Let‚Äôs explore their outlooks, focusing on why Mutuum Finance is capturing investor enthusiasm. Shiba Inu‚Äôs tentative recovery Shiba inu is flickering life, but after an intense selling. The token fell as low as 0.00001004, the lowest since early 2023, and core parts of the crypto market tumbled. The presence of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel left SHIB to make a 16 percent rebound, hitting $0.00001162 by June 24, 2025. Bullish crossovers on technical indicators, such as the bullish crossover of the MACD, bespeak of increasing momentum. Chaikin Money Flow of +0.15 is a sign of powerful buying forces. In case the demand sustains, analysts expect the coin to rise by 17 percent to touch a new high of 0.00001362. However, volatility looms. Profit-taking or renewed market fears could push SHIB back to its recent low. Consequently, its outlook hinges on broader crypto market trends. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is racing through Phase 5, already over 50% filled. Priced at $0.03, the token has tripled from its $0.01 opening phase. Over 575 million tokens are sold, raising $11,300,000, with 12,600 holders onboard. The presale‚Äôs rapid pace signals urgency, as Phase 6 will raise the price 16.7% to $0.035. At launch, MUTM‚Äôs $0.06 listing ensures a 100% return. Analysts project a $2.50 post-launch price in 2025, offering a potential 8,233% gain. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance has launched a dashboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term commitment. This structured growth fuels investor excitement. Innovative DeFi framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in crypto investing with its dual lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts for dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability. The Peer-to-Peer model enables direct lending, ideal for volatile assets. Users retain full asset control, enhancing security. Mutuum Finance is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, reducing depegging risks. This stablecoin will streamline lending and staking, boosting liquidity. Moreover, the team finalized a CertiK audit, scoring 95.00, with no vulnerabilities found. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Bug Bounty Program, offering $50,000 in rewards, further solidifies trust. These features position Mutuum Finance as a robust DeFi platform. Rewarding community engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting excitement with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Entry requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple quests, like submitting a wallet address. This initiative rewards early supporters, amplifying interest. Additionally, Mutuum Finance‚Äôs mtToken system lets users earn interest on deposits like ETH or DAI. Staked mtTokens benefit from token buybacks, distributing profits to holders. These mechanics ensure passive income and liquidity, setting Mutuum Finance apart in the crypto investment space. Consequently, its ecosystem fosters long-term value over speculative hype, appealing to strategic investors. Choosing the stronger prospect Shiba Inu‚Äôs rally depends on crypto market stability, making it riskier. Its 17% upside pales against Mutuum Finance‚Äôs structured potential. MUTM‚Äôs presale at $0.03 offers a 100% guaranteed return at launch, with projections of $2.50 in 2025. Its DeFi innovations, CertiK-backed security, and community rewards outshine SHIB‚Äôs momentum-driven gains. For those seeking the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance‚Äôs blend of utility and growth stands unmatched. Don‚Äôt miss Phase 5‚Äôs closing window.

What About Qubetics‚Äô $10 Milestone?,https://thecoinrise.com/okb-price-prediction-2026-can-okb-reach-112-what-about-qubetics-10-milestone/,"Cryptocurrency is often unpredictable, yet methodical analysis can offer clarity on what might lie ahead for certain digital assets. OKB, a prominent utility token within one of the most active ecosystems, is drawing significant attention for its potential growth in 2026. Simultaneously, Qubetics , a rising blockchain project, is formulating a niche with its innovative AI-powered development platform. This article explores the latest OKB price prediction for 2026, dives into Qubetics‚Äô unique feature set, and outlines what analysts foresee for both projects. It provides technical and financial insights tailored for crypto enthusiasts, blockchain developers, and market analysts aiming for a comprehensive understanding. OKB Price Prediction 2026: What the Data Reveals Month by Month OKB has demonstrated steady growth over recent years, supported by its integral role in a vast crypto ecosystem. Analyzing historical price trends and projected market patterns provides a plausible range for OKB‚Äôs 2026 price. Forecasts suggest a minimum price of $94.23 by December 2026, with a maximum potential peak of $112.53. The average trading price for the year is expected to hover around $97.56, indicating a strong upward momentum. Breaking down the year, month by month, January 2026 starts conservatively with an average of $58.13, but a steady climb ensues. By mid-year, June‚Äôs average price prediction reaches $76.06, signaling a heightening demand. The upward trajectory continues through the latter half of the year, with November‚Äôs average at $93.98 and December culminating at nearly $98. This gradual increase points to a projected return on investment (ROI) of approximately 119.5% for those engaging with the token at current levels. These figures are consistent with broader market recovery trends and increased adoption of OKB‚Äôs ecosystem services. It‚Äôs important to note that such forecasts depend on several factors, including market sentiment, regulatory environments, and technological developments within the OKB ecosystem. However, buyers should keep in mind that risks remain, including typical price volatility seen across cryptocurrencies and external macroeconomic pressures. Qubetics: Seamless Blockchain Coding with AI-Powered QubeQode IDE While OKB focuses on utility within an established ecosystem, Qubetics is breaking new ground by addressing one of blockchain‚Äôs most persistent hurdles: ease of development. It features QubeQode, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that uses AI to streamline and simplify blockchain application creation. QubeQode offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface complemented by a comprehensive code snippet library. This allows developers, from novices to experts, to design smart contracts and dApps without the steep learning curve traditional coding demands. The integration of AI tools further refines this process by automatically generating optimized code, identifying bugs, and suggesting enhancements in real time. This fusion of AI and blockchain development accelerates innovation, reduces errors, and broadens accessibility to blockchain technology. Developers can focus on creative solutions rather than spending time on repetitive coding or debugging. Qubetics Crypto Presale Currently, Qubetics is in the final phase of its public presale. The project has successfully raised over $18.1 million, with more than 516 million $TICS tokens sold to over 28,2=300 holders. At a fixed price of $0.3370 per token, fewer than 9 million $TICS remain, marking this as the last opportunity to participate before the token listing. This phase reflects significant market interest and confidence in Qubetics‚Äô innovative vision, particularly among those interested in development tools that simplify blockchain adoption. Qubetics Set to Go Live with Major CEX Debut at $0.40 Qubetics is gearing up for its first major exchange listing on June 30 at 11:00 AM UTC, just three hours after its presale closes at 8:00 AM UTC. With a forecasted listing price of $0.40, early backers could see a 20% return on investment. This launch isn‚Äôt just a milestone; it‚Äôs a gateway to global markets, increased liquidity, and broader institutional adoption as Qubetics steps confidently into the next stage of its blockchain journey. Qubetics Price Prediction: What If $15,000 Was Allocated Now? If a commitment of $15,000 was made at the current $TICS price of $0.3370, the token quantity acquired would be approximately 44,529 tokens. Should $TICS reach $0.40 at listing, the initial return would represent an estimated 19.2% gain, raising the portfolio value to roughly $17,812. However, the projections become more exciting beyond the listing. At a $1 price point, the value jumps to $44,529, translating to a 196% ROI. If the token hits $5, the portfolio value would increase dramatically to $222,645, marking a 1,383% return. A further rise to $6 would represent a 1,679% gain, bringing the holding‚Äôs value close to $267,174. Long-term optimism grows with potential prices of $10 or $15, particularly after the Qubetics mainnet launch. At $10, the portfolio surges to $445,290 (2,866% ROI), while a $15 valuation would skyrocket it to nearly $667,935, marking an impressive 4,349% return. While these numbers show potential, market volatility and external risks must be acknowledged. Nonetheless, the combination of a unique AI development environment and strong crypto presale momentum places Qubetics in a position to disrupt the blockchain developer tools market. Conclusion: Balancing Established Utility With Innovation in Blockchain Development The OKB price prediction in 2026 shows promise based on steady ecosystem growth and market confidence.

Analysts from the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) ‚Äì an independent think tank organization concerned with central banking, economic policy and public investment ‚Äì say there is a global shift away from the dollar and into other currencies, primarily the euro and the renminbi. In the 2025 edition of its Global Public Investor report, which surveys 75 central banks around the world, OMFIF says there are clearly ‚Äúgrowing questions over the dollar‚Äôs dominance in portfolios and public investors are seeking safe-haven assets.‚Äù The survey notes that lately, euros have outshined dollars and among emerging markets, the renminbi has surfaced as a new favorite. ‚ÄúThe dollar is the only currency where net demand has fallen among central banks this year. This is attributable to rising concerns about the US political environment, highlighted by 70% of respondents, up from 31% last year, as well as geopolitics and US fiscal risks. The caution extends to global public funds ‚Äì more than half think that US market exceptionalism will end.‚Äù However, OMFIF notes that the dollar‚Äôs reserve currency status is not yet under threat, given that 80% of central banks surveyed said that the dollar still provides safety and liquidity, and that the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù expect the greenback to constitute over 50% of global reserves over the next decade. Rather than a rapid ‚Äúde-dollarization,‚Äù central banks are anticipating a ‚Äúgradual currency diversification,‚Äù according to the report. As to what‚Äôs driving the move away from the dollar, according to the survey, the US political environment under the Trump administration is ‚Äúdirectly leading to doubts about the dollar.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis factor was selected by 70% of respondents as a discouraging factor for investing in dollar assets, more than double from a year ago. Linked to the recent political shift is the move towards trade protection and broader geopolitical uncertainty ‚Äì which 60% flagged as an issue, up from 32% last year. Concerns about the fiscal outlook have also increased, with one central bank in Europe mentioning, ‚Äòwe are mindful of potential risks stemming from US fiscal imbalances‚Äô.‚Äù Read the full report here .

The report , titled 2050 Generation‚Äôs Virtual Asset Investment Trends, found that interest in crypto spans age groups, with participation highest among those in their 40s at 31%, followed by those in their 30s at 28%, and in their 50s at 25%. Bitcoin remains the most popular investment, with six in ten investors including it in their holdings, though many diversify into altcoins and stablecoins as they gain experience. Crypto Seen as a Path for Wealth Building and Retirement The study revealed that 78% of respondents in their 50s view crypto as a tool to accumulate wealth, while 53% use it to prepare for retirement . Growth potential, diversification benefits, and structured savings plans are increasingly cited as key reasons for crypto investment across age groups. Interest in expanding crypto holdings is strong, with 70% of respondents indicating plans to increase their investments. Additionally, 42% said they would invest more if traditional financial institutions took a larger role in digital asset markets, while 35% identified stronger legal protections as essential to boosting their confidence. Investment habits are evolving as well. The share of investors making regular purchases rose from 10% to 34%, while mid-term trading increased from 26% to 47%. Short-term trading saw a slight decline, indicating a maturing investment landscape. Reliance on word-of-mouth for information has decreased, while more investors are turning to official exchanges and analytical platforms for insights. Economic Pressures Looms Despite the enthusiasm, the report notes significant concerns about market volatility, with 56% of respondents citing it as a key worry. Many investors also highlighted concerns about exchange reliability and fraud risks. Eli Ilha Yune, chief product officer at Anzaetek, noted last week that South Korea‚Äôs crypto boom is driven more by financial desperation than optimism about blockchain technology. Speaking at German Blockchain Week, Yune pointed to high youth unemployment, which stands at 6.6%‚Äîmore than double the national average‚Äîand a stagnating economy as reasons many young Koreans turn to crypto in search of quick profits amid limited traditional investment opportunities. Amid these pressures, cryptocurrency has become a critical avenue for Korea‚Äôs younger generation, serving as both a potential lifeline and a tool for wealth-building in an economy where many find themselves priced out of real estate and traditional investment returns.

The latest US core PCE data, the Fed‚Äôs preferred gauge, came in at 2.7% year-over-year in May, above the expected 2.6%. Core PCE rose 0.2% month over month, while headline PCE only rose 0.1%, indicating sticky inflation. This supports the Fed‚Äôs cautious tone on rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell advised being patient in upcoming decisions, citing inflation risks, including potential tariffs imposed by former President Trump. Despite this backdrop, Bitcoin is showing resilience, above $106,000, while other risk assets are showing stress. There is no significant selling pressure even after hotter inflation numbers, so market participants are in a wait-and-see mode, waiting for further macro developments or confirmation of a technical breakout. Metaplanet Doubles Down on BTC Institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains, as Japanese firm Metaplanet doubles down on its strategy. The company raised $300M in zero-coupon bonds to accelerate its Bitcoin-only acquisition plan, reaffirming a bold long-term vision under CEO Simon Gerovich. Recent filings indicate that Metaplanet purchased 1,111 BTC during the recent dip, to accumulate 21,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. This is similar to MicroStrategy‚Äôs model but takes it further‚ÄîMetaplanet isn‚Äôt just integrating Bitcoin, it‚Äôs building its entire corporate thesis around it. $300M raised for BTC purchases 1,111 BTC added during market dip Target: 21,000 BTC by 2026, 210,000 BTC by 2027 Bitcoin is Metaplanet‚Äôs only treasury asset The company‚Äôs strategy could mark the beginning of a new wave of corporate adoption as its single-asset approach gains traction in Japan and abroad. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Consolidation Signals Breakout On the technical front , BTC/USD is approaching a breakout after a week of consolidation. Price is at $108,215, testing the upper boundary of the rectangle at $106,450-$108,980. BTC/USD is nearing a breakout after a week-long range. Price is testing the $108,980 ceiling with a bullish engulfing candle and support from the 50-EMA.

MACD is positive so momentum could return if volume comes in to support the next move. A close above $108,980 would likely lead to a test of $110,448 and then $111,944. Bitcoin Price Chart- Source: Tradingview Bitcoin Trade Idea: Entry: Long above $109,000 (confirmed breakout) Targets: $110,448 and $111,944 Stop: Below $106,450 Alternatively, rejection at resistance could lead to a re-entry around $106,450 if buyers defend the mid-range. Until a clear breakout occurs, the Bitcoin price prediction signals a neutral bias in the short run, but a bullish structure is intact.

Its eponymous DEX has now launched in beta, promising true cross-chain swaps that eliminate reliance on bridges or wrapped tokens. Zenswap has high hopes for its novel cross-chain DEX, but for so long as it‚Äôs in beta, swaps have been capped at $500 USDC as a precaution. That threshold should nevertheless prove more than enough for traders curious to see what all the fuss is about. And there‚Äôs a lot to unpack. EVM Gets the DEX It Deserves Zenswap has gone live with support for a number of EVM chains including Ethereum, AVAX, Polygon, and Arbitrum with more on their way including Optimism. And it‚Äôs not stopping there: Solana is also in the roadmap and development is at an advanced stage, with the integration on course to be completed by early July. The backbone of Zenswap is USDC, which all trades route through. It‚Äôs the optimum solution, Zenswap‚Äôs team believes, for avoiding the need for wrapped tokens or pesky bridges. When everything settles in USDC, everything works better, from superior pricing to lower slippage. Swap It Like You Mean It Zenswap uses an intent-based model, which has become increasingly en vogue among the current wave of DEXs and aggregators. Innovative features include Boost Mode, which delivers near-instant swaps. The UX is rather pretty too, it must be said. On the surface, this is technically just another DEX, albeit a slick and highly intuitive one. But beneath the hood, everything runs different. There‚Äôs a lotta DEXs out there now, with many serving the omnichain landscape with a particular focus on EVM and Solana. Zenswap ticks these boxes, but it also offers a whole lot more. Its developer team is confident that a host of L2s, DeFi protocols, and dapps will elect to integrate Zenswap, taking advantage of the composability that is now synonymous with decentralized finance. While Zenswap‚Äôs utility extends to swapping tokens today, there‚Äôs much more that could be done tomorrow once other web3 projects start building on top of it. Imagine being able to top up a DeFi loan on Ethereum using assets held on Solana, for instance. No more frantically bridging funds back to avoid liquidation when the markets turn feisty. The same technology powering Zenswap should prove a boon to projects launching new networks, from sidechains to L2s. It effectively solves the liquidity problem, allowing users to swap tokens from day one at the quoted market price. This prevents the need for nascent networks to attract liquidity mercenaries, who are prone to sticking around only as long as the incentives are in place. In short, there‚Äôs loads that can and will be done with Zenswap. But in the here and now, it forms a welcome addition to the multichain landscape. And with a leaderboard and point system in place, which top traders can convert into tokens at a future date, there are ample incentives to take Zenswap for a test drive.

Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has remained in the $106,000 ‚Äì $107,000 range showing no indications of a breakout in either market direction. Amidst this market consolidation, renowned crypto analyst with X username KillaXBT has highlighted the key liquidation zones in the present Bitcoin market structure that are critical to the next significant price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullishness For Q3 Grows: What Happens In Every Post-Halving Year? Bitcoin: Clustering At $103K‚Äì$106K And $108K‚Äì$111K ‚Äì What Could This Mean? In a recent X post , KillaXBT shares that Bitcoin is currently at a pivotal decision zone as liquidation heatmap data from Coinglass reveals notable liquidity clusters forming on both ends of the current price range. The market expert explains that BTC is trapped between long and short liquidation zones in both low and high time frames (L/HTF) signaling a moment of market indecision On the 7-day chart (LTF), KillaXBT states there are accumulations of long positions between $103,400 and $106,000. This data suggests that a move below this price range could trigger cascading stop-losses and force liquidations, sending Bitcoin prices lower in a short-term decline. On the other hand, there are also liquidity clusters in the $108,000‚Äì$109,000 region, indicating the presence of potentially significant short positions. A breakout above $109,000 could initiate a sharp short squeeze, perhaps driving prices higher toward the current all-time high in the $111,000 price range. Using the 30-day chart (HTF), KillaXBT provides more information on the Bitcoin market stalemate. The analyst notes that more short-side liquidations are clustered between $108,300 and $109,000 than long-side liquidations between $103,000 and $106,000. However, the presence of short positions at $111,000 presents a scenario where bulls could reclaim control if they successfully push past this upper resistance. Ultimately, KillaXBT concludes the current BTC market structure suggests a delicate balance with high-leverage positions stacked both above and below current prices. The market expert warns that traders refrain from engaging the market until the highlighted liquidation zones are tested.

Amid this backdrop, technical analysis from a popular crypto analyst on the TradingView platform outlined a compelling structural setup forming on Bitcoin‚Äôs daily chart. The analysis shows that Bitcoin‚Äôs action is in a compression phase that could precede a breakout to $115,000 very soon. Related Reading: Stablecoin Skepticism Grows As IMF Official Challenges Their Money Role Compression Structure Forming Below $108,000 Resistance Bitcoin‚Äôs price action is currently following movements in traditional risk assets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, both of which have recovered following the recent de-escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Against this backdrop, crypto analyst RLinda shared an outlook on TradingView that highlights a structural setup forming on the D1 chart and predicts a breakout to as high as $115,000 if some resistance levels are cleared. According to RLinda, Bitcoin is in the middle of a compression phase just below the $108,100 resistance level. This follows what the analyst describes as a false breakout above $100,000, which led to a brief distribution and now an active accumulation zone. The daily chart shows price action gradually tightening within the $106,500 to $108,100 range since June 25, the essence of which the analyst called a pause for a breather before a possible continuation of growth. The current setup has already established well-defined boundaries, with support at $106,500 and $108,100 as immediate resistance. A breakout above this immediate resistance would pave the way for the next resistance around $110,400 and bring Bitcoin within striking distance of its all-time high at $111,000. On the other hand, a short-term pullback toward $105,650 is still possible before a new move to the upside. Bitcoin Price Levels To Watch Bitcoin‚Äôs price action is really pressing on this resistance level around $108,000 and is building momentum for a breakout once the price level gives way. The key resistance levels to monitor are stacked around $108,100, $108,900, and $110,400. As long as the structure between $106,500 and $108,100 holds, and Bitcoin‚Äôs price is sticky near the top of that zone, the breakout scenario becomes increasingly probable. Although there are currently no reasons for a decline on the daily and weekly candlestick charts, the analyst noted that a temporary pullback to $105,650 or even $104,650 cannot be ruled out. However, even such a pullback would likely only serve as a retest but still keep the broader setup intact.

Key Takeaways: TIME named Coinbase a 2025 ‚Äúdisruptor,‚Äù citing its outsized influence on US crypto policy and markets. Coinbase‚Äôs stock surged 42% this year, boosted by Senate passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and S&P 500 inclusion. The exchange is expanding in Europe and pursuing tokenized equities approval. The recognition follows a sharp 42% year-to-date surge in Coinbase‚Äôs stock, which climbed from around $303 to a high of $382 after the Senate passed the GENIUS stablecoin bill on June 17. TIME noted that Coinbase , which in May became the first crypto stock added to the S&P 500 index, is ‚Äúa key driver of the industry‚Äôs policy efforts in Washington D.C.‚Äù Coinbase to Be at the Center of US Crypto Hub: TIME With more industry-friendly legislation on the horizon, the publication said Coinbase could cement its role as the central hub for US crypto trading. Coinbase‚Äôs influence extends beyond the US. On June 20, the exchange secured a license to provide digital asset services across the European Union under the MiCA regulatory framework, granted by Luxembourg‚Äôs financial regulator. Coinbase will establish its EU headquarters in Luxembourg, a move expected to strengthen its global footprint. Looking ahead, Coinbase is seeking approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to offer tokenized equities , a move that could pit it directly against trading platforms like Robinhood and WeBull in the battle for retail investors. Moien, L√´tzebuerg. We‚Äôre pleased to have secured our Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) licence from the CSSF in Luxembourg. We can now offer a full suite of crypto products and services to 450 million people across all 27 European Union member states. pic.twitter.com/e9zbhy35YQ ‚Äî Coinbase (@coinbase) June 20, 2025 Adding to Coinbase‚Äôs momentum, US President Donald Trump pledged at the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit in June to build a ‚Äúclear and simple‚Äù regulatory framework for crypto markets under his administration. In a pre-recorded message, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin.‚Äù Coinbase‚Äôs rising profile and policy wins come as institutional and retail investors increasingly view the exchange as a bellwether for the broader crypto market‚Äôs health. Coinbase Q1 Revenue Climbs, But Profit Falls 94% Coinbase reported mixed first-quarter results , with revenue rising 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, but falling short of analyst expectations and down 10% from the previous quarter. While transaction revenue grew to $1.26 billion, its subscription and services division‚Äîcovering staking and custodial offerings, rose 37% to nearly $700 million, reflecting growing diversification beyond trading. Despite the revenue uptick, net income plunged 94% to $66 million as the company marked down its crypto holdings amid market volatility. Adjusted earnings stood at $526.6 million, or $1.94 per share, still below last year‚Äôs figure of $2.53. Operating expenses surged 51% to $1.3 billion due to aggressive marketing and asset write-downs.

This demand, locked up since the 2021 trading prohibition, just blew the doors open last week after Guotai Junan International , a Hong Kong-listed brokerage backed by the mainland, received a license to operate a virtual asset trading business. The license triggered a buying frenzy. On Wednesday, Guotai‚Äôs shares nearly tripled in price, putting it at the top of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by total trading value. The next day, it stayed at number one, even overtaking Alibaba. On Friday, it slipped to second place behind Xiaomi , which launched its electric car the night before. The data, published by Wind Information, shows a clear trend: mainland buyers are pouring money into Hong Kong stocks linked to crypto activity to get a taste of what they can‚Äôt legally hold at home. Hong Kong‚Äôs crypto license pushes Guotai to the front The opening for these investors came after Hong Kong passed a stablecoin bill in May, allowing financial companies to issue and manage crypto assets tied to fiat currencies. Since the mainland considers crypto trading illegal, this move gave Hong Kong-listed firms with licenses a significant edge. Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Chief China Economist Robin Xing, in a June 19 note, explained why this matters. ‚ÄúWe believe China‚Äôs newfound interest in stablecoins is driven by concerns that legislation of US stablecoins could extend dollar dominance,‚Äù Robin said. The note added that the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) is now looking at Hong Kong as a sandbox to test alternative payment tools. Despite the crypto ban, PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng spoke in mid-June about the importance of stablecoins and pointed to weaknesses in older payment systems that digital tech can potentially fix. That‚Äôs where the pivot becomes clear. Robin and his team took Pan‚Äôs remarks as a hint that change might be coming, though nothing official has been rolled out yet. China Renaissance, TF Securities chase the same play Other firms followed fast. On Thursday, China Renaissance said it would invest $100 million over two years into crypto and Web3 development. That same day, it also brought on Frank Fu, the former CEO of Huobi Americas, as an independent non-executive director. The company, also known as CR Holdings, saw its stock jump 20% last week. Back on the mainland, where stocks face tighter trading restrictions, Shanghai-listed TF Securities confirmed that its subsidiary, TF International, had also secured a Hong Kong crypto trading license. That news sent TF shares up by 29% last week. Even firms without clear crypto connections are getting swept into the wave. Eastmoney, a financial data and brokerage company, saw the highest trading turnover on mainland exchanges last week, both in share volume and price. It hasn‚Äôt said anything about virtual assets, but its stock still rose 11%. Li Dongfang, a finance blogger based in Beijing, said the Guotai rally is being driven by first-mover excitement, not by hard fundamentals. ‚ÄúThe stock price surge is due more to investors pursuing emerging themes and following first-mover advantage,‚Äù Li wrote in Chinese, as translated by CNBC . He added that other brokerages will likely get similar approvals, but their stocks might not swing as wildly. The crackdown on crypto was always about managing financial risk. A population of 1.4 billion doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of room for unchecked speculation. But even without formal approval, the interest hasn‚Äôt slowed down. It just found a new path. This year, Consensus, the massive crypto conference based in New York, held its first event in Hong Kong back in February. It plans another for 2025. The growing number of crypto-related conferences in the region shows how much attention Hong Kong is drawing as a crypto gateway. The expansion of stablecoins in cross-border trade is another trend being watched. Recent Chinese business reports noted that a unit of JD.com , together with Standard Chartered, is now officially part of Hong Kong‚Äôs stablecoin pilot. The goal is to see how these tokens could support exports and online sales‚Äîwithout touching traditional banks.

Two notable contenders, established giant Ripple (XRP) and agile newcomer Remittix (RTX) , are vying for a major share. This article explores a powerful hypothetical: how high could their prices go if either managed to capture 25% of this lucrative market? Remittix‚Äôs calculated bid for market dominance Remittix (RTX) is engineered from the ground up with the specific goal of tackling the inefficiencies of the cross-border market. Rather than just launching another token, Remittix‚Äôs strategy is to provide a complete toolkit for merging crypto with traditional finance. Remittix‚Äôs powerful API and Checkout tools are central to its mission, acting as a bridge for businesses to effortlessly accept crypto and receive immediate fiat settlements. This design removes the friction of compliance and technical hurdles that have long kept companies on the sidelines of the digital economy. Through this sharp focus on real-world business adoption, Remittix is charting its course to capture a significant slice of the market. Its decentralized nature also gives it a distinct advantage over traditional payment rails, making it resilient to local restrictions and geopolitical pressures, thus offering a more stable solution for global enterprises. If Remittix were to successfully claim 25% of the $10 trillion cross-border market, its ecosystem would manage a staggering $2.5 trillion in value. With Remittix‚Äôs fixed total supply of 1.5 billion RTX tokens, this implies a speculative but mathematically grounded price of approximately $1,666 per RTX. This staggering potential is a core reason why its presale , which has already raised over $15.8 million, is attracting so much attention. Ripple ‚Äòs path to a trillion-dollar valuation Ripple (XRP) is bolstering its position with the significant XRP Ledger software version 2.5.0 upgrade . This update introduces powerful, institutional-grade features like batch transactions for executing multiple payments at once and token escrow for its upcoming RLUSD stablecoin, functionalities crucial for building a sophisticated DeFi ecosystem on the XRPL. These enhancements are explicitly designed to put the XRP Ledger on a competitive footing with networks like Ethereum and Solana, capitalizing on renewed interest that has made XRP the most-viewed crypto asset on the CME Group‚Äôs platform. This fundamental progress fuels a more tangible XRP price prediction. If XRP leverages these upgrades to capture 25% of the $10 trillion market, its market cap would hit $2.5 trillion. With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, this translates to a price of $25 per XRP. While a substantial increase from its current price of around $2.20, this figure provides a grounded reality check for the more speculative XRP price prediction targets, which have ranged from $26 to as high as $526 by 2050. This makes the $25 target a key benchmark for any future XRP price prediction based on market capture. At this point, XRP isn‚Äôt anywhere near the $25 mark. Source: CoinMarketCap Identifying the superior growth trajectory Under this market-capture scenario, the growth trajectories for each project diverge dramatically. A $25 XRP valuation would represent an impressive 12x return from its current price, validating a very bullish long-term XRP price prediction. In stark contrast, Remittix hitting $1,666 from its presale price would deliver a life-changing return of over 21,000x. For investors hunting for exponential growth, the math is clear. XRP‚Äôs large supply inherently caps its hyper-growth potential, making Remittix the superior choice for capitalizing on the asymmetric returns offered by an agile disruptor. While the XRP price prediction is solid, RTX‚Äôs potential is simply in another league.

Meanwhile, Everscale (EVER) spiked on the back of a high-profile conference and ecosystem upgrades, and Shentu (CTK) soared despite a lack of clear catalysts.

While BTC showed greater resilience compared to ETH, both assets rebounded strongly as tensions appeared to ease. According to a weekly report by the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance recorded a slight decline during the recovery. However, this is not a strong indication that the market will soon witness an altseason. BTC, ETH Prices Rebound Binance said bitcoin‚Äôs resilience signaled a potential shift toward risk assets as macro conditions somewhat improved. After a broader shakeout triggered by geopolitical tensions, both traditional assets and BTC ended the week in the green. However, BTC solidified its position as an emerging hedge asset amid geopolitical uncertainty, recovering to $107,000 after falling to $98,000 at the beginning of the week. On the other hand, ETH followed a similar trajectory but exhibited greater downside volatility and a less pronounced recovery. The asset‚Äôs performance showed that it is less established in the role of a hedge asset. ETH closed the week below its opening price at $2,480 after plunging to a low of $2,130 on Monday. ‚ÄúWhile it remains uncertain whether Bitcoin will sustain its outperformance following this weekend‚Äôs events, its strong initial recovery may signal market expectations for a continued upward trend in the largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at ~66%,‚Äù Binance added. Altseason Optimism Fades As both assets strive to remain above certain support zones, optimism for an altseason in this cycle is fading. Investors are increasingly asking when the altseason will begin. According to historical data, these have consistently followed strong BTC rallies, becoming more pronounced when the leading asset enters a consolidation phase. During these times, capital has rotated from BTC to more volatile, small-cap altcoins with higher speculative appeal. Interestingly, past altcoin seasons have been characterized by new industry themes, such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and layer-2 solutions. In this cycle, the prevailing concepts ‚Äî meme coins, BitcoinFi, and decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) ‚Äî are modifications of previous trends, so they are not strong enough to trigger major rallies. This cycle is also different because of the oversaturated market of new projects. Binance analysts insist that even if fresh capital flows into altcoins, it is likely to be diluted across the numerous tokens currently in existence. Hence, the market requires a significant catalyst to trigger the altseason, as capital rotation and industry narratives are no longer sufficient.

The token is currently at phase 5 of its 11-phased presale and has a 200 percent rise since its initial offered price of 0001. Since the beginning of the presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has collected 11,300,000 dollars, and the amount of offered tokens exceeds 575 million ones, with 12,600 people being the holders of the offered amount. The Phase 5 is more than 50 percent filled up and this is an indicator that the time to purchase the asset at this price is getting narrow. The phase 6 will follow its rise to 16.7 percent to 0.035 dollars. The launch value is set at $0.06, which gives early adopters a 100 percent guarantee. This robust demand underscores Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs potential. Moreover, its innovative features set it apart in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining decentralized lending with a dual-model approach. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system uses smart contracts to manage liquidity pools. These contracts adjust interest rates based on market activity. Lenders enjoy stable returns, while borrowers access predictable terms. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model connects users directly, bypassing intermediaries. This suits volatile assets, offering tailored loan terms. Both systems ensure transparency and user control, unlike centralized platforms. Depositors receive mtTokens, which accrue interest and enable trading or staking. This flexibility enhances Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs appeal in the crypto market. Furthermore, the platform‚Äôs focus on utility strengthens its position as a top crypto investment. Security and stablecoin strength Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust through rigorous security measures. The team has completed a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. No security incidents have occurred in the past 90 days. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering $50,000 in USDT rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. This ensures ongoing vigilance. The project is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, fully collateralized to avoid depegging risks. This stablecoin will boost liquidity and reduce volatility. Consequently, these features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a secure crypto investment. Rewarding investors with growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rewarding early supporters with enticing incentives. The team is hosting a $100,000 giveaway , splitting $10,000 in MUTM tokens among 10 winners. Participation requires a $50 minimum presale investment and completing simple quests, like submitting a wallet address. Additionally, a leaderboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. The project‚Äôs buyback system uses protocol revenue to purchase MUTM tokens, distributing them to mtToken stakers for passive dividends. With a 4 billion token supply, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) forecasts a $2.50 price in 2025, offering an 8,233% return from $0.03. This positions it as a top crypto for long-term gains. Meanwhile, its Layer 2 scaling plans promise lower fees and faster transactions. A bright future awaits Investors eyeing the next big cryptocurrency find Mutuum Finance (MUTM) compelling. Its presale success, with $11,300,000 raised and 12,600 holders, reflects strong confidence. The guaranteed 100% ROI at launch, coupled with a potential $2.50 price in 2025, offers substantial returns.

This is in line with the growing chatter that ETH could reach $10,000 in this cycle, as it has been stuck in a multi-year channel since 2017. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows highlights the significance of Ethereum‚Äôs long-term rising trend. Historical touchpoints along the lower band of this channel have triggered massive rallies, with increases of up to 300x in 2017 and 50x in 2020. While such extreme multiples are less likely now due to ETH‚Äôs $292 billion market cap, Pillows believes a climb toward $10,000 remains plausible. Analyst Spots Long-Term Pattern That Could Send ETH to $10,000 https://t.co/8E8yK0cuaK #Crypto #Ethereum ‚Äî Coindoo.com (@coindoo) June 29, 2025 However, technical resistance must first be overcome. ETH was twice rejected near $2,600 in June. Analysts like Crypto Patel signal a clean break, and a close over $2,800 would confirm a bullish shift, potentially targeting $4,000 and beyond. Whale Activity and Withdrawals Reflect Long-Term Belief On-chain data supports the bullish thesis. Whale wallets and institutions are steadily accumulating ETH, even as price action remains range-bound. Lookonchain reports SharpLink Gaming acquired $4.82 million worth of ETH OTC, raising its total exposure to $478 million. Sharplink Gaming bought another $4,820,000 $ETH via OTC. They now hold $425,470,000 Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/0QtDdHcUAS ‚Äî Ted (@TedPillows) June 28, 2025 Additional signs of confidence: $4.56M deposited into Ethereum‚Äôs Beacon Chain, likely for staking $293M withdrawn from exchanges‚Äîsuggesting a move to cold wallets Low volatility accompanied by high-value transfers These patterns suggest whales are preparing for future appreciation rather than trading short-term moves. Network Growth vs Market Price: Disconnect or Opportunity? Ethereum‚Äôs network activity is surging. Daily transactions have topped 1.5 million, and active addresses exceed 356,000‚Äîthe highest levels since early 2023. Gas fees have jumped 130% in a week, reaching $10.26M, indicating increased demand for DeFi and NFT platforms. Despite this, ETH‚Äôs price lags. Key valuation indicators reflect caution: NVT Ratio spiked to 2044‚Äîimplying price may be ahead of usage MVRV Z-score dipped into negative territory, suggesting holders are underwater This disconnect between price and fundamentals could be a hidden buying opportunity‚Äîor a sign of excessive hype. Bitcoin Final Take: Breakout Depends on Key Levels Although the Ethereum price prediction remains bullish, is it really heading toward $10,000? Well, that depends on: Break above $2,800 to confirm the trend Whale interest and staking flows to stick Network usage to translate into price gains If ETH maintains its support around $2,400 and Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stabilizes, Ethereum may follow with a breakout. Analysts at XForceGlobal expect a Wyckoff-style move toward $9,400 if momentum builds. Ethereum Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview For now, ETH‚Äôs bullish trajectory is intact‚Äîbut upside depends on reclaiming key resistance levels and validating long-term investor conviction through sustained volume and accumulation. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.74M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has surpassed $1.74 million in its public presale, with $1,748,091.98 raised out of a $1,974,249 target.

Market intelligence suggests DALPY represents what analysts describe as an ‚Äúasymmetric opportunity,‚Äù comparable to acquiring Dogecoin at $0.0002‚Äîa scenario that has generated significant anticipation among sophisticated investors. Institutional Investment Activity Signals Confidence Market surveillance indicates that 47 major cryptocurrency investment funds are actively monitoring DALPY‚Äôs pre-launch developments. These institutions include the same players that accumulated Bitcoin positions below $100 and Ethereum at single-digit valuations, lending credibility to DALPY‚Äôs current positioning strategy. Private equity sources further reveal that these funds have allocated dedicated research budgets for DALPY evaluation‚Äîevidence of serious institutional consideration well beyond the speculative nature typical of meme coin projects. Historically, this level of institutional attention has preceded substantial price appreciation phases. Strategic Market Catalysts Fuel Optimism Tier-1 Exchange Listing Progress Industry insiders report that listing discussions between DALPY and the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange ecosystem have advanced to the ‚Äúfinal approval stages.‚Äù Confidential communications indicate that exchange executives have expressed unusual enthusiasm for DALPY‚Äôs market positioning and community growth metrics. Tier-1 exchange listings have historically triggered price surges of 500% to 2000% within 72 hours. However, DALPY‚Äôs unique positioning and robust institutional backing suggest the potential for significantly higher returns compared to previous cases. Celebrity Endorsement Pipeline in Development Entertainment industry sources confirm that A-list celebrities and mega-influencers with a combined reach exceeding 200 million followers are in advanced negotiations for DALPY promotional partnerships. Talent agency insiders describe these discussions as some of the largest cryptocurrency endorsement deals ever structured. If confirmed, analysts predict that the resulting FOMO wave could surpass previous celebrity-fueled crypto rallies, potentially leading to unprecedented levels of retail investor participation. $DALPY Presale: A Window of Early Access DALPY is set to debut through an upcoming presale, offering early investors the opportunity to enter at the most favorable price point. Industry participants widely view presales as critical phases for maximizing returns in emerging cryptocurrency projects. Limited Presale Allocation Only a very small percentage of DALPY‚Äôs total token supply will be made available during the presale phase. With institutional and large-scale investor demand expected to be high, the amount accessible to retail investors is anticipated to be highly limited. High Return Potential Market analysts cautiously suggest that presale participants could see potential returns of over 10,000% following DALPY‚Äôs public trading debut. Such projections fuel speculation that DALPY may surpass the explosive early growth seen by historical meme coin success stories, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Market Conditions Amplifying $DALPY‚Äôs Potential Current cryptocurrency market dynamics appear highly favorable for DALPY‚Äôs growth trajectory. Bitcoin dominance is declining, signaling a potential rotation of capital into alternative assets, while the meme coin sector remains highly active. Additionally, the continued expansion of the Solana ecosystem provides essential infrastructure to support DALPY‚Äôs long-term scalability. Growing interest from celebrities and influencers is also expected to drive mainstream awareness, accelerating adoption beyond the crypto-native community. DALPY appears strategically positioned to capitalize on these conditions. Whether the project will become the next legendary 1000X coin remains to be seen, but it has clearly captured the attention of investors and market observers alike.

In the bank‚Äôs annual report, General Manager of the BIS, Agustin Carstens, detailed how Trump‚Äôs tariffs disrupted the economy, pointing to elevated uncertainty levels during enforcement. However, the situation has stabilized somewhat during the ongoing 90-day suspension . He explained , ‚ÄúWe were meant to have a soft landing ‚Äî everything was going according to plan. Then we had this very substantive period of volatility with the threat that tariffs would make more difficult convergence towards 2% in some countries.‚Äù The BIS warns that the global economy is vulnerable to disruptions Carstens argued that the global economy is at a critical stage and countries are looking at a period of elevated uncertainty. In the BIS report, he warned that economic growth potential is slowing, with threats to price stability, fiscal health, and the broader financial system mounting. He added that the global economy is especially vulnerable to disruptions with the ongoing climate and geopolitical changes, an increasing aging population and supply chain challenges. Additionally, the report showed that the post-COVID inflation surge affected people‚Äôs perception of price movements, and the high public debt levels do not make the situation any lighter. When Trump‚Äôs tariffs were first introduced, markets fell sharply and have only partially recovered. The bank‚Äôs report showed that investor confidence was severely shaken at the time, and while doubts remain, the pause on tariffs helped ease some of that uncertainty. So far, the US dollar has dropped 10% in 2025 and could quickly grow to be the most significant H1 drop since the early 1970s, according to Hyun Song Shin, the BIS‚Äôs main economic advisor. Shin maintained that there‚Äôs still no sign that investors are moving away from the American currency, as some economists may have hinted. He¬†claimed it‚Äôs still too early to determine anything, especially since sovereign funds and central banks move slowly. Shin, however, noted that treasuries and other US assets may have contributed to the dollar‚Äôs recent depreciation. The BIS recommended reducing trade barriers and bureaucracy to cultivate growth The BIS believes that inflation and instability risks are more likely to emerge from, or be amplified by, tensions in sovereign bond markets. It also warned that the increasing doubts in fiscal sustainability may make refinancing debt harder and affect inflation expectations. It has thus called for more flexible labor policies, reduced bureaucracy and trade barriers, increased public investment, and advocated fiscal repair to promote growth and productivity. Officials, however, cautioned against easing bank regulatory laws and even urged for more supervision of non-bank financial institutions. They also asked central banks to tread carefully when weighing growth against inflation, as market participants remain highly reactive to price shifts. The Deputy General Manager, Andrea Maechler, even argued that a price surge today is no longer seen as a temporary blip but a potential sign of inflation. The bank‚Äôs officials also advised central banks to stick to their primary mandates to ensure client trust and the effectiveness of their actions, and warned of the growing attention to stablecoins. Aside from that, Carstens cautioned that the US Federal Reserve may face turbulence, especially with Chair Jerome Powell opposing reduced interest rates that the White House insists on. He believes the central bank could see ‚Äúhigher inflationary pressures or deviating inflationary expectations and a slowdown in the economy.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to documents reviewed by The Kenyan Wall Street, the draft bill includes a private think tank, the Virtual Asset Chamber of Commerce (VAC), as part of the regulatory board that will oversee the crypto sector. Critics argue that VAC has previously hosted Binance-sponsored regulatory discussions, raising questions about its independence and whether it acts as a proxy for the global crypto exchange. Binance Ties with Kenya Regulatory Board Local crypto stakeholders have raised concerns about the transparency of VAC‚Äôs inclusion in the proposed regulatory board, noting its previous activities and alleged financial ties with Binance. ‚ÄúAll regulation convos by VAC that happened recently have been sponsored by Binance. Then VAC, a private consulting entity, with a non-compete with Binance ‚Äòmagically‚Äô gets a regulatory seat? How is this fair?‚Äù one stakeholder told The Kenyan Wall Street. Reports allege that Binance pays VAC $6,000 per country monthly for policy advocacy, raising concerns that the group may influence Kenya‚Äôs crypto regulations in Binance‚Äôs favor while sidelining local players. Some stakeholders fear that if entities with conflicts of interest guide crypto regulation, Kenya may risk remaining on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and EU grey lists, hindering the country‚Äôs access to global financial systems. Critics also pointed to similar concerns over VAC‚Äôs reported involvement in regulatory discussions in Rwanda, indicating a broader pattern of influence across African crypto markets. VAC Defends Role Responding to the concerns, VAC director Basil Ogolla defended the group‚Äôs track record, noting its two years of consultations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and Parliament. ‚ÄúThe National Assembly‚Äôs decision to include VAC as a nominator in the regulatory board reflects the trust and confidence built through this track record of meaningful engagement,‚Äù Ogolla stated. The proposed regulatory board will also include representatives from the National Treasury, CBK, Capital Markets Authority (CMA), along with legal and accounting professionals. Binance did not respond to Cointelegraph‚Äôs request for comment. Meanwhile, the exchange continues to deepen its relationships with governments globally. In May, Binance signed an MOU with Kyrgyzstan to support crypto payments and blockchain education, while CEO Richard Teng recently confirmed the company is advising several governments on establishing Bitcoin reserves and crypto policies.

33767162,[object Object],1751206144,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,New Crypto Projects to Watch After Ripple-SEC Case Ends,https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-projects-to-watch-after-ripple-sec-case-ends/,"Crypto investors woke up to a refreshing change of tone this week. The long-running courtroom drama between Ripple and the SEC, one of the most talked-about sagas in crypto history, has finally wrapped up. With years of legal fog now lifting, a clearer path is emerging for blockchain builders and token projects. For many in the industry, this moment feels like a release valve has been opened. There‚Äôs a renewed sense of optimism and possibility, especially for teams working on real-world applications like payments, remittances, and decentralized finance. Regulation clarity, even in small doses, gives developers and investors the confidence to build and back bold ideas. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre seeing. As one door closes on Ripple‚Äôs legal battle, another opens for new crypto projects ‚Äì some of which could carry the torch forward. Ripple vs. SEC: The Legal Drama Finally Ends The Ripple-SEC case, which began in December 2020, has finally wrapped. The SEC accused Ripple Labs of selling XRP as an unregistered security, triggering years of courtroom back-and-forth. In August 2024, the court ruled that XRP wasn‚Äôt a security when traded on exchanges, but said institutional sales did break securities laws. Ripple pushed back with a cross-appeal, while the SEC filed its own. Now, both sides are dropping their appeals and calling it quits. Ripple will pay a $125M fine and accept a permanent ban on institutional XRP sales. While neither side got a total win, the fight is over. More importantly, this outcome clears a path for the crypto industry, showing that even high-stakes regulatory battles can end without killing innovation. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì One Day Left to Ride the Bitcoin Wave With Ripple‚Äôs case finally closed, the market‚Äôs attention is shifting to Bitcoin, and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is perfectly timed to catch that wave. This meme-powered, Bitcoin-linked token has raised $7.6M in presale and is priced at $0.00258, but there‚Äôs only 1 day left to buy $BTCBULL until the presale ends. What makes it stand out? $BTCBULL is the first meme coin that rewards holders with real Bitcoin every time $BTC hits key milestones like $150K, $200K, and beyond. It also burns tokens at each milestone like when the $BTC price reaches $125K, $175K, or $225K, reducing supply and increasing value. You‚Äôll only receive the Bitcoin airdrops if you buy and hold $BTCBULL through Best Wallet , so don‚Äôt miss that detail. In a sea of meme coins with no real backing, $BTCBULL combines hype with actual incentives. It‚Äôs built to let everyday investors benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs rise without needing to buy a whole $BTC. With the bull market heating up and only hours left in presale, $BTCBULL might be the smartest meme coin bet out there. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ‚Äì Ripple‚Äôs Spiritual Successor If Ripple just stepped off the stage, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is stepping right into the spotlight. With a presale raise of $1.7M and a current price of $0.012075, this project isn‚Äôt riding hype ‚Äì it‚Äôs offering serious tech. $HYPER aims to fulfill what Ripple once promised: lightning-fast, low-cost, cross-border payments. But unlike Ripple, Bitcoin Hyper is fully decentralized and built for the future. At its core, Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). That gives it blazing speed, near-zero gas fees, and full compatibility with Solana‚Äôs dApps, NFTs, and DeFi ecosystems. It turns Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active financial layer, where payments, staking, meme coins, and DAOs can actually thrive. It‚Äôs also cross-chain from day one, enabling seamless movement between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more. $HYPER powers it all ‚Äì staking, governance, transactions, and launch access. With forecasts suggesting a price range of $0.15 to $0.32 in 2025, the upside for early buyers is very real. 3. Little‚ÄØPepe ($LILPEPE) ‚Äì Meme-Powered Layer 2 for Speed and Culture Little‚ÄØPepe ($LILPEPE) is currently priced at $0.0013 and has raised $2.8M in its presale. This project brings memes home with a purpose: it‚Äôs a Layer‚Äë2 EVM compatible blockchain built for ultra-low fees, high-speed transactions, security, and a dash of meme magic. Little‚ÄØPepe is fully audited, with smart contracts vetted for vulnerabilities, gas efficiency, and ERC‚Äë20 compliance. The Roadmap promises lightning-fast, culture-first infrastructure that supports meme coins , DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more ‚Äì all without congesting the Ethereum mainnet. There‚Äôs even a $777K giveaway‚Äì ten lucky crypto presale participants will each win $77K worth of $LILPEPE tokens. With the Ripple vs. SEC blockade now cleared, Little‚ÄØPepe arrives at the perfect time to build on brighter regulatory horizons and tap into renewed optimism. If you‚Äôre hunting fresh new crypto infrastructure that marries culture, speed, and real tech, $LILPEPE is a strong contender. The Next Wave Begins Now With Ripple‚Äôs legal chapter closed, the door is open for fresh innovation. Projects like BTC Bull Token , Bitcoin Hyper , and Little Pepe are stepping up with bold visions, strong tech, and real community energy. Whether you‚Äôre after $BTC rewards, next-gen payments, or meme-fueled speed, there‚Äôs a presale play here for you. This is not financial advice.
