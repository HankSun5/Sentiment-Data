According to analyst Xaif, social data from Santiment reveals that XRP‚Äôs bullish-to-bearish comment ratio has climbed to 2.1 to 1, its highest level in over two weeks. This renewed optimism starkly contrasts with the declining sentiment around Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), both of which are showing signs of fatigue across social platforms. Ripple-SEC Case Nears Conclusion The shift in sentiment comes just days after a critical development in the Ripple-SEC legal saga. On June 26, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres formally rejected the refiled joint motion submitted by Ripple and the SEC. The proposed motion had sought to modify the court‚Äôs earlier judgment by reducing Ripple‚Äôs penalty from $125 million to $50 million and lifting the standing injunction against its institutional XRP sales. BREAKING: XRP Sees Abnormally Bullish Sentiment Despite Ripple v. SEC Setback! highest in 2+ weeks, outshining BTC & ETH #XRP #Ripple #Crypto pic.twitter.com/XtLycKbIp4 ‚Äî ùïèaif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 27, 2025 Her decision reinforced the validity of the court‚Äôs July 2023 final judgment, which still holds Ripple liable for a $125 million penalty and enforces a permanent injunction on certain XRP transactions. Appeals Withdrawn, Case Winds Down Despite the setback, Ripple has opted to bring the legal battle to an end. On June 27, CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company would withdraw its counter-appeal . The SEC is also expected to drop its appeal. With both sides moving away from further litigation, the case is finally winding down after more than three years of court proceedings. The withdrawal of appeals signals that neither party intends to continue disputing the terms of the standing final judgment. For XRP holders, this conclusion brings long-awaited clarity. Although the court declined to reduce Ripple‚Äôs penalty or lift the injunction, the fact that the matter is now essentially closed eliminates the legal overhang that has clouded XRP‚Äôs future since late 2020. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Sentiment Soars as Legal Uncertainty Fades What might appear as a procedural defeat has instead fueled optimism across the XRP community. Many investors view the resolution as a net positive, particularly since the most important aspect of the July 2023 ruling remains intact: Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not a security, and that Ripple‚Äôs programmatic sales did not violate securities laws. While Ripple was found liable for its institutional sales, the decision marked a major legal victory for the broader crypto industry and a defining moment for XRP‚Äôs regulatory status. As the legal dust settles, XRP‚Äôs sentiment spike reflects more than just relief; it‚Äôs a sign of confidence in the token‚Äôs long-term viability. With legal risks behind it, XRP is now poised to reenter the spotlight based on its use case, technology, and adoption potential, rather than its courtroom drama. A Turning Point for XRP XRP‚Äôs rising sentiment underscores a broader narrative shift. XRP is emerging from its defining legal battle with one of the clearest legal profiles in the digital asset space. Xaif‚Äôs sentiment analysis captures a community that is no longer weighed down by litigation but is instead looking forward, with renewed conviction. For traders and investors alike, this may mark the beginning of a new phase for XRP‚Äîone focused on growth, clarity, and market momentum.

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum of $16.26 and a minimum of $13.05. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $30.04 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot‚Äôs position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let‚Äôs get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.35 (+1.36%) Market Cap $6.32B Trading Volume $156.75M Circulating Supply 1.58B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $4.12 24-hour Low $3.98 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 7.77% 50-Day SMA $4.42 14-Day RSI 48.45 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $4.54 Polkadot price analysis: DOT price rebounds to $3.35 with key support holding firm Tight range shows market caution. DOT is trading between $3.30 and $3.39, signaling consolidation and low volatility. $3.39 resistance remains firm, and repeated failures to break above $3.39 show a strong seller presence at that level. Higher lows suggest bullish pressure, gradual higher lows point to steady buying interest, and potential for an upward breakout. Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading at $3.35, showing a modest daily gain of 1.36% as of June 28th, 2025. This latest price movement positions DOT near the upper end of its daily range, with resistance identified at $3.39 and support sitting at $3.30. The asset‚Äôs performance reflects renewed buying interest as bulls attempt to regain control within a tight consolidation range. DOT‚Äôs price has stabilized after a period of muted volatility, following broader market indecision. The cryptocurrency remains well below its all-time high of $55.00 reached on November 4, 2021, marking a steep drawdown of 93.89%. However, the asset has managed to maintain a significant buffer above its all-time low of $2.69 recorded on August 20, 2020, representing a recovery of 24.7% from that point. Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT key levels constrain breakout attempts The daily chart displays a relatively narrow trading channel, with DOT fluctuating between its intraday low of $3.30 and high of $3.39. Price action reveals that DOT dipped below its 1-day opening value early in the session but rebounded sharply in the late U.S. and early Asian sessions. The bulls successfully defended the $3.30 support level, initiating a gradual upside that pushed the asset into positive territory. The $3.35 level has now become a vital mid-point marker, as it coincides with a visible area of volume interest and short-term buyer accumulation. DOT Price Chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, hovering just below the 50 level, suggesting balanced momentum without overbought or oversold conditions. The 20-day EMA is flatlining, indicating market indecision and a lack of strong directional momentum. However, price holding above this level signals potential accumulation. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT uptrend builds with higher lows On the 4-hour chart, DOT has been forming a consistent pattern of higher lows, reflecting gradual upward momentum. The asset is attempting to break through the immediate resistance at $3.39 but continues to face rejection near that level. DOT Price Chart The short-term trend favors the bulls as long as the price remains above the $3.32 region. However, failure to clear $3.39 could result in a minor retracement, with interim support visible at $3.34. Volume remains moderate, and a decisive breakout is still lacking. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.13 SELL SMA 5 $4.22 SELL SMA 10 $4.14 SELL SMA 21 $4.31 SELL SMA 50 $4.42 SELL SMA 100 $4.29 SELL SMA 200 $4.54 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.27 SELL EMA 5 $4.25 SELL EMA 10 $4.18 SELL EMA 21 $4.18 SELL EMA 50 $4.43 SELL EMA 100 $4.92 SELL EMA 200 $5.38 SELL What to expect next? Polkadot‚Äôs price structure suggests a critical moment is approaching. With DOT stuck in a tight $3.30‚Äì$3.39 range, a breakout or breakdown from this zone will likely set the tone for its next move. If bulls manage a clean break above $3.39 with volume confirmation, the price could target the next psychological level around $3.45 and potentially extend toward $3.50. Sustained higher lows support this scenario. On the other hand, failure to break resistance could lead to short-term selling pressure. If DOT slips below the $3.32‚Äì$3.30 support band, it may test lower levels near $3.25. Traders should watch closely for volume spikes and price reaction at these key levels, as they will determine whether DOT continues consolidating or starts a directional trend. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot offers strong long-term potential with its unique multi-chain architecture and focus on interoperability. Its technology continues to attract developers and attention in the blockchain space. However, DOT is still down nearly 94% from its all-time high, reflecting broader market weakness and competitive pressures. While long-term prospects remain solid, short-term gains depend on a breakout above key resistance levels. It suits long-term holders more than short-term traders unless volatility increases. Why is Polkadot Up today? Polkadot (DOT) is up 1.36% today, trading at $3.35 as of June 28th, 2025. The price increase is driven by renewed buyer interest near the $3.30 support level, which held firm during recent sessions. This rebound comes as traders respond to DOT forming higher lows on the intraday charts, signaling building bullish pressure. The asset‚Äôs move toward the $3.39 resistance suggests growing optimism, but buyers are still awaiting a confirmed breakout to gain stronger momentum. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If favorable market conditions continue, we could see a bullish trend, and Polkadot has the potential to recover.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021.

The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement.

DOGE has proven that even the most unlikely coins can make people rich, from its inception as a joke to its massive rise that has made millionaires. However, with Dogecoin now maturing and its early days behind it, investors are seeking the next big opportunity. If you missed the DOGE rocket, all hope is not lost. The next ‚ÄúDogecoin moment‚Äù might be brewing right now in projects that combine innovative tech with strong narratives and active communities. Below are eight promising alternatives‚Äîled by the game-changing Little Pepe (LILPEPE)‚Äîthat could deliver outsized returns and potentially mint the next wave of crypto wealth. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Next 5000% Moonshot? In the realm of presale tokens, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is stealing the spotlight with a potent mix of humor, high-performance tech, and unapologetic community spirit. While most memecoins stop at the meme, LILPEPE goes full throttle into infrastructure, launching its own Layer-2 blockchain aimed at scalability, speed, and zero transaction tax. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with over $2.5 million raised and more than 2.25 billion tokens sold, LILPEPE is gaining momentum rapidly. At $0.0013 per token, it offers ground-floor pricing for a project that experts speculate could surge over 7000% post-launch, especially if it captures even a fraction of the memecoin mania that lifted DOGE or SHIB. But LILPEPE isn‚Äôt just about early bird gains. It features: A supply of 100 billion tokens Zero tax on buys and sells Its own Layer-2 EVM chain built for meme utility No rug pulls, just green candles. And for those feeling lucky? LILPEPE is running a $777,000 giveaway , with $77,000 in tokens going to each of ten winners. Entry requires a minimum presale contribution of just $100 via the website littlepepe.com, where you can also complete social media tasks for bonus chances. With a clever story (‚ÄúPepe the OG‚Äôs heir fights high gas fees with dank memes‚Äù) and a roadmap that includes listings on top exchanges, influencer-driven virality, and staking rewards, LILPEPE isn‚Äôt just another frog in the pond‚Äîit‚Äôs the memecoin metamorphosis we didn‚Äôt know we needed. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Veteran Challenger Rebuilding for a Second Run Shiba Inu may already be a household name in the meme token world, but it‚Äôs far from done. After a brutal downtrend that saw SHIB shed a significant portion of its market cap, the token is showing signs of life, and technical analysts are eyeing a major breakout. Currently trading near $0.0000107, SHIB has formed a double bottom pattern ‚Äî a bullish signal that, historically, has preceded explosive moves. The neckline at $0.000017 is key. A confirmed breakout could push SHIB towards $0.0000283 or even $0.0000322 ‚Äî a gain of over 150% from current levels. Source: Tradingview With a strong community, continued development on Shibarium (its own Layer-2 solution), and aggressive marketing, SHIB remains one of the strongest meme narratives still in play. It may never hit $1, but even modest rebounds can generate huge profits in the world of fractions-of-a-penny tokens. Avalanche (AVAX): A Layer-1 Sleeping Giant Ready to Wake Up Unlike the meme-heavy picks on this list, Avalanche (AVAX) is a fundamentally strong Layer-1 network. But don‚Äôt let that fool you ‚Äî AVAX could deliver Doge-like returns for one simple reason: its valuation doesn‚Äôt reflect its growth. AVAX is powering millions of daily transactions, with growing traction in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Analysts see a massive wedge pattern forming on long-term charts ‚Äî the kind that often leads to parabolic breakouts. With support holding strong and a bullish engulfing candle recently forming near $15.70, momentum is quietly building. Source: Tradingview If AVAX breaks out of the $19.50 resistance, the path toward $128 and beyond is open‚Äîa 500%+ gain in the medium term, with far more upside as the market recovers. Sui (SUI): The Hidden Gem Turning Heads with Technical Reversal SUI is the definition of an underrated gem. After being pushed down for months, it rallied off the $2.40 support level, a crucial Fibonacci level, and shot up to about $2.79. This move confirmed a falling wedge breakout, which is one of the most consistent patterns for reversing in the cryptocurrency market. On-chain data is even more encouraging. Whale wallets are accumulating, trading volume is up over 50%, and market cap is climbing. Analysts are targeting $4.50 to $6.20 as the next major resistance zones, representing a 60% to 120% upside from the current level. Source: Tradingview For investors seeking a token with strong fundamentals and technical momentum, SUI stands out as a notable choice. Don‚Äôt be surprised if it becomes one of the best performers of 2025. XRP: The OG Altcoin Poised for a Technical Explosion XRP may not be new, but it‚Äôs still one of the most misunderstood‚Äîand potentially explosive‚Äîaltcoins on the market. After years of legal woes, Ripple has weathered the SEC storm and is now showing bullish technical signs that hint at a big breakout Currently trading above $2.17, XRP is forming a falling wedge pattern, while indicators such as the MACD and Chaikin Money Flow are flashing green. A breakout above $2.25 could quickly send XRP to $2.69 and even retest $3.40, its previous yearly high.

Dogwifhat (WIF): The Solana-Based Memecoin with a Cult Following Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin within the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an attractive choice for crypto enthusiasts. After a sharp correction, WIF is stabilizing around $0.80. Analysts highlight resistance levels at $0.88 and $0.90, with a potential push to $0.95 if momentum continues to build. Active community engagement and Solana‚Äôs ecosystem support add to WIF‚Äôs appeal. Source: Tradingview Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Rebound Kid of 2025 FLOKI is back on the radar after a long decline. Prices just bounced back from a low of about $0.0000580 to about $0.0000745, and technical indicators show that a trend reversal is on the way. What makes this recovery significant is the volume confirmation and rising open interest, both signs of growing conviction among traders. FLOKI‚Äôs past rallies have been explosive, and with the memecoin market heating up again, this could be the beginning of another one. With bullish momentum building and meme excitement still strong, FLOKI may easily double or triple from here, especially if it returns to its previous highs. ApeCoin (APE): Low Price, High Potential Trading under $0.60, ApeCoin (APE) is one of the cheapest large-cap meme-related tokens in the market right now‚Äîand that alone makes it a magnet for value hunters. But it‚Äôs not just the price that‚Äôs attractive. Analysts are projecting 2025 targets of $1.49 to $1.62, representing a 150%+ upside. Bullish scenarios could see APE even hitting $2 if broader altcoin cycles kick in. With ties to the Bored Ape Yacht Club (one of the most iconic NFT brands in existence), APE has real brand equity‚Äîa rarity among memecoins. As NFTs and metaverse narratives return, APE could be one of the biggest comeback stories in the space. Final Thoughts: Which One‚Äôs the Next DOGE? Dogecoin‚Äôs rise was part meme, part madness, and all momentum. But the crypto landscape has evolved. Now, investors are looking for coins that not only entertain but also build infrastructure, community, and value.

Lee said that stablecoins are widely accepted not only in the digital world but also in the real world, and that developments in this area increase the value of blockchains such as Ethereum. According to Lee, stablecoins have reached a total market cap of $250 billion as of today, and growth in this area is still in its infancy. Stablecoin issuers earn interest on the collateral deposited (usually in US dollars), but this income is not yet shared with users. This makes the stablecoin business model very attractive to banks, payment companies, and large retailers. Stablecoin usage offers significant advantages for sellers, especially in terms of low transaction costs and eliminating risks such as ‚Äúchargeback‚Äù. It also provides access to a wide range of users who do not use credit cards. Lee said that 80% of stablecoin transaction volume occurs outside the US, with Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan accounting for 40% of this volume. He noted that USDT is traded above $1 in some countries and is even used in real estate transactions. Stating that the US government also adopted stablecoins due to two main structural benefits, Lee said that the first of these is the global dominance of the dollar: USD accounts for 27% of global GDP, 57% of the central bank reserves, 88% of liquid financial markets, It constitutes 100% of stablecoins. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Delivers Harsh Criticism for Surprise Altcoin He argued that as more assets are traded on the blockchain, demand for stablecoins will increase, which in turn will increase global demand for dollars. The second benefit is that stablecoins are now the 12th largest holder of US Treasury bonds, with Tether (USDT) holding more US bonds than even Germany. According to Lee, stablecoins are at the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù where financial services and crypto meet. New generations of users expect their banks to be crypto-friendly. This has led institutions like Robinhood, Circle, Coinbase, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to integrate cryptocurrencies into their balance sheets. In this context, assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are also expected to play an important role. Ethereum stands out as the layer-1 blockchain where the majority of stablecoins are minted. The majority of real-world assets (such as stablecoins, tokenized stocks, and real estate) are traded on Ethereum. Today, 30% of Ethereum network fees come from stablecoins. According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent‚Äôs prediction, the stablecoin market could exceed $2 trillion. This would mean a 10x increase in Ethereum‚Äôs network revenues. Lee noted that these developments present great opportunities not only for Ethereum (ETH) but also for other layer-1 projects like Solana (SOL) and companies that ‚Äúhold crypto in the treasury‚Äù that generate returns through staking. *This is not investment advice.

Successful Audit and Holders‚Äô Hype Put This Token on the Charts Path,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ruvi-ai-ruvi-overtake-avalanche-avax-successful-audit-and-holders-hype-put-this-token-on-the-charts-path/,"Avalanche (AVAX) has long been a standout in the cryptocurrency space, known for its speed, scalability, and resilience. Yet, it appears a new contender is preparing to rival its position at the top. Ruvi AI (RUVI) , with its combination of cutting-edge technology, utility-based functionality, and enthusiastic early backers, is shaping up to be a strong candidate to challenge AVAX. Fueling this momentum is Ruvi AI‚Äôs impressive presale achievements, including $2 million raised , over 170 million tokens sold , and a growing base of 1,700+ holders . Coupled with a successful audit and a clear focus on real-world applications , Ruvi AI is well on its way to carving out a top spot on the cryptocurrency charts. What Gives Ruvi AI the Edge Over Avalanche? The key to Ruvi AI‚Äôs growing popularity lies in its utility-driven approach . Where AVAX revolutionized crypto transactions by emphasizing speed and scalability, Ruvi AI adds further value by addressing challenges in major industries through its blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) integration . This adds a unique, problem-solving angle that few projects can rival. Real-World Applications Driving Demand Ruvi AI creates tangible value by solving real-world issues across the following industries: Marketing : Businesses can use Ruvi AI‚Äôs AI-powered tools to refine ad targeting, optimize campaign effectiveness, and reduce wasted ad spending. This makes marketing efforts more efficient and impactful. Entertainment : Content creators benefit from blockchain-backed payment solutions, ensuring secure monetization. Meanwhile, AI-driven insights help them better connect with audiences and increase engagement. Finance : Ruvi AI enhances transaction transparency and fraud detection while simplifying operational processes for financial institutions. With practical use cases across diverse sectors, Ruvi AI ensures consistent demand for its token, differentiating itself from projects that rely purely on speculative hype. A Presale That Signals Big Things to Come One of the strongest indicators of Ruvi AI‚Äôs potential is its presale success. Here are a few standout numbers: $2 million raised , reflecting strong investor confidence. Over 170 million tokens sold , demonstrating a robust market response. A growing 1,700+ holder community , showing increasing adoption and engagement. Such accomplishments suggest a strong foundation for Ruvi AI‚Äôs future performance, catching the attention of seasoned investors and analysts alike. Growth Trajectory and ROI Potential Ruvi AI stands out with its predictable growth model , an attribute that many other cryptocurrencies lack. Currently priced at $0.015 per token during Phase 2 presale , Ruvi AI offers a low-risk entry point for investors. Post-presale, the token will see its price increase to $0.07 , guaranteeing an almost 5x return for early buyers. Analysts forecast even better returns after its listing, with a predicted value of $1 per token , equating to a 66x ROI . By taking advantage of Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP investment tiers, profits could scale even higher. Unlock Maximum Gains With VIP Tiers Ruvi AI rewards early backers with VIP investment tiers that offer notable bonuses, significantly amplifying profits. Here‚Äôs how they break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers not only reward early adopters but also showcase the immense profit potential Ruvi AI provides at its current valuation. Transparency and Security as Catalysts for Growth Transparency and security are pivotal in building trust among crypto investors, and Ruvi AI has ensured both. The project has successfully undergone a third-party audit by CyberScope , which validated the safety of its smart contracts. Meanwhile, Ruvi AI‚Äôs partnership with the WEEX Exchange ensures post-presale liquidity , enabling seamless token trading and boosting investor confidence. These initiatives separate Ruvi AI from its peers, making it one of the most reliable opportunities in a growing market. Can Ruvi AI Overtake Avalanche? While Avalanche‚Äôs track record is undeniably impressive, Ruvi AI‚Äôs utility-driven roadmap, tangible real-world applications, and transparent operations give it the potential to rival and perhaps even surpass AVAX in the long run. Starting at a price of $0.015 , with a guaranteed increase to $0.07 , and a forecasted value of $1 , Ruvi AI offers unparalleled ROI opportunities. With $2 million raised , over 170 million tokens sold , and a rapidly growing supporter base, Ruvi AI is proving that it has all the ingredients for sustained success.

46977587,https://thecoinrise.com/gemini-rolls-out-tokenized-stock-trading-in-eu/,1751144409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/46977587.jpeg,Gemini Rolls Out Tokenized Stock Trading in EU,https://thecoinrise.com/gemini-rolls-out-tokenized-stock-trading-in-eu/,"Gemini, a well-known crypto exchange, has recently introduced tokenized shares of Strategy (MSTR) to its European Union (EU) users. These tokenized shares are backed by fundamental U.S. equities, giving investors the same financial benefits as owning traditional stocks. This marks the beginning of a larger plan to bring U.S. securities to the blockchain, making them more accessible to people worldwide. Gemini Unveils A New Way to Invest in U.S. Stocks Gemini‚Äôs tokenized MSTR shares are made possible through a partnership with Dinari, a tokenization platform. These shares are turned into tokens on the blockchain but are backed by actual U.S. stocks. This would allow users to buy small portions of shares using their cryptocurrency wallets . At launch, MSTR tokens will be available on the Arbitrum (ARB) network, which offers fast and low-cost transactions. Gemini has also announced that it will soon add support for additional networks, making the tokenized stocks even more accessible. Breaking Barriers with Tokenized Stocks This new offering is designed to make investing in U.S. stocks easier for people around the world. In many countries, users face challenges such as the high cost of converting local currency to U.S. dollars and the difficulty of opening a brokerage account. However, by turning stocks into blockchain tokens, Gemini aims to open up access to the U.S. market. These tokenized shares enable users to purchase small portions of a stock, making it more affordable to invest. Unlike traditional stock markets, these tokens can be traded 24/7 and settle quickly on the blockchain, reducing delays and fees. These tokens also give holders the same financial rights as regular shares, if allowed by law. Gemini Says More Tokenized Stocks on the Way Gemini said MSTR is just the beginning. The company, which is planning to go public , aims to add more tokenized stocks and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) shortly. Its goal is to export U.S. equities globally, enabling people everywhere to participate in financial markets without borders. This move is part of a larger effort to update old financial systems by using blockchain to manage and settle trades faster and more efficiently. Gemini is one of the few major exchanges bringing tokenized stocks to compliance-focused regions. This launch occurs as more financial institutions explore how to utilize digital asset networks for settling and holding traditional securities. As more people seek flexible, global investment options, Gemini‚Äôs tokenized stocks could help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the world of crypto. Experts also predict that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization could grow to over $600 billion in assets under management by 2030.

Analysts are increasingly confident in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term trajectory, citing network upgrades, developer activity, and protocol integrations as strong drivers behind the Ethereum price prediction 2030. Technical indicators are mixed in the short term, with moving averages trending down and RSI signaling neutrality, but broader sentiment remains optimistic. Nearly 40% of participants describe themselves as ‚Äúvery bullish‚Äù on ETH, and forecasts project a potential price of $3,070 by the end of the decade based on modest compound growth and continued adoption. But while Ethereum steadily paves its long-term path, Qubetics is preparing for an immediate leap forward. With its final presale stage nearly complete, the protocol is just days away from getting listed on one of the world‚Äôs top 10 exchanges, an event expected to trigger an automatic 20% price increase. Positioned as the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator and offering one of the most developer-friendly toolkits in the space, Qubetics is emerging as a serious contender among this cycle‚Äôs top opportunities. The question isn‚Äôt whether to join, but whether you‚Äôll get in before the last tokens are gone. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Network Activity and Upgrade Impact Ethereum‚Äôs network fundamentals remain healthy, with developer activity, smart contract deployments, DeFi usage, and NFT minting, continuing at elevated levels. Past upgrade cycles, such as the Merge and EIP‚Äë1559 burn mechanisms, have shown that supply pressure and staking incentives can reinforce ETH‚Äôs value. As decentralised finance and on‚Äëchain applications grow, those foundations may support a steady climb toward the $3,000+ zone by 2030. Thus our Ethereum price prediction 2030 scenario hinges on sustained on‚Äëchain demand and evolving staking utility. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Sentiment Meets Scenarios Projection models assume a 5‚ÄØpercent near‚Äëterm rise, echoing user‚Äëentered forecasts that place ETH near $2,407 within days of now. Continuing from that base, analysts envision ETH reaching $2,525 in 2026, $2,652 in 2027, $2,784 in 2028, and anchoring around $3,070 in 2030. Community sentiment, leaning bullish, underpins these outlooks. In these narratives, Ethereum‚Äôs smart‚Äëcontract dominance and network effect work hand in hand toward our long‚Äëterm Ethereum price prediction 2030 target. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Risk Factors and Strategic View That said, macro headwinds, regulatory pressures, competition from layer‚Äë1 rivals, and potential staking lock‚Äëups, remain key risks. Short‚Äëterm trends could remain flat or modestly negative without new catalyst events or partnerships. Yet even under cautious assumptions, Ethereum‚Äôs path toward that $3,000+ horizon by 2030 remains plausible, given present fundamentals and ecosystem momentum underlying our Ethereum price prediction 2030 scenario. Ethereum Price Prediction 2030: Community and Participation Dynamics Beyond raw price forecasts, Ethereum‚Äôs future will hinge on its community members, developers, and early adopters. On‚Äëchain governance, DeFi protocols, and roll‚Äëup ecosystems all contribute to sustained momentum and value creation. As the protocol matures, its capacity for innovation may amplify the outlook baked into Ethereum price prediction 2030 estimates. Qubetics: Web3 Aggregated Access and IDE Tools Discover Qubetics , the world‚Äôs first web3 aggregator uniting top blockchains under a single interface. It provides two powerful application layers: QubeQode, which delivers drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop components for user authentication, token management, and storage integration; and Qubetics IDE offering form‚Äëbased contract setup and a pre‚Äëwritten code repository, simplifying blockchain integration for developers and non‚Äëtechnical users alike. Imagine a small‚Äëbusiness owner needing a customer rewards token: with QubeQode‚Äôs visual components and IDE‚Äôs form configuration, they deploy a tokenized loyalty program in hours rather than weeks, reducing complexity and accelerating time to value. Qubetics Presale Opportunity Qubetics presale is now in its final public phase (Stage 37), with $TICS priced at $0.3370. Over $18.1‚ÄØmillion raised, more than 28,300 token holders and 516‚ÄØmillion $TICS tokens have been sold. Only 9‚ÄØmillion $TICS tokens remain at this fixed rate before listing. The public sale allocation has surged to 38.55‚ÄØpercent under a streamlined supply of just 1.36‚ÄØbillion tokens, driving scarcity and community‚Äëled governance ahead of a listing price at $0.40 that implies a 20‚ÄØpercent instant return on entry. Serving as a contender for the best crypto presale, this phase grants early buyers real ownership in protocol direction. Analysts highlight limited token supply against growing demand as major catalysts. Listing on a top‚Äë10 global exchange will trigger pricing at $0.40, unlocking immediate ROI and further upside as $TICS gains utility across Qubetics‚Äô multi‚Äëchain aggregation platform. This crypto presale is structured not only for early-stage value but also for long-term scalability. An investor entering with $5,000 at $0.3370 would secure approximately 14,850 $TICS tokens. Upon listing, those tokens become worth $5,940, delivering a $940 gain at 20‚ÄØpercent ROI. If $TICS reaches $5 to $10 in a broader market cycle, such an investment could swell to $74,250 to $148,500. Conclusion Ethereum‚Äôs long‚Äëterm trajectory, anchored in technical signals, network fundamentals, and community sentiment, supports an Ethereum price prediction 2030 of around $3,070. Meanwhile, Qubetics presale presents one of the best crypto presale opportunities today, offering scarcity, community alignment, functional developer tools, and clear listing upside. Act now to join this best crypto presale and gain exposure to Qubetics‚Äô final token distribution, while Ethereum continues on its path toward future growth.

Strong Support Signals a Potential Reversal XRP is currently consolidating above a crucial support zone between $2.00 and $2.10‚Äîa range that coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from its February‚ÄìApril rally. This level, often referred to as the ‚Äúgolden ratio,‚Äù is widely recognized in technical analysis as a prime area for trend reversals. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which sits just below at around $2.00, is also providing dynamic support. In the chart shared by Captain Redbeard, XRP appears to be forming a double bottom, a classic bullish reversal pattern , right above this support band. This structure, if confirmed by a breakout above $2.40‚Äì$2.50 resistance, could mark the beginning of a major upward move. $XRP is ready to bounce from here.. Next stop: $10 ‚Äî see you there! pic.twitter.com/aOKT3Zgyso ‚Äî Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) June 28, 2025 Technical Indicators Turn Bullish Several technical indicators are reinforcing the bullish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is gradually climbing toward the 60 level, showing a recovery in momentum after recent selling pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is on the verge of a bullish crossover, further hinting that XRP could be preparing for a rally. Volume trends also support this view. Selling pressure has declined significantly on recent dips, while buying volume is slowly picking up, suggesting accumulation by long-term investors. A clean break above the 0.382 Fibonacci resistance at $2.46 would likely confirm bullish control and open the way to retesting the $2.80‚Äì$3.00 zone. Macro Factors and Institutional Momentum XRP‚Äôs technical strength is being reinforced by favorable macro and fundamental developments. Ripple‚Äôs strategic advancements are boosting confidence in the long-term value of the XRP Ledger. Additionally, the growing global interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization plays directly into XRP‚Äôs core use case as a liquidity and settlement asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader market sentiment has also improved, with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling a more dovish stance and institutions showing increased appetite for digital asset exposure. These factors are creating a more supportive environment for altcoins like XRP. $10 Target: A Long-Term Vision with Growing Traction While Captain Redbeard‚Äôs $10 target may seem ambitious, it reflects a growing belief among XRP proponents that a combination of regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and network utility could eventually drive a massive rally. Historically, XRP has shown it‚Äôs capable of rapid parabolic moves under the right conditions, as seen in 2017 and again in early 2021. For now, XRP‚Äôs ability to hold the $2.00 support and break above nearby resistance levels remains the immediate focus. If bulls succeed, Redbeard‚Äôs forecast could mark the start of XRP‚Äôs next major leg up, and possibly its journey to a two-digit valuation.

During this period, the popular altcoin and a major headliner in the present market cycle has traded as low as $2.35, which is a 56.44% decline from its all-time high of $5.35 in January. Amidst this mayhem, prominent market expert with X pseudonym PlanD has stated the ongoing formation of a bullish dual pattern hints at an incoming explosive price gain in the SUI market. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims $2,500 In Squeeze-Driven Rally ‚Äì But Can It Hold? Technical Combo Sets Stage for SUI Surge ‚Äì Analyst In an X post on June 27, PlanD shares an interesting price analysis that reveals the formation of two bullish patterns ‚Äì the bull pennant and the inverse head and shoulder (H&S) ‚Äì on the SUI daily chart. Both patterns currently form a confluence of technical indicators suggesting the altcoin is preparing for a major price rally as the second half of 2025 approaches. The inverse head and shoulder pattern is a common bullish reversal pattern. Amidst SUI‚Äôs price correction in Q1, the altcoin formed the left shoulder at $2.42 in February and head at $1.74 in April with a recent price bounce off $2.62 appearing to form the right shoulder. PlanD describes $2.62 as a critical support level in this bullish set-up, the validity of which ensures a potential price breakout. In studying PlanD‚Äôs technical analysis, the inverse H&S currently has a neckline of $4.25, breaking past which confirms the bullish price reversal with a price target set at $10.74. Meanwhile, The bull pennant is a common chart pattern marked by a strong price uptrend (flagpole), followed by a descending channel (pennant) that precedes a price breakout similar to the length of the flagpole.

While ADA trading at $0.58, continues to attract long-term capital thanks to its steady development, it‚Äôs Mutuum Finance that‚Äôs fueling real excitement right now. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 50% is already sold out because of huge demand. The project is priced at $0.03. Over $11.3 million has been raised to date and over 12,600 investors have joined. Mutuum Finance is emerging as a serious coin, with projections from community analysts pointing to possible 100x gains by year-end, if momentum continues. If you‚Äôre still wondering what to buy before June ends, this is one token you‚Äôll want on your radar before it becomes a headline. Cardano Holds Steady Near $0.58 as Whale Support Solidifies The trading price of Cardano (ADA) currently stands at $0.5818 and has rebounded after a short drop to as low as $0.56 as the trading volume rises indicating that the bigger players are entering the market to support the price. Still keeping investors at bay as its ADA stays within its limits is the recent Leios update of the network, a feature aimed to boost throughput and scalability. Some trading analysts observe the formation of a bullish technical pattern around this point which may precondition a breakout up to $1.65 in case the support remains strong. With capital flows changing and traders rethinking their portfolio, there is an increasing number of people looking at new DeFi-oriented opportunities, one of which is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Breaks the $11.3 Million Mark Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is well on its path to being one of the hottest projects in DeFi. With an astonishing $11.3 million raised and over 12,600 investors already joining, the presale is gaining serious traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already determined official launch price of $0.06, early investors already enjoy a 100% profit before the token is even available for sale. Some even foresee a post-launch price bounce of more than $2.50 before the bull run of 2025 is finished. Adaptive Intelligence Borrowing, a Newly Unlocked DeFi Transaction Security Mutuum Finance is reshaping DeFi with a lending platform built on user control, security, and flexibility. Its two-sided model encourages diverse interactions instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all approach. Investors of the programs with USDT can passively earn heightened income as the interest rates are modified according to the market tendency of Peer-to-Contract without making any direct operation. Trustless, automated, and customizable, Mutuum Finance offers a new standard in DeFi lending, automation without sacrificing control. Mutuum Finance Announces $50,000 Bug Bounty To reinforce security, Mutuum has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK, with rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low, ensuring every vulnerability is addressed. Cardano may be holding firm with whale support near $0.58, but it‚Äôs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that‚Äôs capturing the real alpha-driven attention right now. With over $11.3 million raised and more than 12,600 investors on board in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM is quickly moving from under-the-radar to must-watch status. Priced at just $0.03, early buyers are positioned for up to 2x gains before launch, and analysts are eyeing 100x potential by year-end. As whale capital starts rotating into high-upside DeFi plays, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Secure your spot before the next price jump.

However, many Dogecoin holders are now taking notice of Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a next-generation token set for massive returns with real-world utility and significant growth potential. Having already raised $2 million and sold over 170 million tokens , Ruvi AI‚Äôs rapid progress positions it as a compelling alternative for serious investors. Why Dogecoin Holders Are Eyeing Ruvi AI Dogecoin‚Äôs lack of utility has been its Achilles‚Äô heel, relying heavily on social media hype for price momentum. Ruvi AI, by contrast, is built to solve relevant, real-world problems through the integration of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) . It offers smart, scalable solutions across industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance , positioning it as a utility-driven token capable of sustained growth. Another reason for Ruvi AI‚Äôs increasing popularity is its structured growth model.

33767162,[object Object],1751148021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitwise Updates Spot Dogecoin ETF Filing: Will A DOGE Approval Come Before An XRP ETF?,https://bitcoinist.com/spot-dogecoin-etf-filing/,"Bitwise has updated its spot Dogecoin ETF filing, providing optimism that the crypto fund could launch soon. Based on Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart‚Äôs prediction, the XRP ETFs are still expected to launch before the DOGE ETFs. Bitwise Amends S-1 For Spot Dogecoin ETF According to a SEC filing , the asset manager has filed an amended registration statement for its spot Dogecoin ETF . This has increased optimism that the SEC could soon approve this fund. In an X post , Balchunas stated that the amendment is a good sign as it indicates that Bitwise is engaging with the Commission. The Bloomberg analyst further remarked that the amendment also tracks with other spot approvals. Meanwhile, he revealed that a huge change that Bitwise made to the spot Dogecoin ETF filing is the addition of in-kind creations and redemptions. This ETF mechanism enables authorized participants (APs) to create and redeem shares using DOGE instead of cash. Balchunas noted that this provision wasn‚Äôt initially there when Bitwise filed for a spot Dogecoin ETF in January. The analyst also declared that it is a ‚Äúnear lock‚Äù at this point that in-kind will be allowed in spot ETFs across the board. Besides Bitwise, asset managers 21Shares and Grayscale have also filed to offer a Dogecoin ETF. Earlier in the month, 21Shares had filed an amended S-1 for its spot DOGE ETF. Back then, Eric Balchunas stated that the amendment made things maybe even more interesting. He noted how amendments are typically filed after comments from the SEC. As such, there is the possibility that the Commission has given feedback to two prospective DOGE ETF issuers. Grayscale is the only spot Dogecoin ETF issuer that has yet to file an amended registration statement. However, that could change soon if indeed the SEC is providing comments to these issuers. This would be similar to how all the prospective Solana ETF issuers amended their S-1 filings after the Commission asked them to do so. Will the SEC Approve the DOGE ETFs Before the XRP ETFs? Balchunas and Seyffart predict that the SEC is unlikely to approve the spot Dogecoin ETFs before the XRP ETFs. These Bloomberg analysts recently raised their odds of approval for an XRP ETF in 2025 to 95%. Meanwhile, they predict that there is a 90% chance that the Commission will approve a DOGE ETF this year. Factors like the fact that XRP has a regulated futures market through the CME put the XRP ETFs above the Dogecoin ETFs. Seven asset managers have filed for an XRP ETF, compared to three for DOGE. The XRP Lawsuit is also coming to an end, which is another positive development. However, it is worth noting that the XRP and Dogecoin ETFs both have a final SEC deadline of October 17, which means they could be approved on the same day. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.16, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Dogecoin|21Shares|APs|Authorized Participants|Bitwise|Bloomberg Intelligence|CME|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin ETFs|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Eric Balchunas|Grayscale|James Seyffart|solana|Solana ETFs|US SEC|XRP ETFs,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-28 22:00:21

But in 2025, smart choices depend on a project‚Äôs long-term plan, strong backing, and real use cases. It‚Äôs no longer about following the loudest voice; it‚Äôs about finding the altcoins that can deliver. In this blog, you‚Äôll explore four standout altcoins that are doing just that: BlockDAG, Cosmos, Polygon, and Algorand. Each project shows a clear purpose and strong progress, making them worth a closer look. Keep reading to see how these projects are building value and why they belong on your list of the best altcoins to buy now. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Why $325M Raised Supports Real Growth BlockDAG tops this list not due to hype but because of the clear need behind its funding. The project has now raised $325 million, aiming for a $600 million goal. This is powering a major rollout, including 20+ centralised exchange listings, ASIC miner delivery, and a growing developer rewards system. Batch 29 is now open, priced at $0.0276, with 23.3 billion coins sold. Buyers from Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% return. There is a special offer for a limited time at $0.0080. BlockDAG is building a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) system. This design supports faster transactions and fits perfectly with future DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure) and AI-based networks. Other projects may rely on flashy promises. BlockDAG is funding real tech, hardware, on-chain features, and liquidity. This makes it one of the best altcoins to buy now for those looking at long-term potential and real utility, not just another marketing splash. 2. Cosmos (ATOM): Practical Blockchain Interoperability Cosmos earns its place as one of the best altcoins to buy now thanks to its strong Layer-0 role. Instead of competing with Ethereum or Bitcoin, Cosmos connects blockchains through its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Developers can create app-specific chains that still interact easily with other chains. Cosmos focuses on flexibility, not control. It works with chains like Terra, Secret Network, and Osmosis, offering a modular solution that many projects now seek. In today‚Äôs crowded Layer-1 market, Cosmos‚Äô horizontal scaling approach stands out. As more developers embrace multi-chain projects, Cosmos‚Äô framework becomes more valuable. It‚Äôs a practical and forward-thinking choice for anyone looking at the best altcoins to buy now with long-term utility. 3.

46982228,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=779424,1751151610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46982228.jpeg,Bitcoin And Ethereum Coinbase Premium Remains Positive For 7 Weeks ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-coinbase-premium-positive-seven-weeks/,"The cryptocurrency market ‚Äî specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum ‚Äî has performed quite well in the second quarter of 2025, which is a stark contrast to the first quarter‚Äôs performance. The premier cryptocurrency capitalized on this bullish momentum, jumping to a new all-time high above the $111,000 mark. Similarly, the price of Ethereum started its own resurgence and reclaimed the $2,000 mark in early May, albeit the altcoin has been stuck in a consolidation range over the past month. Despite the brewing market uncertainty due to the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to stay afloat. US Investors Keep Crypto Prices Afloat In a new post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed that United States investors have been active in the market over the past few weeks. The crypto analyst explained that this correlates with the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices withstanding bearish pressure in recent weeks. Related Reading: You Won‚Äôt Believe Who‚Äôs Moving Millions in Bitcoin on Binance Right Now This on-chain observation is based on the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks the difference between the crypto prices on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and global Binance exchange (USDT pair). This metric reflects the sentiment of the US institutional entities (the major players on Coinbase) compared to those on global exchanges. Typically, when the price premium on Coinbase has a positive value, it implies increasing demand from US investors, who are willing to spend more than other global investors to buy cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum, in this case). On the flip side, the Coinbase Premium Index falling beneath the zero mark signals that US investors are buying less compared to the global traders. According to Kesmeci, the Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index (excluding the abrupt dip in BTC on May 29) has been in the positive territory since May 9, 2024. This 47-day streak suggests high buying activity from US institutional investors despite geopolitical tensions. Kesmeci added: In the U.S., institutional investors and Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF investors (except for Fidelity) continue their heavy purchases through Coinbase (and have been for weeks). This is why Coinbase Premiums are showing strong positive momentum. Because of this (in my opinion), despite the crises, we haven‚Äôt seen a sharp drop in Bitcoin or Ethereum in the market. In essence, the on-chain analyst believes the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have been able to weather the storm with the rising tensions in Asia because US investors have been active in the market. Naturally, risk assets tend to succumb to bearish pressure during unstable conditions like wars, global pandemics, and so on. Bitcoin & Ethereum Price As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $107,100, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Ether token is valued at around $2,420, with a mere 0.6% price jump in the past day.

As the blockchain landscape rapidly changes, some coins exhibit exceptional potential. This article reveals 5 promising cryptocurrencies that could be crucial for wealth creation, offering insights for those aiming to seize this financial opportunity. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price.

XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a ‚Äúmoonshot opportunity.‚Äù More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it‚Äôs working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high.

Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won‚Äôt last forever‚Äîso if you‚Äôre interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong options, but XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as the first sports memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth with its unique blend of memes and sports.

Here‚Äôs why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-set-for-700-price-rally-heres-why/,"Renowned market analyst EGRAG Crypto has identified technical signals suggesting that XRP could rise significantly in the near term. Drawing from historical patterns, EGRAG now projects a potential surge to $17.5, citing similarities between XRP‚Äôs current price behavior and its movements during previous bullish cycles. His latest technical analysis places particular focus on XRP‚Äôs interaction with the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator often used by traders to evaluate trend strength and momentum shifts. The Role of the 21-Week EMA in Past XRP Rallies According to EGRAG, XRP‚Äôs price trajectory during the 2020‚Äì2021 market cycle shows parallels with current market conditions. In early 2020, the token dropped below the 21-week EMA, eventually bottoming out at approximately $0.1140 in March of that year. For 19 consecutive weeks, the EMA acted as a major resistance level. #XRP ‚Äì Why $17.5 Is a Simple Yet Powerful Target! : Looking back at the 2021 cycle, many underestimated #XRP ‚Äôs massive Pumps but the numbers tell a different story. By examining the percentage moves from various pumps in relation to the Exponential Moving Average (EMA),‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/19F9gR30sZ ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 25, 2025 That resistance was finally broken in July 2020, leading to a strong rally that saw XRP climb to $0.79 by November. This represented an increase of over 590% from the cycle low. However, the asset faced resistance again at that peak and entered a multi-week consolidation phase. During the consolidation, XRP maintained close interaction with the 21-week EMA , which had shifted from resistance to support. This stability at the EMA set the stage for another surge in early 2021, when the asset climbed from a February low of $0.3684 to a high of $1.96 by April. This move marked an increase of roughly 432%. EGRAG emphasized that many observers had underestimated XRP‚Äôs strength during that cycle. However, the data demonstrated otherwise. Current Market Structure Mirrors Previous Cycle In his recent analysis, EGRAG notes that XRP is again showing behavior similar to what was observed in the 2020‚Äì2021 period. The token broke above the 21-week EMA in November 2024, following a market-wide uptrend driven by broader macro events. From a base of $0.50, XRP surged to $3.40, reflecting a gain of 580%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A corrective phase followed in February 2025, placing XRP in a consolidation zone where it has frequently tested the 21-week EMA as support, mirroring the pattern seen in late 2020. EGRAG now anticipates that this consolidation will precede a new rally, similar to the second wave observed in 2021. He predicts that XRP could rise as high as $17.5 during this next leg, which would represent an increase of nearly 695% from its valuation of $2.20 (at the time of prediction). This projection is based on analyzing previous rallies about the asset‚Äôs behavior around the 21-week EMA. Market Sentiment and Timing Considerations At the time of reporting, XRP is trading at approximately $2.13, showing a weekly gain of 5.42% after recovering from recent price volatility. When asked to provide a specific timeframe for the anticipated surge, EGRAG cautioned against attempts to precisely predict timing. Instead, he stressed the importance of understanding broader market trends and technical signals. EGRAG Crypto‚Äôs analysis presents a technically grounded case for a possible XRP rally to $17.5, based on well-established patterns and historical market behavior. While price movements in crypto markets remain highly unpredictable, the consistency between past and present structures adds weight to the possibility of significant upward momentum for XRP in the coming months.

Each of these tokens rides a unique wave, from oracle integrations and proof-of-stake scalability to multi-chain wallet technology. But only one of them is in the final stages of a presale that‚Äôs already sold more than half a billion tokens. Qubetics ($TICS) is not just another token. It addresses a long-standing pain point in the crypto world‚Äîthe lack of seamless interoperability, cross-chain transactions, and user-controlled privacy. At the core of its promise is a non-custodial multi-chain wallet that makes switching between blockchains feel like navigating tabs in a browser. And as this emerging platform gears up for a major exchange listing at $0.40, it is becoming one of the top cryptos to invest in this week. Qubetics Wallet Tech Makes It a Major Contender Among Top Cryptos to Invest in This Week As blockchain users demand smoother, safer, and more autonomous control over their digital assets, Qubetics enters the frame with a solution long overdue‚Äîa fully decentralised, non-custodial multi-chain wallet built for both beginners and experienced Web3 users. Picture this: a design studio in Brooklyn using Solana-based NFTs to verify ownership of their art while collaborating with a dev team on Polygon. Normally, that would involve several apps, wallets, and exchange interfaces. With Qubetics‚Äô wallet, these actions happen inside one platform, with the added bonus of private key ownership and zero central oversight. Now imagine a fintech firm in Toronto running multiple stablecoins across BNB, Ethereum, and Stellar‚ÄîQubetics streamlines the chaos with one click swaps, built-in bridge technology, and cold-storage grade security. As interoperability becomes the backbone of next-gen DeFi and dApp expansion, Qubetics makes its mark by integrating cross-chain compatibility, zero-knowledge proof security, and permissionless control under one clean UI. For participants seeking the top cryptos to invest in this week , the ability to unify multiple chains into one controllable interface is a compelling differentiator. Why the Qubetics Presale Is Drawing Attention from Across the Ecosystem With over $18.1 million raised, more than 516 million $TICS tokens sold, and 28,300 holders already onboard, the Qubetics presale has become one of the most anticipated token sales of the year. Currently in Stage 37 and priced at $0.3370, the presale is inching closer to its conclusion, as less than 9 million tokens remain at this level. A full supply reduction from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion tokens, with 38.55% allocated to the public, sets a clear tone of scarcity and measured growth. The platform has already demonstrated strong demand. A participant contributing $5,500 at the current price would receive around 16,323 tokens. If $TICS hits $1 post-listing, that $5,500 becomes $16,323. But if $TICS scales to $5, that same bag grows to over $81,615. And should the token push to $10 or $15 during the next cycle, the holdings could be worth $163,230 or $244,845 respectively. For those looking to enter before the wider market does, Qubetics is making a hard case as one of the top cryptos to invest in this week. What really draws attention is the upcoming exchange debut. Analysts suggest a 20% price increase upon listing on a top 10 global exchange, sparking a potential momentum shift. With the Qubetics presale closing in, and token access soon shifting entirely to the open market, the urgency among early adopters is accelerating fast. Key Launch Milestones to Watch Public Sale End: June 30, 8 AM UTC Exchange Listing: June 30, 11 AM UTC Launch Price: $0.40 With these milestones set, and the infrastructure already battle-tested, the Qubetics presale now represents one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities available. It‚Äôs not just a speculative asset‚Äîit‚Äôs a functioning utility token inside a working Web3 environment. Chainlink Secures Its Place with Real-World Oracle Power Chainlink (LINK) has long operated as the go-to name for decentralized data infrastructure. But recent activity suggests that the project is evolving beyond simple oracle services and into the broader domain of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, institutional finance, and DeFi composability. In June, Chainlink announced new integrations with Avalanche and Base, enhancing cross-chain interoperability for dApps that rely on external data feeds. Additionally, its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is now being explored by traditional banks and payment networks to bridge the gap between blockchain-native and real-world finance. This expansion mirrors the goals of SWIFT‚Äôs experiments with Chainlink‚Äôs technology, which have quietly advanced behind the scenes. With continued upgrades to staking models and new enterprise partnerships underway, LINK is beginning to reassert itself not only as a vital infrastructure layer but also as a token with strong upside potential. While Qubetics handles user control and UX optimization, Chainlink provides backend data plumbing that DeFi simply can‚Äôt run without. For anyone scanning the horizon for the top cryptos to invest in this week, LINK‚Äôs comeback momentum is worth noting. SUI Is Rising Thanks to Developer Growth and Network Expansion SUI is not a household name yet, but it‚Äôs quickly becoming one in dev circles. Born from Mysten Labs, SUI uses the Move language and focuses on horizontal scaling, enabling massive throughput and fast settlement times. That matters a lot when developers are building high-volume apps that cannot tolerate lag or congestion. Over the past 30 days, SUI has seen a 22% rise in active developers and a 17% increase in wallet registrations. New gaming and DeFi projects are onboarding fast, and the network‚Äôs gas efficiency is making it particularly appealing to builders experimenting with NFTs, payments, and social dApps. A recent uptick in trading volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) signals that the chain is entering a new stage of adoption. While it lacks the name recognition of Ethereum or even Solana, SUI‚Äôs underlying tech is being noticed for its performance. The chain‚Äôs bullish chart activity coincides with growing TVL, suggesting organic growth rather than hype cycles. This makes SUI a serious candidate for anyone evaluating the top cryptos to invest in this week from a long-term innovation standpoint. Final Thoughts: Which One‚Äôs the Right Pick Among the Top Cryptos to Invest in This Week? Each of the three tokens covered here offers something different. Chainlink powers the data infrastructure that lets smart contracts do their job. SUI builds out a scalable, efficient layer for next-gen dApps. And Qubetics? It tackles a critical issue with blockchain usability‚Äîinteroperability and control‚Äîby offering a wallet that bridges ecosystems without giving up security or decentralization. Yet, the Qubetics presale has a uniquely timed advantage. With a launch price of $0.40, an anticipated 20% listing bump, and a presale tally now over $18.1 million, this may be the best crypto presale currently live. Participants getting in before the June 30 cutoff will be ahead of the wider exchange exposure. While LINK and SUI are solid plays backed by working ecosystems, Qubetics combines utility, urgency, and upside, making it a strong contender among the top cryptos to invest in this week.

As a result, the 14th-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization is eyeing a bullish run to the psychological price of $17. Market analyst Tektonic pointed out, ‚ÄúThe price structure indicates the formation of a potential continuation pattern, with $13.50 acting as immediate resistance. A confirmed breakout above this level could open the path toward the $14.50‚Äì$15.00 region in the short term.‚Äù Source: Tektonic LINK is building a strong base at the $13.15 zone, which might ignite the fire needed to hit the $15 price target. Chainlink and Mastercard Partnership Seeks to Bridge the Gap Between Traditional Finance and Crypto Mastercard and Chainlink recently partnered to launch Swapper Finance, enabling users to buy crypto directly from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with any Mastercard. This groundbreaking partnership marked the first time any crypto can be purchased on-chain using traditional cards. As a result, Mastercard‚Äôs 3.5 billion cardholders will have the opportunity to buy crypto directly on Uniswap, thanks to instant, secure crypto-to-fiat conversion. Therefore, the Chainlink and Mastercard collaboration seamlessly bridges DeFi with mainstream and traditional finance (TradFi). Meanwhile, Chainlink launched the ‚ÄòBuild on Solana‚Äô program last month to accelerate Web3 development on Solana through targeted ecosystem incentives and expert technical support. By merging Solana‚Äôs high-speed performance with Chainlink‚Äôs powerful oracles, the program intends to boost scalability and efficiency for apps in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs.

The six-time NBA champion recently disclosed his crypto watchlist, spotlighting Shiba Inu (SHIB) and XRP among his top choices for the anticipated bull cycle. Amidst ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market, many investors and public figures have begun publicly identifying tokens they believe have strong potential for gains shortly. Pippen‚Äôs selections add to the growing discussion surrounding altcoins that may outperform during the next rally. SHIB and XRP Lead Pippen‚Äôs Altcoin Focus Alongside Bitcoin, which remains the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Pippen mentioned that he is watching several altcoins he believes could perform strongly. These include Shiba Inu and XRP, which he considers standout assets going into the bull market. He also noted his interest in Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Game5Ball. Besides Bitcoin, what coins are you watching this BULL run? I got my picks, $ETH $SOL $BNB $XRP $Ball aka @Game5Ball $ADA $DOGE $SHIB $LINK What else you got? Drop your crypto picks. ‚Äî Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) June 27, 2025 This diverse list suggests Pippen is considering both established altcoins and emerging projects in his market outlook. Previous Support for XRP and Shiba Inu Pippen‚Äôs interest in XRP and SHIB is not new. Earlier this year, he publicly expressed confidence in XRP‚Äôs future, indicating that he views the asset as a strong candidate for long-term growth. His endorsement stirred discussion among his followers, with some speculating that XRP may even outperform Ethereum during the next bull run, expected in 2025. In May, Pippen reiterated his bullish stance on Shiba Inu, naming it among the key tokens to watch as he declared that ‚ÄúAltcoin Season‚Äù had begun. This reinforced his view that SHIB remains a strong contender despite market corrections. Current Price Trends and Analyst Projections Since Pippen voiced his optimism, both XRP and SHIB have experienced price declines. Over the past 30 days, XRP has fallen by 6.03%, currently trading at approximately $2.10. Shiba Inu, on the other hand, has seen a more substantial drop of 19.93%, with its price currently at $0.00001120. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite these setbacks, many analysts remain positive about the future trajectory of both assets. For Shiba Inu, market analysts such as Javon Marks and Eunice Wong believe the token could rise above $0.0001 during this bull cycle, setting a new all-time high. Regarding XRP, projections vary. Altcoin Moe predicts that the token could reach $5 by the end of 2025. However, other commentators consider this estimate conservative. Analyst Dustin Layton, for example, suggests that XRP has the potential to climb as high as $50, depending on market conditions and broader adoption trends. While the market remains uncertain in the short term, Scottie Pippen‚Äôs support for XRP and Shiba Inu reflects broader investor sentiment favoring altcoins with strong communities and long-term use cases. As the next bull market approaches, both retail investors and public figures continue to align their strategies with assets they believe are best positioned for growth.

The upturn follows a sharp rally last month, sparked by Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of a U.S. strategic crypto reserve , which included XRP, Solana, and Cardano. However, as clarifications emerged that the government would not actively acquire additional assets, the market retreated, pushing XRP down over 24.88%. Despite the pullback, analysts remain bullish on XRP‚Äôs long-term trajectory. On Saturday, popular crypto analyst Dark Defender highlighted a ‚ÄúCoffee Cup‚Äù pattern forming on XRP‚Äôs monthly price chart, describing it as a significant bullish signal. He noted that this pattern, combined with Elliott Wave analysis, suggests a dramatic price rally. ‚Äú The coffee cup pattern in markets is a U-shaped formation on a price chart. It indicates a potential bullish trend reversal after a downtrend, typically taking weeks to months to develop fully,‚Äù Dark Defender wrote. ‚ÄúBack at 50 cents, the cup‚Äôs surface tease and depth weren‚Äôt screaming yet, but they are now.‚Äù He further outlined three key price targets based on this setup: a surge to $5.85‚Äì$18.22 in Wave 3, a climb to $36 in Wave 5, and a long-term projection of $44.22 (a 1,965% surge) based on the cup‚Äôs depth. Adding to the bullish outlook, analyst Ali Martinez emphasized XRP‚Äôs critical technical positioning. He pointed out that if XRP avoids closing below the head-and-shoulders neckline and instead breaks above the right shoulder, it could invalidate the bearish setup, potentially triggering a breakout toward $5. Beyond technical analysis, experts anticipate trillions of dollars could flow into XRP, driven by evolving market dynamics and political shifts. Fintech and Web3 expert Jake Claver highlighted the significance of XRP holdings, noting that owning 10,000 XRP places an investor in the top 10% globally. He suggested institutional interest in XRP is growing behind the scenes. ‚ÄúThe big banks aren‚Äôt telling you this because they‚Äôre loading up their own bags,‚Äù Claver stated. ‚ÄúWhen XRP becomes the backbone of global finance, you‚Äôll wish you listened.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs recent announcement of the U.S. ‚ÄòCrypto Strategic Reserve‚Äô has further elevated XRP‚Äôs profile. Yassin Mobarak, a popular XRP community member, even speculated on the possibility of the U.S. accepting XRP for the $125 million fee judgment in Ripple‚Äôs securities lawsuit with the SEC, which could lead to unprecedented governmental alignment with XRP holders. ‚ÄúThat means for the first time in history, the U.S. government will own XRP and therefore will be incentivized to let its value grow over-time. That will mean the shackles that prevented XRP from being used in the U.S. will finally be removed and XRP will finally be allowed to assume the utility it was created for. That in turn will mean positive price movements for $XRP,‚Äù Mobarak wrote .

Despite this disruption, many Telegram-based marketplaces with similar operations remain unaffected and are actively growing. Vendors Shift to Tudou According to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic‚Äôs latest report , Huione Guarantee‚Äôs activity has come to a halt, but its exit has triggered a migration. Vendors are being steered toward Tudou Guarantee, which has absorbed a large share of Huione‚Äôs transactions. Before its abrupt shutdown, Huione Guarantee was operated by the Cambodia-based Huione Group. It was originally launched in 2021 with the intention of facilitating legitimate transactions involving assets like cars and real estate. Over time, however, the platform‚Äôs listings shifted focus. Leading up to its closure, much of Huione Guarantee‚Äôs activity seems geared toward supporting cyber scam operations, The authorities finally dismantled Huione Guarantee on May 13, 2025. This Telegram-based platform processed over $27 billion in transactions, mostly involving tools and services for large-scale online scams like pig butchering. Its downfall followed a detailed investigation by Elliptic, which led Telegram to delete thousands of related channels and ban associated user accounts. Still, Huione Guarantee represented just one node within a sprawling network of Chinese-language guarantee marketplaces. These platforms, thriving on Telegram, allow the exchange of illicit goods such as stolen data, fraudulent tech tools, and money laundering services, which are all vital to scam operations. Huione‚Äôs USDT Activity Nears Zero Transactions are conducted entirely in Tether‚Äôs USDT stablecoin, which ensures the ease of movement and pseudo-anonymity. In fact, Tether froze a Huione-linked wallet in July 2024 due to suspected ties to the North Korean hacking entity, Lazarus Group. After Telegram removed Huione‚Äôs public channels and usernames, the platform formally shut down, advising vendors to migrate to Tudou Guarantee. Initially, Huione claimed it would continue facilitating private escrow services, but by late May, it announced a full cessation of operations. Elliptic said that its blockchain data confirmed this exit, as incoming USDT flows to Huione‚Äôs wallets plummeted to ‚Äúnegligible levels.‚Äù The post Tudou Guarantee Emerges as Key Successor After Huione Darknet Shutdown appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Lazarus Group|Tether (USDT),EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-28 23:45:44

BCH recently crossed key resistance and now targets $710, with solid support at $450. Solana is holding near $145 after rebounding from global news dips. Experts now eye $160‚Äì$200 as ETF talks and high volumes boost momentum. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reshaping crypto rewards. BlockDAG is offering a battle for 100 million BDAG. Through four quests and live leaderboards, users complete tasks like testing smart contracts, social sharing, app installs, and referrals. The top contributors earn real BDAG, making BlockDAG a standout crypto opportunity today. Bitcoin Cash Price Outlook Aims at $700 After Breakout Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has bounced back strongly from $449, now eyeing the $612 to $710 range. The coin recently broke past a major resistance level near $454.74. Currently, $467 is acting as a key pivot; a push above could trigger a faster rally. On the downside, support between $419 and $378 remains firm, giving bulls a solid base. Trading volume has also climbed, driven by both retail and institutional buyers. Since March, BCH has nearly doubled, gaining new momentum in June as macro factors and stronger on-chain utility take hold. The CashTokens upgrade is helping grow real-world use cases for BCH, especially in low-fee payments. With the chart breakout confirmed and rising volatility, analysts are again focused on BCH‚Äôs run toward the $700 zone, a move that could happen if current trends hold. Solana (SOL) Price Surge Eyes $160 After Rebound Solana (SOL) has pushed back above $145 after bouncing from recent lows of $128, which were triggered by geopolitical news. Support is holding around $140‚Äì$143, with resistance near $145 to $146.55. If this range breaks, analysts expect a fast move to $160‚Äì$165. Growing talks around a potential Solana ETF and new institutional inflows are also boosting momentum. Bitget analysts remain bullish, suggesting a $300 long-term target if current volume trends continue. With strong buying signals in place, and $145 possibly turning into support, Solana could rally faster than many expect if the breakout unfolds in the coming weeks. BlockDAG Airdrop Rewards Real Effort With 100M BDAG BlockDAG‚Äôs airdrop isn‚Äôt a handout; it‚Äôs a game of skill. With 100 million BDAG on offer, users aren‚Äôt just collecting coins, they‚Äôre earning them. The competition runs across four quests: testnet, presale, social sharing, and referrals. Each action, from deploying a smart contract to inviting a friend, earns points and moves you up the leaderboard. Top players can earn as much as 10.1 million BDAG. And with the leaderboard resetting every 3 months, the challenge never stops. This smart structure draws real engagement, not bots or fake clicks. Tasks include using the X1 miner app, trying out smart contracts on the testnet, and building coins with the no-code token builder. The more you do, the more BDAG you can earn. The presale adds another layer. BlockDAG is now in Batch 29, priced at $0.0276. Early buyers from Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% return up to today‚Äôs price. Over $325 million has been raised so far, with 23.3 billion BDAG sold. The launch price is set at $0.05, offering room for gains from here. Also, a limited-time presale offers BDAG at just $0.0080. This gives both early movers and newcomers a window of opportunity. For those tracking standout crypto plays, BlockDAG delivers a unique mix of earning potential and long-term value, verified by audits from CertiK and Halborn, plus coming hardware rollouts. Summary Solana (SOL) is holding steady near $145, with targets set at $160 and beyond as ETF buzz and trading volumes build. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is aiming for $700 after breaking major resistance and gaining fresh momentum. Both are showing strong potential, but BlockDAG is drawing attention for a different reason. Its airdrop isn‚Äôt a simple freebie; it‚Äôs a skill-based challenge. With 100 million BDAG rewards up for grabs, BlockDAG ranks users on leaderboards through smart contract testing, app installs, social activity, and referrals.

A crypto analyst now points to recurring trends observed in past cycles, where Q3 has often acted as a launchpad for significant price rallies in BTC following each halving year. Bitcoin Post-Halving Years Point To Explosive Q3 Luca, a crypto market expert on X (formerly Twitter), has doubled down on expectations for a major Bitcoin price rally in the coming quarter. He argues that expectations of an extended consolidation in Bitcoin, based on the fractals and market behavior seen in 2023 and early 2024, fail to account for a critical factor: 2025 is a post-halving year. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble? Over $4 Million Liquidity Exit Sparks Crash Fears The analyst points to a consistent pattern observed in every post-halving year throughout Bitcoin‚Äôs history. In his chart analysis published on June 26, Luca notes that Q3 in these years have consistently demonstrated strength, with no historical precedent for weakness, reinforcing the case for a bullish breakout. The chart compares Q3 performance during the post-halving years of 2013, 2017, and 2021. In each case, Bitcoin entered the third quarter with moderate or corrective price action, only to rally significantly in the weeks that followed. The left panel of the chart shows the 2013 post-halving year, where Bitcoin went from under $100 in July to over $680 in November. In 2017, the middle panel highlighted a similar trajectory, where BTC broke out from under $2,800 in early Q3 to over $16,000 by year-end. The most recent cycle in 2021, shown in the right panel of the chart, saw a Q3 recovery rally that took Bitcoin from under $39,000 in July to a former all-time high above $69,000 in November. Notably, Luca maintains that this consistent historical behavior is not coincidental, predicting that a similar rally could unfold in the current cycle, within the next few months. While he acknowledges the possibility of a short-term pullback, he emphasizes that Bitcoin‚Äôs broader market structure remains firmly bullish, with momentum still favoring further upside.
