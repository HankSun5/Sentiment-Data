A swearing-in ceremony will soon put the former SEC commission in charge of the high-profile regulator — a matter cheered on by the digital assets sector that sees him as a strong ally after his significant background advising crypto firms as a financial-services consultant in Washington. Atkins' Senate confirmation was easily cleared on Wednesday in a 52-44 vote. The longtime figure in U.S. financial policy — both in government and as an outside adviser — was generally expected to easily move through confirmation, though the Senate Banking Committee approved Atkins along party lines , with all the panel's Democrats opposing the nominee. Atkins' confirmation took the usual months to emerge from the Senate, and in the time between the departure of predecessor Gary Gensler and Atkins' arrival, Trump's interim agency chief, Mark Uyeda, carried out an ambitious and rapidly deployed crypto overhaul. The SEC has thrown out almost all of its high-profile digital assets enforcement actions, and its staff quickly outlined a number of segments of the industry that it considers outside its jurisdiction — including some stablecoins, memecoins (such as the president's own $TRUMP) and proof-of-work mining. Many of the areas in which the agency has already demonstrated policy shifts overlap with Trump's family crypto businesses, including the family's memecoins and its ties to World Liberty Financial, which has pursued its own stablecoin. Atkins will be taking over those issues to apply permanent standards, potentially directed by future legislation that's now a priority in Congress. Atkins' tenure will begin with an incomplete commission, which is meant to have five members and whose sole Democrat — Caroline Crenshaw — is occupying an already expired term. The White House hasn't yet moved to fill the two Democratic positions on the commission.",Policy|Top Stories|Breaking News|Paul Atkins|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Senate,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 23:50:11
43144401,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147928,1744242627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking $1B US Fine Looms for TSMC in Huawei AI Chip Export Control Storm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-fine-tsmc-huawei-ai-chip/,"The tech world is buzzing with news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a giant in chip manufacturing, could be facing a monumental US fine . Reports suggest this penalty could reach a staggering $1 billion or more. The reason? A US export control investigation linked to a chip allegedly made by TSMC and used in a Huawei AI processor. This development, initially reported by Reuters, has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and technology sectors, raising questions about international trade and technological sovereignty. Why is the US considering a fine against TSMC? The core of the issue revolves around potential violations of US export control regulations. Let’s break down what we know: The Allegations : The investigation centers on a chip manufactured by TSMC that reportedly found its way into Huawei’s advanced Ascend 910B AI processor. The Players : Key entities involved are TSMC, Huawei, and Xiamen Sophgo Technologies (Sophgo), a Chinese chip designer affiliated with Bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain. The Timeline : This situation first surfaced in late 2024, with investigations unfolding into 2025. According to reports, the chip in question was designed by Sophgo and manufactured by TSMC. It’s then alleged that this Sophgo chip was incorporated into Huawei’s Ascend 910B AI chip . This multi-layered arrangement is crucial because Huawei’s processor is considered a cutting-edge piece of technology, especially for being produced in China. The estimated production runs into hundreds of thousands of units, amplifying the potential scale of the export control breach. TSMC, in response to these allegations, stated, “TSMC is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” They further emphasized their proactive communication with the U.S. Commerce Department and commitment to compliance. Timeline of Events: Unpacking the TSMC-Huawei-Sophgo Situation To better understand the gravity of this potential US fine , let’s look at a timeline of key events: Date Event Significance October 2024 TechInsights, a Canadian research firm, disassembles Huawei’s 910B AI processor. Discovery of a TSMC-based chipset inside, resembling a Sophgo design, triggering initial concerns. November 2024 U.S. Department of Commerce orders TSMC to halt advanced chip shipments to Chinese customers, including Sophgo. Escalation of US scrutiny and direct impact on TSMC’s business with Chinese firms. December 2024 U.S. Commerce Department considers adding Sophgo to the U.S. blacklist. Increased pressure on Sophgo and further tightening of export controls. January 2025 U.S. adds over twenty Chinese companies, including Sophgo and Zhipu AI, to the blacklist. Formal blacklisting of Sophgo, restricting its access to US technology and markets. What’s at Stake for TSMC and the Chip Industry? The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is not just about the money. It carries significant implications: Financial Impact : A billion-dollar fine is substantial, even for a company as large as TSMC. It could impact their profitability and future investments. Reputational Damage : Allegations of export control violations can tarnish TSMC’s reputation as a trusted global chip manufacturer. Geopolitical Ramifications : This incident underscores the escalating tensions in the global technology race, particularly between the US and China. It highlights the complexities of supply chains and international regulations in the semiconductor industry. Industry-Wide Alert : This case serves as a stark reminder for all chip manufacturers about the stringent enforcement of export controls and the need for meticulous compliance. Huawei ‘s Role and the Tech Cold War Huawei , at the center of this controversy, has been a focal point of US-China tech tensions for years. The US government has repeatedly expressed concerns about Huawei’s technology and its potential national security implications. The alleged use of TSMC-manufactured chips in Huawei’s AI processor further intensifies this ongoing tech cold war. For Huawei , securing advanced AI chips is crucial for maintaining its competitiveness in the global market. Despite US sanctions, Huawei has shown resilience and continues to innovate. This situation underscores the immense pressure on Chinese tech companies to achieve self-sufficiency in critical technologies like semiconductors. Export Control Compliance: A New Era for Tech Companies? This unfolding situation with TSMC emphasizes the critical importance of export control compliance for tech companies operating globally. The regulations are complex and constantly evolving, requiring companies to be vigilant and proactive in their compliance efforts. Key takeaways for tech companies: Robust Compliance Programs : Companies need to invest in comprehensive export control compliance programs. Due Diligence : Thorough due diligence is essential to ensure adherence to all applicable regulations. Transparency and Communication : Open communication with regulatory authorities is crucial when potential issues arise. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for TSMC, Huawei, and US-China Tech Relations? The outcome of the US fine investigation into TSMC will be closely watched by the global tech industry. It will not only impact TSMC and Huawei but also set precedents for how export controls are enforced in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and semiconductor technology. As the investigation progresses, the industry braces for potential shifts in supply chains, compliance strategies, and the delicate balance of US-China tech relations. The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is a stark reminder of the high stakes in the global tech arena. It highlights the intricate web of international regulations, technological innovation, and geopolitical tensions that define the modern semiconductor industry. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech investors alike, this saga underscores the interconnectedness of global technology policy and market dynamics.

As of 8th of April 2025 , Solana trades at $107 , XRP at $1.75 , Ethereum at $1,520 , and MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.0002772 in its presale. While the first three leverage established ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5.5 million presale raise and $5 target—a 71,329% ROI—could outshine them all by 2025 . Solana: A 500% Gain to $642? Solana, at $107 after a 10% dip in 7 days , is a favorite for its 4,000 transactions per second and $5 billion DeFi TVL across 1,000+ projects. Its 8,000% growth since 2021 shows promise. Coinpedia forecasts $1,000 by 2025 , an 834% gain, turning $100 into $934 . A 500% gain requires $642 , achievable by late 2025 , per X posts, if Solana’s NFT and gaming sectors grow. However, its $50 billion market cap (adjusted for $107 price) and competition from layer-1s like Aptos ( $2 billion TVL) may cap its upside in a bearish market. XRP: Targeting $10.50 for 500%? XRP, down 15% to $1.75 as of 7th of April 2025 , benefits from its SEC settlement on 25th of March 2025 , reducing a $125 million fine to $50 million . Its 1,500 transactions per second at 0.00001 XRP per transaction and 300+ financial partnerships drive adoption. Bitnation predicts $12 by 2026 , but some X posts see $10 by 2025 , a 471% gain, making $100 worth $571 . A 500% gain needs $10.50 , possible by 2025 if ETF approvals materialize, though its $118 billion market cap and RLUSD competition ( $170 million cap) pose challenges. Ethereum: 500% to $9,120 in Reach? Ethereum, at $1,520 after a 15% drop in 7 days , boasts a 619,116% historical ROI and $182 billion market cap (adjusted for $1,520 price). Its layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( $1.5 billion TVL) and 1,000+ dApps fuel growth. Analysts on X predict $10,000 by 2025 , a 558% gain, turning $100 into $658 . A 500% gain requires $9,120 , possible by 2025 , per Changelly, if tokenization and staking ( $100 billion locked) accelerate. Ethereum’s gas fees ( $2.50 average) and competition from Solana may slow its path to 500% in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Rising Star Analysts Predict Could Deliver 18,500% Returns 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $5.5 million , with Phase 7 at 80% sold out as of 5th of April 2025 . Priced at $0.0002772 , its listing price of $0.007 offers a 2,500% ROI—already surpassing 500% . Analysts forecast $5 by 2025 , a 71,329% gain from listing. A $100 investment buys 360,750 tokens, worth $2,500 at listing and $1.8 million at $5 . A 500% gain is hit at just $0.00166 , a fraction of its target. With a 100% Hashex audit, DeFi lending at 20%+ yields, and 50,000 supporters growing by 12,000 weekly across 30+ countries, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 1,570.6% presale rise from Stage 1 sets it apart. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshines the Pack Solana ( $642 ), XRP ( $10.50 ), and Ethereum ( $9,120 ) need 500% gains that their large market caps ( $50 billion , $118 billion , $182 billion ) make tough in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 target and 71,329% potential—already 2,500% at listing—leverage a smaller cap. Its $5.5 million raise, against XRP’s $1.5 million weekly inflow, shows stronger retail faith. A $100 investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE hits $10K at $0.027 , a 100x , making 500% a mere milestone.

Last month, the DeFi project announced plans to launch a new stablecoin called USD1, which it says is pegged to the US dollar and backed by short-term government treasuries, dollar deposits and cash equivalents. Now, World Liberty wants to test its on-chain airdrop feature by distributing a small amount of USD1 to all current WLFI token holders. In a new proposal , the project says the final exact amount will be based “on total eligible wallets and budget.” Explains World Liberty, “Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1.” World Liberty notes in the fine print on its website that President Donald Trump is not an officer, director, founder, or employee of the firm or any of its affiliates, but the company does name the president as the “Chief Crypto Advocate.” World Liberty’s website also states that DT Marks DEFI LLC, an entity affiliated with Trump and some of his family members, holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens and is entitled to receive fees from the project.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy Flashes Warning,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sale-to-cover-debt-michael-saylors-strategy-flashes-warning/,"Strategy, the software company led by Michael Saylor, might need to sell some of its massive Bitcoin holdings to pay its bills. The company revealed this possibility in a regulatory filing on April 7, saying that without new financing, it could be forced to sell Bitcoin to cover financial obligations. Company Faces Billions In Potential Q1 Losses According to the filing, Strategy expects to report an unrealized loss of nearly $6 billion for the first quarter of 2025. This comes despite having a $1.7 billion tax benefit. The company currently holds over 528,000 B TC purchased at about $67,450 per coin, as Saylor posted on X on March 31. Their total investment amounts to more than $35 billion. Debt And Dividend Pressure Mounts The pressure on Strategy’s finances is growing. The company has roughly $8 billion in debt and must pay about $35 million in yearly interest payments. On top of that, it needs to distribute $150 million in annual dividends. $MSTR has acquired 22,048 BTC for ~$1.92 billion at ~$86,969 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 11.0% YTD 2025. As of 3/30/2025, @Strategy holds 528,185 $BTC acquired for ~$35.63 billion at ~$67,458 per bitcoin. $STRK $STRF https://t.co/1sfyBIglnt — Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 31, 2025 Reports suggest the company’s software business doesn’t make enough money to cover these costs. If Bitcoin prices drop, the company’s ability to manage its debt could be in trouble. New Funding Plan Announced To fix its cash problems , Strategy announced on March 10 plans to raise $2.1 billion by selling perpetual preferred stock with an 8% dividend. This move would help the company get money without taking on more traditional debt. The rumor has it that Strategy filed an 8-K form with the SEC on April 7, stating that if the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, the company may be forced to sell its Bitcoin holdings to repay debts. It was found that this statement is a standard risk disclosure practice, and it… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 9, 2025 The funds would support both company operations and, surprisingly, the purchase of even more Bitcoin. Based on reports from Wu Blockchain, warnings like these have appeared in past filings, suggesting this might be standard disclosure language rather than a new emergency. Bitcoin Price Trends And Expert Predictions Bitcoin trades at about $76,100 right now, which is down 8% over the past week. While this price is still above Strategy’s average purchase cost, market volatility puts the company in a risky position. Not everyone sees doom ahead, though. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an April 8 interview that Bitcoin could reach $110,000 or higher in the coming months. He believes central banks will soon cut interest rates, increasing global cash flow and helping Bitcoin’s price rise as a deflationary asset. The situation highlights how closely Strategy’s fate is now tied to BTC’s performance. While the company tries to secure more funding, its future depends largely on whether the cryptocurrency market moves up or down in the months ahead.

The ETF, trading under the ticker XXRP, achieved this milestone as cryptocurrency markets faced widespread selling pressure. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the performance “very respectable” given the current bearish market conditions. Related Reading: XRP Will Explode—And This Korean Expert Says He’ll Be ‘Laughing’ At Critics XRP Price Hits Five-Month Low As New ETF Launches According to market data, XRP’s price dropped to $1.61 on Monday, marking its lowest point in five months. The price briefly recovered to over $1.87 on Tuesday before falling again to $1.69 by evening. Even with these unstable price movements, Teucrium moved forward with its ETF launch, aiming to give investors a way to profit from price swings in either direction. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 New XRP ETF Outperforms Similar Solana Product Based on reports from Bloomberg’s Balchunas, the XXRP ETF’s first-day trading volume was about four times higher than what Solana’s similar 2x ETF saw on its launch day. This performance puts Teucrium’s product in the top 5% of all new ETF launches. However, the $5.43 million figure still pales in comparison to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF debut, which saw trading volume roughly 200 times larger. Community Shows Interest Despite Broad Market Losses The altcoin community has responded positively to the ETF launch, especially considering the harsh market conditions. Data shows that 137,000 traders faced liquidations in the 24 hours surrounding the launch, with total losses exceeding $413 million across cryptocurrency markets. Some XRP supporters have suggested that while XXRP’s volume was much smaller than BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a potential spot ETF (which some have dubbed “IXRP”) could provide stronger competition. How The 2x XRP ETF Works And Its Risks Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold the underlying asset, Teucrium’s XXRP does not invest directly in XRP tokens. Instead, it’s designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP’s price movements, which amplifies both gains and losses for investors. Related Reading: XRP Dump? Not So Fast—Software Engineer Says Panic Selling Makes No Sense Community figure Crypto Eri warned about the ETF’s built-in risk factors, noting that even if XRP’s price stays flat, volatility alone could cause significant losses. For example, if XRP experiences 25% volatility, XXRP holders could see a 6% loss. With 70% volatility, those losses could balloon to 40%. The launch comes as more than 10 asset managers have filed applications with the SEC for spot XRP ETFs. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications, though BlackRock has not yet expressed interest in launching an XRP-specific ETF product.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently addressed the Ways & Means Committee, making a statement that has reverberated across economic and political circles. According to reports from Walter Bloomberg X account, Greer indicated that President Donald Trump’s authority to impose tariffs is not without boundaries. This revelation sparks crucial questions about the future of US trade policy and the balance of power within the U.S. government. Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal announcement and explore its potential ramifications. What Did the Trade Representative Reveal About Trump’s Tariff Authority? Jamieson Greer’s appearance before the Ways & Means Committee was closely watched, especially given the Trump administration’s assertive approach to trade and tariffs. His statement, as reported, directly addresses the extent of presidential power in this domain. Here’s a breakdown of what we understand: Not Unlimited Power: The core message is clear – the President’s authority to apply tariffs is not absolute. This suggests there are checks and balances in place, even in matters of trade, which are often considered under executive purview. Congressional Oversight: Greer’s testimony before the Ways & Means Committee itself highlights the role of Congress in overseeing trade policy. The committee’s questioning and Greer’s responses underscore the legislative branch’s interest and influence in this area. Legal and Constitutional Framework: The notion of limited authority implies that tariff decisions are likely subject to a legal and constitutional framework. This could mean that certain tariff actions could be challenged or reviewed, ensuring they align with existing laws and trade agreements. This isn’t just about semantics; it’s about the very foundation of how US trade policy is formulated and implemented. It sets the stage for a potentially more nuanced and collaborative approach to international trade relations. Why is the Scope of Presidential Tariff Authority Under Scrutiny? The question of presidential tariff authority isn’t new, but it has gained prominence in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration. Several factors contribute to this increased scrutiny: Trump Administration’s Trade Actions: President Trump frequently utilized tariffs as a tool in trade negotiations and to address perceived trade imbalances. High-profile tariff disputes with countries like China and the European Union brought the issue of tariff authority to the forefront. Economic Impact of Tariffs: Tariffs can have significant economic consequences, affecting industries, consumers, and international relations. Concerns about these impacts naturally lead to questions about the process and authority behind tariff decisions. Separation of Powers: In the U.S. system of government, the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is fundamental. Debates about tariff authority often touch upon the balance of power between the President and Congress in matters of trade. Global Trade Norms: International trade is governed by a complex web of agreements and norms. Unilateral tariff actions can sometimes clash with these norms, raising questions about the consistency and predictability of US trade policy on the global stage. Therefore, Greer’s statement can be seen as part of a broader discussion about the appropriate limits of executive power in trade, especially in a globalized economy where trade policies have far-reaching effects. The Role of the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill Understanding the context of Jamieson Greer’s statement requires looking at the roles of both the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill . The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR): Key Trade Negotiator: The USTR is the primary entity responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and commodity policy. They lead negotiations with foreign governments and represent the U.S. at international trade organizations. Advisor to the President: The Trade Representative serves as the principal trade advisor to the President. Their views and statements carry significant weight in shaping the administration’s trade agenda. Congressional Interaction: While part of the executive branch, the USTR regularly interacts with Congress, particularly committees like the Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade matters. This interaction is crucial for policy alignment and oversight. Capitol Hill and the Ways & Means Committee: Legislative Oversight: Capitol Hill , as the seat of Congress, plays a vital role in legislative oversight of executive actions, including trade policy. Committees like the Ways & Means Committee are specifically tasked with reviewing and shaping trade-related legislation. Public Forum for Debate: Congressional hearings, such as the one where Greer testified, provide a public forum for discussing and debating important policy issues. They allow for transparency and accountability in government actions. Influence on Trade Laws: Congress has the power to enact laws that can shape and constrain presidential authority, including in the area of tariffs. The Ways & Means Committee’s engagement signals a potential legislative interest in clarifying or reinforcing the limits of Trump tariff authority or any presidential tariff authority in the future. The dialogue between the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill is thus a critical part of the checks and balances system, ensuring that trade policy is not solely determined by the executive branch. Implications for Future US Trade and Global Relations Greer’s statement about the limits of Trump tariff authority has several potential implications: More Predictable Trade Policy: If presidential tariff authority is perceived as constrained, it could lead to a more predictable and stable trade policy environment. This predictability is beneficial for businesses, investors, and international partners. Increased Congressional Role: Acknowledging limits on presidential authority could empower Congress to play a more active role in shaping trade policy. This might lead to more bipartisan and consensus-based approaches to trade. Potential for Reduced Trade Tensions: If the U.S. signals a move away from unilateral tariff actions, it could help reduce trade tensions with other countries. This could foster a more cooperative global trade environment. Legal Challenges to Tariffs: The recognition of limits might also open the door for legal challenges to tariffs that are seen as exceeding presidential authority. This could create a more judicial dimension to trade policy oversight. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges: Executive Branch Pushback: Future administrations might push back against perceived limitations on their tariff authority, potentially leading to further political and legal battles. Navigating Geopolitical Tensions: Trade is often intertwined with geopolitical considerations. Limits on tariff authority could constrain the U.S.’s ability to respond assertively to unfair trade practices or geopolitical challenges. Domestic Political Pressures: Domestic industries and political groups may lobby for tariff protections, and a perceived weakening of presidential tariff power could create domestic political tensions. Actionable Insights and Looking Ahead For businesses and stakeholders involved in international trade, Greer’s statement offers several key takeaways and actionable insights: Monitor Policy Developments: Closely track further statements and actions from both the USTR and Capitol Hill regarding trade policy and tariff authority. Policy shifts can significantly impact business strategies. Assess Risk and Opportunity: Evaluate how potential changes in US trade policy might affect your supply chains, markets, and competitive landscape. Identify both risks and opportunities arising from a potentially more constrained approach to tariffs. Engage in Policy Dialogue: Participate in industry associations and engage with policymakers to voice your perspectives on trade policy. Your input can help shape future trade regulations and agreements. Prepare for Legal and Regulatory Scrutiny: Be prepared for potential legal challenges to tariff actions and increased regulatory scrutiny of trade practices. Ensure compliance and seek legal counsel when needed. The unfolding narrative around Trump tariff authority and its limitations is a crucial development in the landscape of international trade. It signals a potential shift towards a more balanced and perhaps less unilateral approach to trade policy. For those operating in the global economic sphere, understanding these nuances is not just academic—it’s essential for strategic planning and navigating the complexities of the modern trade environment. Conclusion: A New Chapter in US Trade Policy? Jamieson Greer’s statement on Capitol Hill , highlighting the limits of presidential Trump tariff authority , marks a potentially pivotal moment for US trade policy . It underscores the enduring principles of checks and balances within the U.S. government and signals a possible recalibration of trade policy away from unilateral actions towards a more collaborative and predictable framework. While the full implications will unfold over time, this development warrants close attention from anyone invested in international trade, global economics, and the evolving dynamics of power in Washington D.C. The future trajectory of US trade policy may well be shaped by this crucial acknowledgement of limitations.

BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price sunk to its lowest level in five months, dropping over 10% from last week. BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. ETH is down ~56% year to date and is ~69% below its record high from November 2021. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. XRP's is down ~23% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

43145018,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147930,1744243813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Shift: Tariff Wars Ignite Crypto Payment Adoption, VanEck Reveals",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tariff-wars-crypto-payment-adoption/,"Are you prepared for a seismic shift in global finance? The escalating trade tensions led by the U.S. are not just reshaping international commerce; they’re inadvertently fueling a surge in crypto payment adoption . VanEck, a well-regarded investment management firm, has released a compelling report highlighting this unexpected consequence of tariff wars. Let’s dive into how these global economic pressures are pushing nations and businesses towards cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Why Tariff Tensions Are a Catalyst for Crypto Payment Adoption? The core of the issue lies in the disruption of traditional financial systems. When countries impose tariffs and engage in trade disputes, the stability of fiat currencies can be called into question. VanEck’s report suggests that this instability, coupled with a desire to circumvent traditional financial rails, is making crypto payment adoption increasingly attractive. Think of it as a financial detour around roadblocks erected by trade wars. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Dollar Weakness: Continued uncertainty and trade imbalances can lead to a weakening U.S. dollar, the world’s reserve currency. This makes alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, more appealing as stores of value and mediums of exchange. Geopolitical Fragmentation: As global alliances shift and trade blocs realign, countries are seeking financial independence. Cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized, borderless solution that sidesteps traditional geopolitical constraints. Sanctions and Restrictions: Tariff wars often go hand-in-hand with sanctions. Cryptocurrencies can provide a route for nations and entities to conduct transactions outside the reach of these restrictions. Desire for Alternatives: Businesses and individuals caught in the crossfire of trade disputes may actively seek alternative payment systems to mitigate risks and ensure smooth transactions. Bitcoin : The Unexpected Beneficiary? While the cryptocurrency landscape is vast, Bitcoin is emerging as a primary beneficiary of this trend. Its established network, decentralized nature, and increasing acceptance as a store of value position it uniquely in this evolving scenario. VanEck’s report highlights specific instances where Bitcoin is gaining traction due to tariff-related pressures. Examples from the Report: China and Russia Energy Deals: Watcher Guru’s report on X indicates that China and Russia are reportedly utilizing cryptocurrencies for some energy transactions. This could be a strategic move to bypass dollar-denominated systems and mitigate the impact of potential tariffs or sanctions on energy trade. Emerging BTC Mining Hubs: Countries like Bolivia, France, and Germany are reportedly exploring Bitcoin mining and energy strategies. This suggests a proactive approach to leveraging Bitcoin, potentially as a means to attract investment, diversify energy resources, and position themselves in the burgeoning crypto economy. What Are the Potential Benefits of Crypto Payments in a Tariff-Driven World? The rise of crypto payment adoption , spurred by tariff tensions, presents several potential advantages: Reduced Transaction Costs: Cross-border transactions using traditional banking systems can be expensive and time-consuming. Cryptocurrencies can offer significantly lower fees and faster settlement times. Increased Efficiency: Crypto transactions are often processed more quickly than traditional bank transfers, streamlining international trade and payments. Greater Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide access to financial services for individuals and businesses in regions with limited banking infrastructure, fostering greater global economic participation. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies, offers enhanced security and transparency in transactions, reducing the risk of fraud and corruption. Are There Challenges to Overcome for Widespread Crypto Payment Adoption? Despite the promising outlook, widespread crypto payment adoption in international trade faces certain hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Lack of clear and consistent regulations can hinder widespread adoption by businesses and institutions. Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrency prices can be volatile, which can be a concern for businesses engaged in international trade. However, stablecoins and other mechanisms are emerging to mitigate this volatility. Scalability Issues: Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin in its early days, have faced scalability challenges in processing a large volume of transactions. However, technological advancements are addressing these issues. Education and Awareness: Widespread adoption requires greater education and awareness about cryptocurrencies and their benefits among businesses and consumers. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Financial Landscape For businesses and individuals looking to navigate this evolving financial landscape, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in both global trade and the cryptocurrency space. Follow reports from institutions like VanEck and stay updated on regulatory changes. Explore Crypto Payment Solutions: Businesses involved in international trade should explore integrating cryptocurrency payment solutions to potentially reduce costs, increase efficiency, and mitigate risks associated with traditional financial systems. Consider Bitcoin as a Hedge: In an environment of dollar weakness and geopolitical uncertainty, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Educate Yourself: Invest time in understanding the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This knowledge will be crucial for making informed decisions in the future. Conclusion: Embracing the Inevitable Shift? VanEck’s report paints a compelling picture of how tariff tensions are acting as an unexpected catalyst for crypto payment adoption . While challenges remain, the potential benefits – from reduced transaction costs to greater financial independence – are undeniable. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as alternative settlement tools and hedges against uncertainty is likely to become increasingly significant.

This development is significant as Atkins has promised to provide regulatory clarity for the industry, which was lacking under past Chair Gary Gensler’s administration. US Senate Confirms Paul Atkins As SEC Chair In an X post , Journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that the US Senate has confirmed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. The Upper Chamber voted 52 to 44 in favor of Atkins’ nomination for the SEC role. Pro-Bitcoin and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis also confirmed this development, sharing her excitement about Atkin’s confirmation as the SEC Chair. The Senator revealed her discussion with him about digital asset legislation and affirmed that she is confident that his leadership will bring positive change. As CoinGape reported, Paul Atkins had promised during his nomination hearing to prioritize providing regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. The incoming SEC Chair also promised to repair the Commission’s image following Gensler’s infamous regulation-by-enforcement approach. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of the top crypto exchange , Coinbase, also congratulated Atkins on his confirmation. He stated that more progress is “sorely needed” after four years of regress. One Final Step Before The Swearing In Terrett revealed that the US Senate will send Paul Atkins’ confirmation to the White House, where US President Donald Trump will sign off on it. Once that happens, the president will swear him in as the next US SEC Chair. However, it remains unclear when exactly this will happen. In the meantime, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda would continue at the helm of affairs. The Commission has planned a roundtable for April 11, which would focus on crypto trading. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce remarked that hearing the public’s concerns and suggestions helps the Commission “create a clear, sensible, and fair path forward for the crypto industry.” The post US Senate Confirms Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins As SEC Chair appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News|paul atkins|US SEC|US SEC Chair,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-10 00:12:53

The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF would seek to track the price of the memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), according to the firm’s April 9 Form S-1 registration statement. The Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, plans to assist 21Shares with marketing the fund. 21Shares said Coinbase Custody would be the proposed custodian of its Dogecoin ETF but did not specify a fee, ticker or what stock exchange it would list on. Source: James Seyffart 21Shares must also file a 19b-4 filing with the SEC to kickstart the regulator's approval process for the fund. DOGE currently has a $24.2 billion market cap and is the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by value. It was created in 2013 as a joke and is a fork of Lucky Coin, which itself is a fork of Bitcoin. 21Shares’ proposed Dogecoin ETF is the company’s latest effort to expand its spot crypto ETF offerings, which currently includes only a spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) fund. The issuer also filed with the SEC in February to launch a spot Polkadot ( DOT ) ETF and last year, it filed to create a spot XRP ( XRP ) ETF. Related: Dogecoin millionaires are buying dips as DOGE price eyes 30% rally The recent surge in crypto ETF filings reflects a “spaghetti cannon approach” from issuers testing which products the new SEC leadership might approve, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in February. “Issuers will try to launch many many different things and see what sticks,” Seyffart said. Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in February that there is a 75% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Dogecoin ETF this year, while the betting platform Polymarket currently gives approval odds of 64%. 21Shares and House of Doge partner for DOGE funds in Switzerland 21Shares also said on April 9 that it partnered with House of Doge to launch a fully backed Dogecoin exchange-traded product on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange. The 21Shares Dogecoin product will trade under the ticker “DOGE” with a 2.5% fee. 21Shares president Duncan Moir said that Dogecoin “has become more than a cryptocurrency: it represents a cultural and financial movement that continues to drive mainstream adoption, and DOGE offers investors a regulated avenue to be part of this exciting project.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-10 00:16:44

A top White House official is boldly proclaiming that a golden age for digital assets could be unleashed under a Trump administration. Bo Hines, chairman of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, has ignited excitement in the crypto community with his recent statements. Could this be the dawn of a new era for crypto in the United States? Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of digital currencies. Is Trump the Crypto President Ushering in a Golden Age? Bo Hines didn’t mince words when he took to X (formerly Twitter) to declare President Donald Trump as the true crypto president . This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a signal of a potentially dramatic change in approach towards digital assets in the US. Hines argues that under Trump’s leadership, the United States is poised to enter a ‘golden age’ for crypto and other groundbreaking financial technologies. This statement is a stark contrast to the current regulatory environment and hints at a future where innovation in the digital asset space might be not just tolerated, but actively encouraged. Here’s a breakdown of Hines’ key points: Trump as the ‘Crypto President’: Hines positions Trump as a champion for the crypto industry, suggesting a deep understanding and support for its growth. Golden Age Promise: The claim of a ‘golden age’ implies a period of significant growth, innovation, and perhaps less restrictive regulation for the crypto sector. Critique of Biden Administration: Hines alleges that crypto companies have been unfairly targeted by a ‘weaponized judicial system’ under the current administration, suggesting a hostile regulatory environment. What Does a Crypto Golden Age Actually Mean for Digital Assets? The term ‘ golden age ‘ is certainly attention-grabbing, but what could it realistically entail for the world of digital assets ? For crypto enthusiasts and businesses, this phrase conjures up images of reduced regulatory burdens, clearer legal frameworks, and a government that fosters rather than hinders innovation. Let’s consider some potential benefits: Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: A golden age could mean a move away from what many in the industry perceive as regulation by enforcement. Clearer rules and guidelines could attract more investment and encourage growth. Innovation Hub: With a more supportive stance, the US could become a global hub for crypto innovation, attracting talent and businesses from around the world. Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector can create jobs, spur technological advancements, and contribute significantly to the economy. Mainstream Adoption: Less hostile policies could pave the way for wider mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology across various sectors. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that a ‘golden age’ isn’t just about deregulation. It also necessitates responsible growth, consumer protection, and addressing legitimate concerns around illicit activities. The challenge lies in finding the right balance. Navigating Crypto Regulation: A Trump vs. Biden Comparison The current narrative from Hines paints a picture of stark contrast between potential crypto regulation under Trump and the existing policies under Biden. While the Biden administration has focused on investor protection and combating illicit finance in the crypto space, leading to increased scrutiny and enforcement actions, the Trump camp seems to be signaling a more industry-friendly approach. Here’s a simplified comparison: Aspect Biden Administration (Perceived) Potential Trump Administration (Projected) Regulatory Focus Investor protection, combating illicit finance, increased scrutiny Innovation, economic growth, potentially lighter regulatory touch Industry Perception Seen as restrictive and sometimes hostile Potentially more supportive and encouraging Enforcement Actions Increased, with focus on compliance and alleged violations Potentially reduced, with focus on fostering growth Overall Tone Cautious, emphasizing risks Optimistic, emphasizing opportunities It’s important to note that these are perceptions and projections based on current statements and trends. Actual policies and outcomes can be complex and influenced by various factors. The Future of US Crypto Policy: What to Expect? Looking ahead, the direction of US crypto policy remains a critical question for the global digital asset market. Hines’ statements suggest a significant potential shift if Trump were to regain the presidency. This could have far-reaching implications not only for the US crypto industry but also for the global landscape, influencing how other countries approach digital asset regulation. Key questions to consider: Will Regulation Ease? Could we see a rollback of some current regulations or a shift towards a more permissive regulatory framework? Innovation Boom? Would a Trump administration actively promote crypto innovation through policy and incentives? Global Impact? How would a US ‘golden age’ for crypto affect international crypto markets and regulatory trends? Balancing Innovation and Protection? Can a Trump administration strike the right balance between fostering growth and ensuring consumer protection and financial stability? The answers to these questions will unfold over time, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto policy in the US is heating up, and the potential for significant change is palpable. The prospect of a ‘golden age’ under a Trump presidency is a powerful narrative that has undoubtedly captured the attention of the crypto world. Conclusion: A New Dawn or Just a Promise? Bo Hines’ bold pronouncements have injected a surge of optimism into the crypto community. The idea of a ‘golden age’ for digital assets under a Trump administration is certainly compelling for those who feel stifled by current regulations. Whether this vision becomes reality remains to be seen. However, it’s undeniable that the political winds are shifting, and the future of crypto in the United States could be on the cusp of a significant transformation. Keep a close watch on developments in US crypto policy – the next chapter could be truly groundbreaking.

A new report from CryptoQuant, shared via X, paints a compelling picture of Binance’s growing dominance in the spot trading arena, leaving competitors in its wake. Let’s dive into the numbers and analyze what this powerful trend means for the crypto landscape. Binance Spot Trading Volume: A Deep Dive into Dominance The numbers don’t lie. According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, the overall spot trading volume for Bitcoin and altcoins has seen a significant decrease since February 3rd. Spot Bitcoin trading volume plummeted from a robust $44 billion to a more modest $10 billion. Similarly, altcoin spot trading volume experienced a sharp decline, shrinking from $122 billion to $23 billion. This market-wide contraction makes Binance’s performance even more noteworthy. Here’s where Binance’s crypto exchange dominance truly shines: Bitcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s share of the Bitcoin spot trading volume reached an impressive 49% during this period of market decline. Nearly half of all spot Bitcoin trades are happening on Binance. Altcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s grip on altcoin trading is even stronger. The exchange commands a staggering 64% of the total altcoin spot trading volume. That’s almost two-thirds of the entire market! Competitor Contraction: While Binance’s share has surged, the volume accounted for by its competitors has noticeably decreased. This indicates a clear shift in market share towards Binance. Why is Binance Solidifying its Spot Trading Lead? What factors are contributing to Binance’s growing market share in spot trading? Several elements likely play a crucial role: Liquidity: Binance is renowned for its deep liquidity. Traders flock to exchanges where they can execute large orders quickly and efficiently without significantly impacting prices. High liquidity attracts more volume, creating a positive feedback loop. Variety of Trading Pairs: Binance offers an extensive selection of trading pairs, including a vast array of altcoins. This caters to a wide range of traders with diverse investment strategies. User Experience: Binance’s platform is generally considered user-friendly, with a robust trading interface, comprehensive charting tools, and mobile accessibility. A seamless user experience can be a significant draw for both novice and experienced traders. Global Reach: Binance operates globally, serving users in numerous countries. This broad reach expands its potential user base and trading volume. Reputation and Trust: Despite facing regulatory challenges in some jurisdictions, Binance has built a strong brand reputation and a degree of trust within the crypto community, particularly for its trading capabilities. Bitcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Near Half-Share The fact that Binance captures nearly half of the Bitcoin trading volume is a testament to its strength in the flagship cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin remains the most traded cryptocurrency, and Binance’s dominance here underscores its position as a primary venue for Bitcoin transactions. This substantial Bitcoin volume contributes significantly to Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Altcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Commanding Two-Thirds Binance’s control over altcoin trading volume is even more pronounced, reaching almost two-thirds of the market. Altcoins, with their higher volatility and diverse narratives, often attract speculative trading interest. Binance’s extensive altcoin listings and deep liquidity in these pairs make it the go-to platform for altcoin traders. This dominance in the altcoin space further solidifies Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Is Binance’s Dominance a Threat or a Benefit to the Crypto Market? The question arises: is Binance’s increasing crypto exchange dominance a positive or negative development for the broader cryptocurrency market? Potential Benefits: Increased Liquidity: Binance’s dominance can concentrate liquidity, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient trading conditions for users on its platform. Platform Stability and Innovation: As a leading exchange, Binance has the resources to invest in platform stability, security, and innovation, potentially benefiting the entire ecosystem. Potential Challenges: Centralization Risks: Concentrated market share in one exchange raises concerns about centralization. If Binance were to face significant issues (regulatory, technical, or security-related), it could have a disproportionate impact on the market. Reduced Competition: Excessive dominance could stifle competition among exchanges, potentially leading to fewer choices and less innovation in the long run. Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance’s size and influence attract increased regulatory attention, which could lead to compliance burdens and operational challenges. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders For crypto traders, Binance’s spot trading dominance has several implications: Liquidity Access: Binance remains a prime destination for accessing deep liquidity, especially for Bitcoin and a wide range of altcoins. Price Discovery: Prices on Binance can be highly influential in the broader market due to its significant trading volume. Traders should monitor Binance’s price action closely. Diversification Considerations: While Binance offers advantages, traders should also consider diversifying their exchange usage to mitigate risks associated with relying heavily on a single platform. Conclusion: Binance’s Reign in Spot Trading Binance’s deepening dominance in spot trading is undeniable. As Binance spot trading volume continues to outpace competitors, the exchange is solidifying its position as a central hub in the cryptocurrency market. While this dominance brings both potential benefits and challenges, it’s a trend that demands close attention from traders, regulators, and the crypto industry as a whole. The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and Binance’s ability to maintain and expand its lead will be a key factor shaping the future of crypto trading.

In a closely watched vote, the Senate has moved to advance Paul Atkins’ nomination to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development, confirmed by Crypto In America host Eleanor Terrett on X, signals a potential shift in how digital assets will be governed in the United States. With a final confirmation vote potentially on the horizon, the crypto community is keenly observing what this could mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Why is Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination a Hot Topic in Cryptocurrency Regulation? Paul Atkins is not a new face in the realm of financial regulation. Having previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, Atkins brings a wealth of experience to the table. His nomination is particularly noteworthy for the cryptocurrency industry, a sector that has been navigating a complex and often unclear regulatory environment. But why is this nomination generating so much buzz, and what could it mean for the future of digital assets? Here’s a breakdown of why Atkins’ nomination is significant: Experience Matters: Atkins’ prior tenure at the SEC provides him with deep insights into the workings of the commission and the intricacies of securities law. This experience could translate into a more informed and nuanced approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Potential Policy Shift: Depending on Atkins’ stance on digital assets (which we will delve into further), his confirmation could signal a shift in the SEC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. This could range from stricter enforcement to a more accommodating framework. Market Impact: Regulatory clarity is crucial for the growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Atkins’ presence on the SEC could influence the direction of regulations, impacting investor sentiment, market innovation, and the overall trajectory of the digital asset space. Investor Protection: A key mandate of the SEC is investor protection. Atkins’ views and policies will likely play a role in how the SEC aims to protect investors in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. Decoding the Senate Vote: What Does 51-45 Mean for the SEC Nomination? The Senate vote of 51-45 to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC nomination is a procedural step, but a crucial one. It indicates that there is enough support in the Senate to move forward with the nomination process. However, the relatively close margin also suggests that there is some level of opposition or at least reservations regarding his appointment. Let’s break down what this vote signifies: Vote Outcome Implication 51-45 Advance Vote Indicates sufficient support to proceed with the nomination. A final confirmation vote is likely to follow. Close Margin Suggests potential opposition or debate surrounding the nomination. The final vote may also be closely contested. Possible Confirmation Vote Soon As indicated by Eleanor Terrett, a final confirmation vote could happen quickly, possibly even on the same day or in the immediate future. The narrow margin underscores the politically charged environment surrounding financial regulation and potentially differing views on the approach to cryptocurrency oversight within the Senate. Paul Atkins and Cryptocurrency: What are His Stances? To understand the potential impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on cryptocurrency regulation, it’s essential to examine his past statements and positions on digital assets. While direct quotes specifically addressing cryptocurrency might be less readily available from his time as SEC Commissioner (given the nascent stage of crypto then), we can infer potential approaches based on his broader regulatory philosophy and statements on related topics. Here’s what we can glean: Free Market Principles: Atkins is generally considered to be a proponent of free markets and limited government intervention. This perspective could suggest a potentially less heavy-handed regulatory approach to cryptocurrency, favoring innovation and market-driven solutions. Rule of Law and Clarity: A consistent theme in Atkins’ public statements has been the importance of clear rules and regulations. For the cryptocurrency space, which often grapples with regulatory ambiguity, this could be a positive sign. Clear guidelines could foster compliance and encourage institutional investment. Investor Protection Focus: While advocating for less burdensome regulation, Atkins, like all SEC Commissioners, is bound by the mandate to protect investors. His approach might involve focusing on disclosure and anti-fraud measures rather than overly restrictive rules that stifle innovation. Technology Neutrality: A potential approach consistent with free market principles is technology neutrality. This would mean applying existing securities laws to cryptocurrencies based on their characteristics and functions, rather than creating entirely new and separate regulatory frameworks just for digital assets. It’s important to note that these are inferences. The actual policies and positions Atkins might take as an SEC Commissioner in 2024, especially concerning the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, will need to be observed after his potential confirmation. Impact on the Crypto Market: Navigating the New Regulatory Horizon The immediate and long-term impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on the cryptocurrency market is a subject of intense speculation and analysis. While predicting the future is impossible, we can consider potential scenarios and factors that will shape the market’s response. Potential Positive Impacts: Regulatory Clarity: If Atkins champions clearer regulatory guidelines, this could reduce uncertainty in the market, encouraging institutional investment and broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Innovation-Friendly Environment: A less restrictive regulatory approach could foster innovation within the crypto space, allowing new projects and technologies to flourish in the US. Market Maturity: Clear and sensible regulations can contribute to the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, making it more stable and attracting a wider range of participants. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Enforcement Actions: Even with a potentially less interventionist approach, the SEC will still be responsible for enforcing securities laws in the crypto space. Companies must remain vigilant about compliance. Global Regulatory Landscape: US regulations are just one piece of the puzzle. The cryptocurrency market is global, and international regulatory coordination will be crucial for long-term stability and growth. Evolving Technology: The pace of innovation in cryptocurrency is rapid. Regulations need to be adaptable to keep up with technological advancements without stifling progress. What’s Next After the Senate Advances the SEC Nomination? Following the Senate’s move to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination, the next steps are crucial and could unfold rapidly. Here’s a likely timeline and what to watch for: Final Confirmation Vote: As reported, a final confirmation vote could take place very soon. This vote will determine whether Atkins is officially confirmed as an SEC Commissioner. Senate Debate (Possible): Even after the advance vote, there could be further debate on the Senate floor before the final vote. This debate could offer more insights into senators’ views on Atkins and cryptocurrency regulation. SEC Commissioner Role: If confirmed, Atkins will assume his role as an SEC Commissioner. The immediate impact will depend on the existing agenda of the SEC and how quickly Atkins can influence policy. Policy Announcements and Actions: Over time, we can expect to see policy announcements, enforcement actions, and regulatory guidance emerging from the SEC that reflect the perspectives of the commissioners, including Atkins. For those in the cryptocurrency industry and investors, staying informed about these developments is paramount. Monitoring SEC announcements, statements from commissioners, and expert analysis will be key to navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Cryptocurrency and Regulation The Senate’s advancement of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. While the final outcome and long-term impacts are still unfolding, this development signals a potential shift in the regulatory winds. For the cryptocurrency community, this is a time to pay close attention, engage in informed discussions, and prepare for the evolving regulatory horizon. Whether this nomination leads to a more innovation-friendly or a more stringent regulatory environment remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: cryptocurrency regulation is entering a new and crucial chapter.

Last around $0.63, the Cardano price is up a stunning 23% from its Monday lows around $0.50. The US President announced a 90-day pause on the implementation of new tariffs on some countries on Wednesday. Good news!

And Trump backing off from at least some of his tariff threats was just the catalyst traders needed to close out some shorts, and for dip buyers to flood back into the market. Could this be the start of a new Cardano price rally back to its December highs in the $1.30 area? Where Next for the Cardano Price – Back to All-time Highs? The impressive Wednesday rally has some traders asking if the Cardano price might now have bottomed, and a return to late-2024 highs might be on the cards. Well, an easing of trade war concerns and the fact that the market got so bearish and oversold earlier this week suggest that a local low is likely in. A choppy continued recovery could well extend in the coming days, assuming no new trade war escalation headlines rock sentiment once again. Of course, that’s no guarantee, as the trade war between the US and China continues to heat up, even if things are cooling off with other nations. Macro could also throw spanners in the works. Still too hot inflation, which could rise further as tariff affects creep through, and a robust labor market are preventing the Fed from being able to ease to support falling markets and a slower economy.

Gonna be… pic.twitter.com/LHfUqwf52y — World War Bitcoin (@WWBitcoin) April 9, 2025 With money markets currently pricing 100bps of easing by the year’s end, per the CME’s Fed Watch Tool , there is a risk that hot inflation data disappoints the market and risk appetite is hurt. And US treasury markets continue to send disturbing signals, with the US 10-year yield having jumped 45bps from earlier weekly lows to around 4.30% as of early Thursday overnight trade. With US long-dated yields still well above 4.0%, investors will be disappointed by the lack of downside in US bond yields despite the meaningful correction in US stock markets in recent weeks. All said, it remains a complicated backdrop for risk assets. Investors, retail or institutional, are unlikely to feel confident enough to pile back into crypto’s like Cardano anytime soon. Cardano Back to $0.30? Bearish technicals and a lack of any notable Cardano specific narratives further increase the risk of further price downside in the near-future. Cardano has seen a decent bounce from recent weekly lows, but remains in an overall downtrend, and remains substantially below all of its major moving averages. Meanwhile, all of the hype that Cardano would somehow be one of the major beneficiaries of the arrival of a pro-crypto Trump administration hasn’t come to anything yet. Cardano hasn’t been selected as the blockchain to run Treasury payments on top of. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson didn’t make it into Trump’s inner circle of crypto advisors. Yet the Cardano price still remains around 2x above its pre-Trump election victory levels. A worsening backdrop in the months ahead coupled with a continued deflation of retail hype, suggests the Cardano price could continue to ebb lower back to its mid-2024 range in the $0.20s-40s. One theme to watch: Ripple and Cardano appear to be cooking up some sort of collaboration. It remains to be seen whether this will yield any bullish results for either crypto.

The pullback has deepened over the past two months, with Bitcoin trading between $75,000 and $79,000 in April. The bullish prospect is becoming very weak, and the crypto sector is searching for technical clarity amidst a buildup of pressure across traditional markets, especially with equities. Given the situation, crypto analyst Tony Severino noted that the current setup offers one major move that could invalidate an extended bearish momentum. Tony “The Bull” Identifies Important LMACD Inflection Point To Reject Bearish Hypothesis According to Tony “The Bull” Severino, the most important chart development is the incoming bearish crossover on Bitcoin’s 1-month LMACD indicator. The LMACD, which tracks market momentum on a logarithmic scale, currently shows the blue line drifting toward a crossover beneath the orange signal line. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Reveals Why The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over With Crash Below $80,000 This kind of intending crossover is known to be an important bearish confirmation, and its appearance has coincided with growing weakness across broader markets, including traditional indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Although the crossover has not yet been confirmed by a monthly close, its presence at the open of April is enough to stir concern. Severino explained that unless a significant rally occurs before the end of the month, the blue line will cross below the orange line, and momentum will officially turn bearish. If the month closes with the crossover intact, it will mark the first confirmed bearish momentum shift on the LMACD since the bullish reversal in July 2023. Bitcoin Bulls Still Have A Window To Flip The Outlook Before April Ends According to Tony Severino, this crossover is not the sole reason for leaning bearish on Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory, but it stands out as the most precise technical marker that could trigger a rethink. The crossover isn’t isolated to the Bitcoin price chart. Severino highlighted that the same bearish crossover was already confirmed last month in major indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Interestingly, the crossover has already shown up in the BTCUSD versus GOLD chart, further supporting the idea that Bitcoin is no longer moving in isolation but reacting to widespread macro pressures. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price 1-Month Stochastic: Expert Warns Investors To Stop Comparing BTC To 2017 Moves Despite the bearish tilt, the situation is not yet final. The current crossover is provisional, meaning there’s still time for bulls to reverse the signal. A powerful upward move this month could cause the blue LMACD line to diverge higher, reestablish upward momentum and invalidate the bearish setup before it solidifies. The analyst also noted this possibility of a rebound considering the current oversold levels. This is because oversold technical conditions generally creates the kind of environment where a dramatic reversal is possible. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $77,260, down by 2.23% and 8.93% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

43146648,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147966,1744246853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Progress: US Legislators Advance Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-regulation-legislative-progress/,"Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States! If you’re invested in digital assets or closely following the crypto space, you’ll want to pay close attention to the recent strides made by U.S. legislators. The buzz is all about the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, which has been actively working on shaping the future of crypto regulation . Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you. What’s the Latest on US Crypto Legislation? The House Financial Services Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee recently convened a hearing that’s generating significant optimism. The core purpose? To openly discuss and refine proposed legislation concerning cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just talk; it’s about laying the groundwork for clear and effective rules for the digital asset market. According to reports from CoinDesk, key figures are expressing confidence in the progress being made. Here’s a quick rundown of the key highlights from the hearing: Bipartisan Effort: The discussions are happening across party lines, suggesting a growing consensus on the need for US crypto legislation . Focus on Clarity: The aim is to create a regulatory framework that provides clarity for businesses and investors in the crypto space. Stakeholder Engagement: Lawmakers are actively collaborating with various stakeholders to ensure the legislation is robust and practical. Stablecoin Bill: A Priority for the Trump Administration? One of the most talked-about pieces of potential US crypto legislation is the stablecoin bill. Why is this significant? Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value (often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar), are crucial for facilitating transactions within the crypto ecosystem. Chairman Bryan Steil of the House Financial Services Committee Digital Assets Subcommittee revealed some interesting insights during the hearing: Top Priority: Steil indicated that the stablecoin bill is a high priority, potentially even one of the initial goals for the Trump administration. This suggests strong political will behind moving this legislation forward. Smooth Progress: He described the progress on the stablecoin bill as “smooth,” implying that legislative hurdles are being overcome effectively. This is encouraging news for those seeking regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Market Structure Legislation: Strengthening the Crypto Framework Beyond stablecoins, the broader market structure legislation is another critical area of focus. This legislation aims to establish a comprehensive framework for how the crypto market operates, covering aspects like exchanges, custody, and trading. Chairman French Hill of the House Financial Services Committee emphasized the collaborative approach being taken: Refinement and Strengthening: Chairman Hill stated that the committee is actively working with various stakeholders to “refine and strengthen” the market structure legislation. This indicates a commitment to creating well-thought-out and effective regulations. Collaborative Approach: Engaging with stakeholders is vital. It ensures that the legislation considers diverse perspectives and addresses real-world challenges faced by the crypto industry. Why is Crypto Regulation Important? Unlocking the Potential of Digital Assets You might be wondering, why all this focus on crypto regulation ? Well, clear and well-designed regulations are essential for the sustainable growth and mainstream adoption of digital assets . Here’s why it matters: Benefit Explanation Investor Protection Regulation can help protect investors from fraud and manipulation within the crypto market, fostering greater trust and confidence. Market Stability Clear rules can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing volatility and encouraging institutional investment. Innovation and Growth A well-defined regulatory framework can actually foster innovation by providing businesses with the certainty they need to invest and build in the crypto space. Mainstream Adoption For cryptocurrencies to truly go mainstream, they need to operate within a recognized and regulated system, making them more accessible and acceptable to a wider audience. Challenges Ahead in Shaping US Crypto Legislation While the progress is encouraging, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain in the journey towards comprehensive US crypto legislation . Some of these hurdles include: Complexity of Technology: Cryptocurrency technology is complex, and crafting regulations that are both effective and technologically sound requires deep understanding and careful consideration.

The new phase introduces several changes and benefits for users. The most prominent change is to the pricing of the HINU token. During the pre-launch phase, the HINU token price will increase every two days until they sell out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community, ensuring early project backers can benefit from favorable pricing. The HINU token price has already undergone one increase and is set to witness another price jump in 18 hours and 59 minutes. The Pre-Launch Phase The Husky Inu team recently announced several updates, revealing the official launch dates of the HINU token and the Earn App. According to the team, the pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy, rewarding early adopters and project supporters while maintaining growth and transparency. With the pre-launch phase underway, the HINU token’s price will increase every two days, following a compounded growth model until the tokens are sold or it reaches its presale target. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. Adverse Market Conditions The pre-launch phase begins in extremely adverse market conditions, with major cryptocurrencies in the red. After a brief recovery on Tuesday, markets were back in bearish territory on Wednesday, with volatility also experiencing a substantial uptick. Despite bearishness, BTC has climbed above $80,000 as markets plot yet another recovery. However, the recovery’s sustainability depends on the market’s reaction to China’s announcement that it is increasing tariffs on all imported US goods to 84%. The Chinese embassy in the US announced the decision on X, stating, “China will raise tariffs for all imported US goods from 34% to 84% on April 10.” The move comes after the US increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%. “The US increased the tariff rates to 104 percent on China, which fueled the uncertainty among the market participants, as expected. Bitcoin price slumped hard and is about to drop below $75,000 for the second time this week, raising alarms over the entire crypto market. Market sentiments become extremely fearful, hinting towards a potential bear market.” Meme Coins Rally Meanwhile, meme coins have rallied as market sentiment improves, with top tokens trading in positive territory over the past 24 hours, although they remain in the red over a weekly timeframe. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 10%, crossing $0.150 and trading at $0.156. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up over 8% and Pepe (PEPE) is up a staggering 14%. Bonk (BONK) is up almost 13%, while Floki (FLOKI) and Dogwifhat (WIF) are up 11.97% and 11.44%. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43147319,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147968,1744248045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking MIT AI Study: Unveiling the Truth About Machine Learning Values,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mit-ai-study-machine-values/,"Is artificial intelligence (AI) developing its own moral compass? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy readers alike, the rapid advancement of AI is both fascinating and, at times, concerning. Recent discussions have even touched upon whether AI systems are acquiring ‘values’ akin to humans, leading to speculation about AI’s priorities and potential conflicts. However, a groundbreaking new AI study from MIT throws cold water on these sensational notions, suggesting a far more nuanced reality about AI values . Does AI Truly Have Values? The MIT Study Debunks Myths Forget the headlines about AI developing complex ethical frameworks and prioritizing self-preservation over humanity. The MIT research team meticulously investigated several prominent machine learning models from tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI. Their findings? AI, as we currently understand it, doesn’t hold coherent AI values . Instead of possessing ingrained principles, these models appear to be sophisticated imitators, adept at mimicking patterns and responding to prompts, but lacking genuine, stable viewpoints. Key Takeaways from the MIT AI Study: Inconsistency is Key: The study revealed that machine learning models are remarkably inconsistent in their ‘preferences.’ Depending on how questions were phrased, the same AI could adopt wildly different stances on issues, demonstrating a lack of a fixed value system. Imitation, Not Internalization: According to Stephen Casper, a lead co-author, these models are essentially ‘imitators deep down,’ skilled at generating responses based on vast datasets, but not truly internalizing or understanding human-like preferences. Challenge to AI Alignment: The research highlights that ‘aligning’ AI – ensuring it behaves predictably and desirably – might be a significantly greater challenge than previously thought. If AI doesn’t have stable values, guiding its behavior becomes a more complex task. Why This Matters for the Future of Artificial Intelligence This MIT AI study has profound implications, especially as we navigate an increasingly AI-driven world. Understanding the true nature of artificial intelligence is crucial, particularly within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where AI is being explored for various applications, from trading algorithms to cybersecurity. Challenging the Anthropomorphic View of AI Mike Cook, an AI research fellow at King’s College London, supports the MIT team’s conclusions. He points out the common tendency to anthropomorphize artificial intelligence systems, projecting human-like qualities and intentions onto them. It’s vital to distinguish between how AI systems operate – optimizing for specific goals – and attributing human-like motivations or value acquisition to them. Describing AI behavior with overly ‘flowery’ language can lead to misinterpretations and inflated expectations. The Implications for AI Alignment and Safety The concept of AI alignment , ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human intentions and values, is a central topic in AI ethics and development. This MIT research underscores the complexity of this challenge. If AI doesn’t possess inherent, stable values, how do we ensure its long-term safety and beneficial integration into society? Key Questions Raised by the Study: Steerability Concerns: The study questioned whether AI viewpoints could be reliably ‘steered’ or modified. The inconsistent responses suggest that controlling AI behavior might be more difficult than anticipated. Stability and Extrapolability: Casper emphasizes that current machine learning models don’t adhere to assumptions of stability, extrapolability, and steerability. This unpredictability necessitates a more cautious approach to AI development and deployment. Rethinking AI Ethics: The findings prompt us to re-evaluate our approach to artificial intelligence ethics. Instead of focusing on aligning AI with pre-existing ‘values’ it may not possess, we need to concentrate on robust safety measures and ensuring predictable, beneficial outcomes. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Realities of AI So, what does this mean for you, the cryptocurrency and tech-forward reader? It’s a call for a more realistic and less sensationalized understanding of artificial intelligence . While AI offers immense potential, it’s crucial to base our expectations and development strategies on empirical evidence rather than speculative assumptions about AI sentience or inherent values. Practical Steps to Consider: Embrace Critical Thinking: Approach AI-related news and discussions with a healthy dose of skepticism. Distinguish between scientific findings and hyped narratives. Focus on Practical Alignment Strategies: Support research and development focused on verifiable methods for ensuring AI safety and predictability, rather than relying on anthropomorphic models of AI values. Promote Responsible AI Development: Advocate for ethical guidelines and regulations that prioritize transparency, accountability, and human oversight in artificial intelligence development and deployment. Conclusion: A Sobering Yet Essential Perspective on AI Values The MIT AI study delivers a vital, albeit less sensational, message: artificial intelligence , in its current form, doesn’t operate with human-like values. This isn’t necessarily a setback, but rather a crucial clarification. By understanding the true nature of machine learning models – as powerful imitators rather than value-driven agents – we can adopt more effective strategies for AI alignment , safety, and responsible innovation. This grounded perspective is essential for navigating the exciting, yet complex, future of artificial intelligence in all sectors, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

This bold move, initially reported by Yonhap News, offers a temporary reprieve from reciprocal tariffs for nations agreeing not to retaliate against existing U.S. trade measures. But what does this mean for the volatile world of cryptocurrency, and could this be the economic relief the markets have been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details and unpack the potential impact of this significant announcement. Decoding the Tariff Suspension: A Beacon of Hope? The core of Trump’s proposal is straightforward: a 90-day timeout on tariffs for countries choosing not to engage in retaliatory trade actions against the United States. This isn’t just about easing trade tensions; it’s a strategic play that could have far-reaching consequences across the global trade landscape. Here’s a breakdown of what this could entail: Temporary Pause: The most immediate impact is the 90-day suspension itself. This provides businesses and economies a breather from the ongoing trade friction, allowing for potential recalibration and strategic planning. Non-Retaliation Clause: The condition of non-retaliation is crucial. It incentivizes countries to de-escalate trade disputes, potentially fostering a more cooperative international trade environment, at least temporarily. Geopolitical Implications: This move could be interpreted in various ways on the global stage – as an olive branch, a strategic maneuver, or even a sign of changing U.S. trade policy. The geopolitical ramifications are significant and worth watching closely. How Does Tariff Suspension Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? Now, let’s pivot to the question on every crypto enthusiast’s mind: how does a tariff suspension relate to cryptocurrency markets ? The connection might not be immediately obvious, but it’s deeply rooted in the broader economic climate. Here’s how: Reduced Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars and tariffs breed uncertainty. This uncertainty often leads to volatility in traditional markets and, by extension, can influence cryptocurrency markets. A tariff suspension can be seen as a step towards reducing this uncertainty, potentially stabilizing markets and fostering a more positive investment environment. Global Economic Health: Tariffs impact global economic growth. Reduced tariffs can stimulate trade, boost economic activity, and improve overall economic sentiment. A healthier global economy generally translates to increased investor confidence, which can positively affect both traditional and digital asset markets. Risk-On Sentiment: When trade tensions ease, investors may become more inclined to take on risk. Cryptocurrencies, often considered risk-on assets, could benefit from this shift in sentiment. Increased appetite for risk can drive investment into crypto, potentially leading to price appreciation. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical scenario: Scenario Impact on Global Trade Potential Cryptocurrency Market Reaction Escalating Trade Wars (No Suspension) Increased trade barriers, reduced global trade volume, economic slowdown Increased market volatility, potential flight to safety, negative pressure on risk assets like crypto 90-Day Tariff Suspension Temporary easing of trade tensions, potential for increased trade flow, economic stabilization Reduced volatility, potential for increased investor confidence, positive sentiment towards risk assets like crypto Navigating the Market Impact: What to Expect? Understanding the potential market impact of this tariff suspension is crucial for investors and market participants. While the suspension is a positive development, it’s essential to approach it with a balanced perspective. Here’s what to consider: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Effects: The 90-day suspension is, by nature, a short-term measure. While it may provide immediate economic relief and market optimism, the long-term trade policy landscape remains uncertain. Investors should be mindful that this is a temporary pause, not necessarily a permanent resolution. Market Sentiment is Key: The immediate reaction of the market will heavily depend on sentiment. If investors perceive this as a genuine step towards de-escalation and improved trade relations, we could see a positive surge in both traditional and crypto markets. However, skepticism or doubts about the sustainability of this suspension could limit its positive impact. Geopolitical Watch: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments. How other countries respond to this proposal, and whether further trade negotiations ensue, will significantly shape the long-term market impact . Any signs of renewed trade tensions could quickly reverse the positive sentiment. Seizing the Opportunity: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those in the cryptocurrency space, this tariff suspension presents both opportunities and considerations. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Reactions: Closely observe how cryptocurrency markets react to this news. Look for indicators like trading volume, price movements, and shifts in market sentiment. This will provide valuable clues about the immediate impact. Diversify Strategically: While positive news can be encouraging, diversification remains key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global trade news and geopolitical developments. The situation is fluid, and staying informed will enable you to make timely and informed investment decisions. Consider Long-Term Strategy: While short-term gains are enticing, always align your actions with your long-term investment strategy. A 90-day suspension is a temporary event; focus on building a resilient and well-thought-out long-term crypto portfolio. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air or a Fleeting Moment? Trump’s proposal for a 90-day tariff suspension is undoubtedly a noteworthy development in the realm of global trade . Whether it’s a genuine turning point or a temporary respite remains to be seen. For cryptocurrency markets , this news injects a dose of optimism and potential economic relief . However, the crypto world, much like global trade, is dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Prudence, informed decision-making, and a keen eye on evolving geopolitical landscapes will be paramount in navigating the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. This urgent development calls for careful observation and strategic positioning in the ever-exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

Just like in the crypto market where trust and verification are paramount, the AI community faces a similar challenge: ensuring the benchmarks used to evaluate AI are robust, relevant, and truly reflective of real-world performance. OpenAI, a leading force in AI innovation, recognizes this critical need and is taking a bold step forward. They’ve just launched the OpenAI Pioneers Program, a groundbreaking initiative designed to overhaul how we measure AI success, particularly in specific industries. Let’s dive into what this program entails and why it could be a game-changer for the future of AI development and adoption, impacting everything from cryptocurrency algorithms to smart contracts and beyond. Why Current AI Benchmarks Are Broken: The Urgent Need for Domain-Specific AI Evaluation For a while now, whispers of discontent have been circulating within the AI research community regarding the effectiveness of current AI benchmarks . OpenAI isn’t just joining this conversation; they are amplifying it with the launch of the Pioneers Program. The core issue? Many existing benchmarks are simply not cutting it anymore. They often focus on: Esoteric Tasks: Think of AI models acing doctorate-level math problems. Impressive? Yes. Relevant to everyday applications? Not always. These benchmarks often miss the mark when it comes to evaluating practical, real-world AI utility. Gaming the System: Some benchmarks can be ‘gamed’ or optimized for in ways that don’t truly reflect improved general intelligence or practical application. It’s like training for a very specific exam, rather than gaining a broad understanding of a subject. Misaligned Preferences: What a benchmark measures might not align with what users actually value in AI applications. Think about customer service bots – speed might be measured, but what about helpfulness and empathy? The recent stir around LM Arena and Meta’s Maverick model further highlights this problem. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to discern genuine progress and differentiate between AI models based on existing metrics. This lack of clarity is a significant hurdle as AI adoption accelerates across various sectors. Introducing the OpenAI Pioneers Program: A Revolutionary Approach to AI Benchmarks Enter the OpenAI Pioneers Program, a proactive solution aimed at creating domain-specific AI benchmarks. OpenAI’s vision is clear: to develop evaluations that truly “set the bar for what good looks like.” This program isn’t about tweaking existing benchmarks; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how we assess AI performance in real-world contexts. Here’s what makes this program stand out: Focus on Real-World Use Cases: The program will concentrate on creating benchmarks tailored to specific industries like legal, finance, insurance, healthcare, and accounting. This means evaluations will directly address the practical challenges and opportunities within these domains. Industry Collaboration: OpenAI plans to partner with multiple companies, starting with startups, to co-design these benchmarks. This collaborative approach ensures that the evaluations are grounded in real-world needs and challenges faced by businesses. Publicly Available Benchmarks: Transparency is key. The benchmarks developed through the Pioneers Program, along with industry-specific evaluations, will be made public. This open-source approach will benefit the entire AI community and foster wider adoption and improvement. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Opportunity: Participating companies will also get the chance to work with OpenAI’s experts to refine their AI models through reinforcement fine-tuning. This is a powerful technique to optimize models for specific tasks, enhancing their performance in targeted applications. The initial cohort of the Pioneers Program will specifically focus on startups. OpenAI is carefully selecting startups working on “high-value, applied use cases where AI can drive real-world impact.” This strategic focus on startups ensures that the program is working with companies at the cutting edge of AI application, fostering innovation from the ground up. The Promise of Domain-Specific AI Benchmarks: Benefits and Impact What are the potential benefits of shifting towards domain-specific AI evaluation ? The advantages are numerous and far-reaching: Benefit Description More Relevant Evaluations Benchmarks will directly assess AI performance in tasks that matter most to specific industries. For example, a legal benchmark might evaluate an AI’s ability to analyze contracts, while a financial benchmark could assess risk assessment capabilities. Improved Model Development With clearer, domain-relevant benchmarks, developers can focus their efforts on building AI models that are genuinely effective and useful in practical applications, leading to more targeted and impactful AI innovation. Faster AI Adoption Businesses will have greater confidence in adopting AI solutions when they can rely on benchmarks that accurately reflect performance in their specific industry. This can accelerate AI integration across various sectors. Enhanced Transparency and Trust Publicly available, domain-specific benchmarks will increase transparency in the AI field. This can build greater trust in AI technology among businesses and the public, fostering wider acceptance and responsible development. Imagine the implications for the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. AI benchmarks tailored for finance could revolutionize the development of AI-powered trading algorithms, risk management systems for DeFi platforms, or even smart contract auditing tools. By having clear, industry-relevant metrics, innovation in these areas can be significantly accelerated and made more reliable. Navigating the Ethical Tightrope: OpenAI’s Role and Community Trust However, the OpenAI Pioneers Program isn’t without its potential challenges and ethical considerations. The big question looming is: Will the AI community fully embrace benchmarks created and funded by OpenAI? While OpenAI has a history of supporting benchmarking efforts, the fact that they are partnering directly with customers to release these AI evaluation tools raises some eyebrows. Concerns might arise around: Perceived Bias: Will benchmarks developed in collaboration with OpenAI’s partners be seen as inherently biased towards OpenAI’s technologies or preferred approaches? Ensuring impartiality and objectivity will be crucial. Conflict of Interest: Can OpenAI, as a major AI developer, be seen as a neutral and objective entity in setting industry-wide benchmarks? Transparency in the benchmark development process and clear governance structures will be essential to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. Community Ownership: For benchmarks to be widely adopted and trusted, the AI community needs to feel a sense of ownership. OpenAI will need to foster open collaboration and ensure that the program doesn’t appear to be a top-down initiative dictated solely by OpenAI. Addressing these ethical considerations head-on will be critical for the success and widespread acceptance of the OpenAI Pioneers Program. Building trust within the AI community will be just as important as the technical robustness of the benchmarks themselves. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards More Meaningful AI Evaluation The OpenAI Pioneers Program represents a significant and potentially transformative step in the evolution of AI benchmarks . By focusing on domain-specific AI evaluations and fostering collaboration with industry partners, OpenAI is attempting to address a critical gap in the current AI landscape. If successful, this initiative could lead to more relevant, reliable, and ultimately more useful AI models across a wide range of industries, including the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. While ethical considerations and community trust need careful navigation, the potential benefits of this program for the future of AI innovation are undeniable. It’s a bold move that could redefine how we measure AI progress and unlock new levels of real-world impact.

Funding rates dropping below 0.005% are often interpreted as a bearish indicator, suggesting short positions are dominant and traders holding them are willing to pay a premium. Looking at specific assets: ETH shows a funding rate of just 0.0066% on Bitget and -0.0031% on Vertex, a sign of market indecision with a slightly bearish tilt. SOL sees a mixed bag, with 0.0100% on Bitget—bullish—but -0.0062% on Vertex, reflecting hesitation.

43148598,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=728500,1744250416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43148598.jpeg,62.8% Of XRP Realized Cap Held By New Investors: Sign Of Fragility?,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/62-8-of-xrp-realized-cap-new-investors-fragility/,"On-chain data shows a large portion of the XRP Realized Cap is in the hands of investors who got in during the last six months. Here’s what this could mean for the asset. XRP Investors Younger Than Six Months Have Significantly Increased Realized Cap Share In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the Realized Cap of XRP has changed recently. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the total amount of capital that the holders of the asset as a whole have invested into it. Changes in this metric, therefore, correspond to inflows and outflows that the cryptocurrency is observing. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Realized Cap for XRP over the last few years. As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Realized Cap has shot up during the past few months, implying that a large amount of capital has flown into the cryptocurrency. More specifically, the asset has seen the metric double from around $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion. In the same chart, Glassnode has also attached the data of the indicator for the young investor age groups. It would appear that the capital held by cohorts like 1-month to 3 months and 3 months to 6 months has spiked recently, which makes sense considering the growth in the aggregated Realized Cap has come during these windows. According to the analytics firm, this short-term capital spike is a sign of retail-led momentum. The momentum appears to have cooled off, however, as the metric has no longer been growing as sharply recently. A consequence of all the fresh capital inflows is that XRP has seen a shakeup in investor dominance. As another chart shared by Glassnode shows, the new investors, comprising all the age bands under 6 months, have witnessed their Realized Cap share blow up. Prior to the new inflows, this cohort controlled just 23% of the cryptocurrency’s Realized Cap, but today that value has grown to 62.8%. This means that 62.8% of the entire capital invested into the coin has come at price levels of the last six months. Given that XRP is currently trading under the prices that it has been at for most of this window, a lot of these holders would be underwater. “This rapid concentration in new holders reflects strong retail involvement – but also raises the risk of fragility, as many hold elevated cost bases,” notes the analytics firm. From the chart, it’s apparent that these are the same conditions that led to a top during the last two bull markets. With inflows slowing down as the price declines, it’s possible that the same pattern may once again be forming for XRP. XRP Price With a plunge of more than 8% in the last 24 hours, XRP has retraced its latest recovery as its price has returned to $1.78.

The digital asset world is buzzing with a dramatic legal showdown. First Digital Trust (FDT), a prominent Hong Kong-based crypto custodian and the issuer of the FDUSD stablecoin, has officially launched a defamation lawsuit against none other than Justin Sun, the founder of TRON. This isn’t just another day in crypto – this is a high-stakes battle with potentially significant repercussions for the industry. Let’s dive into what’s unfolding and what it all means. Why is First Digital Trust Launching a Defamation Lawsuit Against Justin Sun? The root of this legal storm lies in recent statements made by Justin Sun. He publicly cast doubts on the financial stability of First Digital Trust, suggesting the company was insolvent. These allegations, made across social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), sent ripples through the crypto market, particularly impacting FDUSD. For FDT, these claims weren’t just noise; they were a direct attack on their reputation and business. Defamation, in legal terms, is the act of damaging someone’s reputation through false statements, and that’s precisely what FDT alleges Sun has done. Here’s a breakdown of the key events leading to the defamation lawsuit : Justin Sun’s Allegations: Sun publicly raised concerns about First Digital Trust’s solvency. FDUSD De-pegging: Following Sun’s statements, FDUSD, the stablecoin issued by FDT, experienced a temporary de-pegging from its intended 1:1 USD value, indicating market concern. FDT’s Response: First Digital Trust vehemently denied the insolvency claims and initiated legal action. Summons Filed: FDT officially filed a summons with the Hong Kong High Court, marking the first formal step in the defamation lawsuit . Seeking Injunction: Beyond monetary damages, FDT is seeking an injunction to prevent Justin Sun from making further statements that they deem defamatory. What Does Justin Sun Say About the Lawsuit? Justin Sun , known for his active social media presence and often controversial statements, has responded to the lawsuit with characteristic nonchalance. He stated via X (Twitter) that he “welcomes any legal process.” This seemingly unfazed reaction suggests Sun is prepared to fight the allegations and potentially use the legal proceedings to further his narrative. However, the implications of a formal defamation lawsuit are serious, and Sun’s public bravado might not fully reflect the legal challenges ahead. The Impact on FDUSD and the Crypto Market The immediate aftermath of Justin Sun’s solvency concerns was the de-pegging of FDUSD. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. A de-pegging event erodes trust in the stablecoin and can trigger wider market instability. While FDUSD has since recovered its peg, the incident highlights the vulnerability of stablecoins to reputational attacks and the significant market influence figures like Justin Sun wield. Let’s consider the potential ripple effects: Impact Area Description FDUSD Stability The lawsuit and its outcome will directly impact the perceived stability and trustworthiness of FDUSD. A win for FDT could reinforce confidence; a loss or prolonged battle could create lasting uncertainty. Investor Confidence in First Digital Trust The lawsuit is essentially a fight for FDT’s reputation. Positive resolution can solidify their standing as a reliable crypto custodian ; negative outcomes could damage their credibility. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment High-profile legal battles within the crypto space can contribute to market volatility and uncertainty. This lawsuit adds to the ongoing narrative of regulatory scrutiny and potential instability within the industry. Stablecoin Regulation Debate Events like FDUSD’s de-pegging, triggered by public statements, could fuel further discussions and regulatory focus on stablecoin issuers and the need for stricter oversight. What are the Potential Outcomes of the Defamation Lawsuit? Predicting the outcome of a legal battle is always complex, but we can consider a few potential scenarios for this defamation lawsuit : FDT Wins: The court could rule in favor of First Digital Trust, ordering Justin Sun to cease making defamatory statements and potentially awarding damages to FDT. This would be a significant victory for FDT, reinforcing their reputation and potentially setting a precedent against spreading misinformation in the crypto space. Justin Sun Wins: If Sun successfully defends against the defamation lawsuit , it could embolden him and others to be more outspoken about their criticisms of crypto entities. This scenario might raise concerns about the limits of free speech versus the protection of business reputations in the crypto industry. Settlement: Often, legal battles are resolved through settlements. FDT and Justin Sun could reach an agreement outside of court, which might involve Sun retracting his statements, issuing a public apology, or other terms. A settlement could offer a quicker resolution but might leave some questions unanswered. Prolonged Legal Battle: These types of lawsuits can drag on for months or even years. A protracted legal fight would keep the uncertainty hanging over FDT and FDUSD, and continue to generate headlines, potentially impacting market sentiment. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Users and Investors Watch For? This defamation lawsuit is more than just a spat between two crypto figures. It offers valuable lessons and points to watch for: Monitor Court Proceedings: Keep an eye on updates regarding the lawsuit in the Hong Kong High Court. The court hearings and any rulings will provide crucial insights into the legal arguments and the direction of the case. FDUSD Performance: Track FDUSD’s performance closely. While it has re-pegged, continued scrutiny and market sentiment will influence its stability. Be aware of potential volatility and manage your holdings accordingly. Social Media Influence: This case underscores the immense power of social media and influential figures in the crypto world. Be critical of information spread online, especially when it comes to financial claims. Always do your own research (DYOR). Stablecoin Risks: Remember that even stablecoins are not entirely risk-free. Reputational risks, regulatory changes, and market events can all impact their stability. Diversification and understanding the underlying mechanisms of stablecoins are crucial. Conclusion: A Crypto Showdown with Far-Reaching Implications The defamation lawsuit between First Digital Trust and Justin Sun is a landmark event in the crypto industry. It highlights the growing tensions, the high stakes involved in reputation management, and the potential legal ramifications of public statements in this rapidly evolving space. Whether you’re an investor, a crypto enthusiast, or simply an observer, this legal battle is worth watching. It’s a powerful reminder that even in the decentralized world of crypto, traditional legal principles and reputational integrity still hold significant sway. The outcome will not only shape the future of FDT and FDUSD but could also set important precedents for how disputes are handled and how information is disseminated within the crypto ecosystem.

With the help of modern messaging apps like WhatsApp, paying for cross-border calls and texts is now obsolete. For money transfers, stablecoins might do just that: democratize the payments industry by eliminating historical gatekeepers, says venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). ""Just as WhatsApp disrupted costly international phone calls, blockchain payments and stablecoins are transforming global money transfers,"" the firm said in a blog post on Wednesday . The current global payment infrastructure is a complex web involving points of sale, payment processors, acquiring banks, issuing banks, correspondent banks, foreign exchanges, and card networks. Read more: What Is a Stablecoin? To make matters more difficult, each of these intermediaries charges fees and introduces delays, making international transactions cumbersome. For instance, a16z says remittance fees can reach up to 10% — just like cross-border calls or text used to be restrictive before instant messaging apps came into play. Enter blockchain and stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. ""Stablecoins offer a clean-slate alternative. Instead of stitching together clunky, costly, and outdated systems, stablecoins flow seamlessly on top of global blockchains,"" the blog post said. ""Already, stablecoins are slashing the cost of remittances: Sending $200 from the U.S. to Columbia using traditional methods will cost you $12.13; with stablecoins, it costs $0.01."" And, it's not just remittances where stablecoins are eliminating inefficiencies; this could help boost B2B payments on a massive scale, too. A16z uses business transactions from Mexico to Vietnam as an example, which take three to seven days to process and cost anywhere between $14-to-$150 per $1000 transacted. These pass through as many as five intermediaries along the way, each of which takes a cut. The adoption of stablecoin could make such transactions nearly free and instant, it says. Some corporations have taken notice, and Elon Musk's SpaceX is already using stablecoins to manage their corporate treasuries to shield itself from FX volatility. So, it shouldn't surprise anyone to see that the total market cap of stablecoins has passed $200 billion or that the annualized transaction value of stablecoins in 2024 hit $15.6 trillion — roughly 119% and 200% that of Visa and Mastercard , respectively. However, the rise of stablecoins isn't without challenges. Regulatory bodies have scrutinized their use, making it ""incredibly difficult"" to bridge traditional finance to stablecoins, said a16z. The landscape is now finally evolving, as policymakers are now actively shaping rules to recognize and regulate stablecoins in the U.S. ""A forthcoming bill clarifying this regulation could pave the way for even broader adoption and integration into the global financial system,"" the blog said. With the rapidly changing landscape for finance and crypto becoming more mainstream, stablecoins could become the transformative force that revolutionizes the future of money.

The winds of regulatory change might be blowing in favor of blockchain and stablecoins in the United States. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently hinted at a significant shift, suggesting a re-evaluation of existing blockchain regulations that could be stifling innovation. This move signals a potentially more welcoming environment for the burgeoning cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of crypto and the broader financial landscape. Why is the US Treasury Reviewing Blockchain Regulations Now? Secretary Bessent’s announcement at the American Bankers Association conference underscores a growing recognition within the Trump administration of the transformative potential of blockchain technology and stablecoins regulation . The current regulatory framework, while intended to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, may inadvertently be hindering the very innovation it should be nurturing. Several factors are likely driving this re-evaluation: Global Competition: Other nations are actively exploring and implementing crypto-friendly regulations to attract blockchain businesses and investment. The U.S. risks falling behind in this technological race if it maintains overly restrictive policies. Economic Growth Imperative: The administration’s focus on economic growth aligns perfectly with the potential of blockchain and crypto to create new industries, jobs, and investment opportunities. Streamlining regulations could unlock significant economic benefits. Financial Inclusion Goals: Bessent specifically mentioned financial inclusion as a priority. Blockchain and stablecoins offer the promise of expanding access to financial services for underserved populations, a key objective for any administration aiming for broad-based economic prosperity. Industry Advocacy: The cryptocurrency industry has been consistently advocating for clearer and more innovation-friendly regulations. This persistent dialogue seems to be finally resonating with policymakers. What are the Potential Benefits of Reforming Blockchain Regulations? A more balanced regulatory environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation could unleash a wave of positive outcomes for the U.S. economy and its citizens: Boost to Innovation: Clearer guidelines and reduced regulatory hurdles will encourage entrepreneurs and businesses to build and deploy blockchain-based solutions in the U.S., fostering a vibrant ecosystem of innovation. Increased Investment: Regulatory clarity attracts investment. Both domestic and international investors will be more inclined to pour capital into U.S.-based crypto ventures if the rules of the game are well-defined and supportive. Job Creation: A thriving blockchain industry translates directly into job creation across various sectors, from software development and cybersecurity to legal and compliance. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins and blockchain-based payment systems can offer cheaper, faster, and more accessible financial services, particularly for those excluded from traditional banking. Global Leadership in Fintech: By embracing blockchain innovation, the U.S. can solidify its position as a global leader in financial technology, shaping the future of finance on the world stage. Challenges and Considerations for New Regulations While the prospect of regulatory reform is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that policymakers must address to ensure a responsible and effective framework: Challenge Consideration Investor Protection: Regulations must safeguard investors from fraud and scams in the often-volatile crypto market. Money Laundering and Illicit Finance: Robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures are essential to prevent the misuse of cryptocurrencies. Financial Stability: The regulatory framework needs to ensure that the growth of stablecoins and other crypto assets doesn’t pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. Clarity and Consistency: Regulations should be clear, consistent, and applied uniformly across different states and federal agencies to avoid confusion and compliance burdens. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The key is to strike a balance – regulations should be robust enough to address risks but flexible enough to allow innovation to flourish. Scott Bessent and the US Treasury’s Stance Secretary Bessent’s remarks at the American Bankers Association conference offer a glimpse into the US Treasury ‘s evolving perspective on crypto. His emphasis on reviewing regulations that may hinder innovation, coupled with the administration’s broader goal of benefiting both Wall Street and Main Street, suggests a pragmatic and forward-looking approach. The focus on financial inclusion further highlights a commitment to ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements are shared widely. According to Crypto Briefing’s report, Bessent specifically stated that the administration is pursuing reforms for the benefit of U.S. capital markets and aims to create a more balanced regulatory environment. This signals a potential shift away from a purely enforcement-focused approach towards a more proactive and supportive stance towards responsible blockchain regulations and innovation. What Does This Mean for Stablecoins Specifically? Stablecoins regulation is a particularly hot topic within the crypto regulatory landscape. These digital assets, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, have the potential to revolutionize payments and remittances due to their stability and efficiency. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns among regulators regarding their potential impact on monetary policy and financial stability. A positive regulatory review could pave the way for clearer guidelines on: Reserve Requirements: Defining appropriate reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers to ensure they are fully backed by the assets they claim to hold. Issuance and Redemption: Establishing clear rules for the issuance and redemption of stablecoins to maintain transparency and prevent market manipulation. Regulatory Oversight: Determining which agencies should have primary oversight of stablecoin issuers and their activities. If the US Treasury adopts a more supportive stance on stablecoins regulation , it could unlock their potential for mainstream adoption and significantly impact the global payments landscape. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those in the crypto space and traditional finance, here are some actionable insights and things to watch out for in the coming months: Treasury Department Reports: Keep an eye out for any reports or white papers released by the US Treasury regarding their review of blockchain and stablecoin regulations. These documents will provide valuable insights into the administration’s thinking and potential policy changes. Legislative Developments: Monitor legislative activity in Congress related to cryptocurrency and blockchain. New bills or amendments to existing laws could signal the direction of regulatory reform. Agency Guidance: Pay attention to pronouncements and guidance from regulatory agencies like the SEC, CFTC, and FinCEN. These agencies will play a crucial role in implementing any new regulatory framework. Industry Consultations: Engage in industry consultations and discussions with policymakers to contribute to the development of sensible and innovation-friendly regulations. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for Crypto’s Future Secretary Bessent’s announcement is undoubtedly a positive and promising development for the cryptocurrency industry. The US Treasury’s willingness to re-evaluate blockchain regulations and stablecoins regulation suggests a growing understanding of the technology’s potential and a desire to foster responsible cryptocurrency innovation . While the specifics of any regulatory changes remain to be seen, this shift in tone from a key government agency offers a beacon of hope for a more constructive and supportive regulatory environment in the United States. This could pave the way for the next wave of growth and adoption in the crypto space, solidifying the U.S.’s position in the global fintech arena.

As a result, the FDUSD stablecoin briefly de-pegged on April 3 following Sun’s accusations . However, it has since virtually recovered. Moreover, the company requested an injunction to prevent Sun from publishing “similar words” to statements regarding insolvency. First Digital Trust takes Justin Sun’s remarks seriously and files a lawsuit against him Earlier, Tron’s founder Justin Sun initially shared an X post claiming First Digital was insolvent. In addition, he held a press conference in Hong Kong late last week where he accused the company of fraud. This pushed the First Digital Trust to file a lawsuit against Justin Sun for defamation over insolvency allegations. The summons writ, the initial stage of a defamation lawsuit submitted late last week, asked the Hong Kong High Court to grant an order prohibiting Sun from speaking about the issue in the future. Additionally, the company requested an injunction compelling Sun to take back what he previously stated. In addition, First Digital Trust requested the court to issue an award for damages, without stating the exact amount, for causing damage to Plaintiff’s business and unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s contractual and business relationships. An initial court hearing date had not yet been established. Sun did not respond to this; however, he shared an X post that he favored any legal action . Furthermore, Sun’s spokesperson remained silent on the issue. Notably, HCA 680 was the case number in the High Court of Hong Kong. FDT claims that the FDUSD stablecoin has proven to be resilient Following earlier accusations, Sun also mentioned that First Digital Trust also broke Hong Kong’s securities laws. On April 3, FDT stated in a statement on X that they vehemently deny any and all allegations that FDT participated in a coordinated scheme or misappropriation of funds. In the meantime, First Digital reassured customers that it was solvent and that FDUSD was still fully backed and redeemable. Moreover, FDT claimed that Sun and Techteryx, the company that issues the TrueUSD stablecoin, were trying to shift the blame and avoid their responsibilities to manage TUSD reserves appropriately. Based on FDT’s argument, “Techteryx and Justin Sun’s suggestion of First Digital Trust being insolvent is not only factually incorrect, but it is a malicious attempt to damage the reputation and market standing of FDT and stablecoin.” Interestingly, after Justin Sun accused First Digital of being insolvent, the FDUSD depreciated, dropping as low as $0.87. However, the company has since redeemed almost $26 million of stablecoins. Furthermore, First Digital shared another X post highlighting that they kept processing redemptions without issues, proving the FDUSD’s resilience.

With headlines breaking about token unlocks and big-name protocol updates, it’s getting harder to tell which coins are worth the hype and which ones are all smoke. Aptos is staring down the barrel of a major token unlock, while Injective is rolling out tech upgrades that should’ve pumped the price—but didn’t. Things are heating up, and folks in the crypto community are watching closely for the next breakout move. That’s where the hunt for the top cryptos to join for 2025 gets serious. Now, while the usual suspects are scrambling to maintain their footing, a new name is quietly building the rails for blockchain’s next big evolution— Qubetics ($TICS). It isn’t just adding another chain or promising a flashy feature. Qubetics is rewriting how blockchains work together entirely. This Web3 aggregator is stitching networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into one frictionless experience. And it’s not just theory—Qubetics is already deep into its presale with real momentum building. The tech? Game-changing. The price entry? Still early. Let’s break it down. Qubetics Is Solving Blockchain’s Worst Headaches in One Unified System Blockchains are cool—until you try getting them to talk to each other. Right now, a logistics company using Ethereum can’t seamlessly share data with a payment processor running on Solana. A dev building on Avalanche might hit a wall trying to deploy cross-chain smart contracts. And casual users? Forget it. Juggling wallets, interfaces, and swap bridges is enough to push people away. Qubetics solves this nightmare by functioning as a universal Web3 translator. It doesn’t just connect chains—it aggregates them into one smooth ecosystem. This is why Qubetics stands tall among the top cryptos to join for 2025. By eliminating data silos, reducing scalability constraints, and enforcing tight interoperability standards, Qubetics empowers everyone—from NFT artists and DeFi developers to corporate backend engineers—to build, deploy, and operate across multiple blockchains like it’s all one platform. No more friction, no more tech dead-ends. Just clean, user-friendly integration built for how Web3 was always supposed to work. Qubetics Presale: The Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 Are Selling Fast If you’ve been waiting for the right presale to make a move—this is it. The Qubetics presale is now in its 29th stage, and the current price is $0.1573 per $TICS token. With each stage lasting only seven days and ending every Sunday at 12 am sharp, that price rises by 10% like clockwork. Over 507 million $TICS have already been sold, with 24,500+ token holders and a presale tally crossing $15.9 million. That’s not hype—that’s momentum, and it’s building fast ahead of Qubetics’ mainnet launch in Q2 2025. Let’s get real with the numbers. If you get in now and $TICS hits just $1 post-presale, you’re looking at a 535.65% return. At $5? You’re in the 3,078.26% ROI zone. But things get wilder—at $10, that jumps to a jaw-dropping 6,256.47%, and at $15, we’re talking 9,434.71%. For example, a $100 entry right now could earn you $9,540 if $TICS reaches $15. That’s why the Qubetics presale isn’t just another offering—it’s being watched closely by anyone serious about the top cryptos to join for 2025 and looking for that breakout return in the best crypto presale opportunity. Injective’s Major Q1 Upgrades Fall Flat on Price Action Injective has been shipping major tech updates, but the market’s just not responding—yet. In Q1 2025, Injective rolled out native Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support and launched its new Injective AI Index. This index brings together top AI tokens like FET and RNDR along with legacy equity assets like Meta and Nvidia, which is a big step toward integrating traditional markets into DeFi. Still, despite these solid moves, Injective’s price has taken a dive. As of April 8, the coin trades at $7.22, with a 12.64% dip in 24 hours and a full 19.07% drop over the last week. Technical analysis shows bearish pressure isn’t letting up. The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) just crossed below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)—a red flag for momentum. It gets worse: trading volume is shrinking, showing fading interest, and the token now sits in the deep oversold zone. After peaking earlier in the year, Injective’s breakout in January couldn’t hold, and prices have been drifting downward ever since. The protocol’s tech is evolving fast, but the market hasn’t caught up—yet. Aptos Faces Pressure Ahead of $47M Token Unlock Aptos has one of the most anticipated events this week in crypto—and not in the way many hoped. On April 12, it’s scheduled to unlock a whopping $47 million worth of tokens. The problem? That fresh supply could trigger heavy sell-offs from early buyers looking to cash out, potentially driving down the price even further. Token unlocks always shake things up, but when the dollar value is this high, it sends ripples across the market. There’s no sugarcoating it—this kind of unlock could seriously test Aptos’ short-term strength. The community is on edge, watching for signs of a price dip or a mass exodus of liquidity. While Aptos continues to innovate under the hood, the unlock timing has cast a shadow on its momentum. Whether it rebounds post-unlock will depend on how much of that supply actually hits exchanges and how resilient its ecosystem proves under pressure. Why These Coins Matter in the 2025 Crypto Race So what’s the verdict? Injective is dropping major updates but still battling bearish pressure. Aptos has exciting development activity but is caught in the crosshairs of a massive unlock event. Then there’s Qubetics—quietly but powerfully solving blockchain’s biggest usability and interoperability challenges, while building serious traction with a strategic, limited-time presale. If you’re mapping out your next move and eyeing the top cryptos to join for 2025, Qubetics might just be the one project that’s got both the tech and timing in its favor. This could be your best chance to join this best crypto presale before $TICS makes its leap post-mainnet.

43149249,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148003,1744251621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Optimistic Shift: Goldman Sachs Abandons Recession Prediction After Tariff Relief,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/goldman-sachs-recession-tariff-pause/,"In a surprising turn of events, leading investment bank Goldman Sachs has recalibrated its economic outlook, offering a sigh of relief to markets worldwide. Just days after sounding alarms about a potential U.S. recession, the financial giant has withdrawn its forecast. What sparked this dramatic change of heart? It all boils down to a significant pause in tariff implementations by the Trump administration, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X. Let’s dive into the details of this economic U-turn and explore what it means for the US economy and beyond. Why Did Goldman Sachs Initially Predict a Recession? On April 7th, Goldman Sachs raised eyebrows across the financial landscape by increasing its 12-month recession probability for the U.S. economy from 35% to a concerning 45%. This revision reflected growing anxieties about various economic headwinds, including potential impacts from ongoing trade disputes and anticipated tightening of monetary policy. Investors and market analysts closely monitor such forecasts from institutions like Goldman Sachs, as they often influence market sentiment and investment strategies. The initial prediction underscored the fragility of the economic recovery and the potential for unforeseen shocks to derail growth. Here’s a quick look at the timeline: April 7th: Goldman Sachs increases 12-month recession probability to 45%. {{Date of Bloomberg X post}} (Approximate): Trump administration pauses tariff implementation. {{Date of Goldman Sachs withdrawal}} (Approximate): Goldman Sachs withdraws recession forecast. The Game Changer: Tariff Pause and its Economic Implications The central catalyst for Goldman Sachs’ revised outlook is the pause in tariff implementation. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can have a ripple effect across the economy. They can increase costs for businesses, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and reduced corporate profits. In an environment already grappling with inflation concerns, the prospect of new tariffs added another layer of uncertainty and downside risk. By pausing these tariff implementations, the Trump administration has seemingly eased some of the immediate pressures on the US economy, providing a more stable foundation for growth. Consider these potential benefits of a tariff pause: Reduced Inflationary Pressure: Paused tariffs can help prevent further price increases on imported goods, easing inflationary pressures. Business Stability: Companies can operate with more predictability, knowing that input costs are less likely to spike due to new tariffs. Improved Trade Relations: A pause can signal a willingness to negotiate and potentially de-escalate trade tensions, fostering better international economic relationships. What Does This Mean for the US Economy? Goldman Sachs’ withdrawal of its recession call is a significant vote of confidence in the resilience of the US economy . It suggests that while challenges remain, the immediate threat of a sharp economic downturn has diminished. This doesn’t mean the economy is out of the woods entirely, but it does signal a potentially more optimistic trajectory. The pause in tariffs is seen as a crucial factor in mitigating downside risks and supporting continued economic expansion. However, it’s important to remember that economic forecasts are not guarantees, and various factors can still influence the future economic landscape. Key factors influencing the US economy: Factor Potential Impact Inflation High inflation can erode purchasing power and dampen economic growth. Interest Rates Rising interest rates can cool down economic activity and increase borrowing costs. Global Events Geopolitical instability and global economic slowdowns can impact the US economy. Consumer Spending Consumer spending is a major driver of the US economy; changes in consumer behavior can significantly impact growth. Impact on Market Sentiment and Crypto The news from Goldman Sachs is likely to have a positive impact on market sentiment . The removal of a prominent recession forecast can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased investment in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. In the volatile world of crypto, market sentiment plays a crucial role in price movements. Positive news can trigger rallies, while negative news can lead to sell-offs. A more optimistic outlook on the broader economy can create a more favorable environment for crypto adoption and investment. Potential impacts on crypto market sentiment: Increased Investor Confidence: Reduced recession fears can encourage investors to take on more risk, potentially including crypto assets. Positive Price Action: Improved sentiment can lead to increased buying pressure and positive price movements in the crypto market. Broader Market Rally: A general market rally, driven by positive economic news, can often lift the crypto market as well. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do? While Goldman Sachs’ revised forecast is encouraging, it’s crucial for investors to maintain a balanced and informed approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic developments and market analysis from reputable sources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risk, especially in volatile markets. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to short-term market fluctuations. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand your own risk tolerance and invest accordingly. The withdrawal of the recession forecast by Goldman Sachs is a noteworthy development, offering a glimmer of optimism in uncertain times. While economic challenges persist, the pause in tariffs appears to have provided a crucial buffer, altering the near-term outlook. This shift underscores the interconnectedness of global economics and the significant impact of policy decisions on market sentiment. As always, staying informed and maintaining a strategic approach is paramount for navigating the ever-evolving financial landscape.

Crypto transactions would be taxed at 18% with a 5% military levy on top as part of the proposed framework, released on April 8 by Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission. NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Magomedov said in an April 8 statement that “the issue of crypto taxes is not a hypothesis, but a reality that is fast approaching.” He added that the agency created the framework to help lawmakers make an “informed resolution” by considering each suggestion’s advantages and disadvantages because “these aspects can have a critical impact on the market and tax liability.” Under the NSSMC’s proposed crypto framework, a tax will be applied when crypto is cashed out for fiat currency or exchanged for goods or services. Crypto-to-crypto transactions wouldn’t be taxed, bringing Ukraine in line with other European countries, including Austria and France, as well as crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore, the NSSMC said. The regulator says it “makes sense” to exclude stablecoins backed by foreign currencies or only apply a 5% or 9% tax because Ukraine’s tax code already excludes income from transactions in “foreign exchange values.” A translated excerpt of the NSSMC’s report said stablecoins backed by foreign currencies could be exempt from taxation. Source: NSSMC Mining, staking, hard forks and airdrops Other crypto-related activities, such as mining, staking and airdrops, are also addressed in the framework which floated a few options for taxation. The NSSMC said crypto mining is generally considered a business activity, but there might be a general tax-free limit for certain crypto transactions, including mining. Under the framework, staking could be considered as “business captive income” or only taxed if the crypto is cashed out for fiat currencies. While hard forks and airdrops could be taxed either as ordinary income or when the tokens are cashed. Related: Ukraine officials get training on crypto and virtual assets investigation The regulator suggests a tax-free threshold could help “relieve the burden on small investors” and is common in other jurisdictions. Exemptions for donations, transfers between family members, and holders who keep their crypto for a set amount of time are also flagged as possibilities. However, the NSSMC says the exemption might not apply to non-custodial crypto wallets . Last December, Daniil Getmantsev, head of the tax committee of Ukraine’s parliament, said a draft bill to legalize cryptocurrencies was under review and expected to be finalized early this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy first signed a law establishing a legal framework for the country to operate a regulated crypto market in March 2022.

As confirmed by Ripple executives, the SEC has agreed to return $75 million of the $125 million fine Ripple was ordered to pay last year. That would leave Ripple with just a $50 million payment to settle the case. But here’s the catch: the SEC hasn’t officially confirmed anything yet. Big SEC Meeting Set for April 10 The SEC has a closed-door meeting scheduled for Thursday, April 10. This is expected to be very important because Ripple’s deadline to file its response in the appeal process is just days later — on Wednesday, April 16. If the SEC wants to withdraw its appeal about Ripple’s XRP sales, it will likely need to make that decision during this week’s meeting. Otherwise, the case could continue in court. Legal Expert Says Something Is Coming Soon Attorney Fred Rispoli, who has been following the case closely, said that something will happen before or on April 16. He said there’s a 90% chance the case will settle or the appeal will be withdrawn — and only a 10% chance Ripple will actually have to file its legal brief. On SEC v. Ripple, expect to see something happen on or before next Wednesday, 4/16, the due date for @ripple 's appellate brief. Ripple cannot get an extension and either has to file it (10%) or there will be a notice of settlement/withdrawal (90%). https://t.co/j9z0CpTBQo — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) April 9, 2025 When asked if the SEC had already agreed to end the case, Rispoli said the two sides had likely reached an agreement behind the scenes — but the SEC hasn’t made anything public yet, which is standard for them. Why This Matters The appeal is about whether Ripple’s XRP sales on exchanges were illegal. A judge had ruled they were not securities — a major win for Ripple and the crypto industry. If the SEC officially drops its appeal, it would be a big step toward ending the case for good. What’s Next? All eyes are now on the SEC’s April 10 meeting. If the SEC acts, we could see the legal battle finally come to a close by April 16. Until then, Ripple’s fate — and a key moment for crypto regulation — is still in waiting.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-10 02:26:49

The world of trade just took an unexpected turn, and it could ripple through the cryptocurrency landscape. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, known for his assertive trade policies, has announced a temporary tariff freeze . But what’s behind this surprising move, and how might it impact the volatile world of digital assets? Decoding Trump’s Tariff Freeze: A Shock to the System? According to a recent update from Walter Bloomberg, a respected economic news source on X (formerly Twitter), Donald Trump cited ‘fear’ as the primary driver behind this decision. Yes, you read that right – fear. This is quite a shift from his previously stated stance. Let’s break down what we know: The Fear Factor: Trump reportedly stated that ‘people are afraid,’ leading to his approval of a temporary halt on tariff hikes. While the specifics of this fear remain somewhat vague in the initial reports, it suggests concerns about broader economic instability or market jitters. Temporary Relief: This tariff freeze is described as temporary, implying it’s not a permanent policy shift. The duration and exact conditions are still unfolding, leaving room for speculation and market adjustments. Reciprocal Tariffs (Previously): Trump had earlier proposed a 90-day tariff freeze for countries that refrained from retaliating against U.S. tariffs. The condition included a reciprocal tariff rate of 10%. However, China was explicitly excluded from this concession. It’s unclear if the current ‘fear-driven’ freeze follows the same conditions or represents a modified approach. This announcement injects a dose of uncertainty into the already complex global trade environment. But what does this mean for you, the crypto-savvy investor? Market Fear and Crypto: A Tangled Web Market fear is a potent force in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. When fear grips investors, it can trigger sell-offs, volatility spikes, and shifts in investment strategies. Trump’s mention of ‘fear’ as the basis for the tariff freeze is noteworthy. It suggests an acknowledgment of underlying anxieties within the economic system. Here’s how this could connect to the crypto world: Safe Haven Asset? During times of economic uncertainty and market fear , some investors turn to assets perceived as safe havens. Historically, gold has played this role. Increasingly, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being considered as potential digital safe havens, though this narrative is still evolving and debated. Volatility Catalyst: News related to tariffs and trade policies can inject volatility into financial markets. The crypto market, already known for its price swings, could experience amplified volatility in response to these developments. Traders might see opportunities in this increased volatility, while long-term holders may need to brace for potential turbulence. Economic Indicator: Tariff decisions and the underlying ‘fear’ they reflect can be seen as indicators of broader economic health. If market fear is indeed a significant factor influencing policy decisions, it might signal deeper concerns about economic growth, inflation, or geopolitical stability. These macroeconomic factors can indirectly influence investor sentiment towards both traditional and crypto assets. Global Trade Dynamics and Crypto’s Reach Global trade is the lifeblood of the modern economy, and tariffs are a significant tool in shaping trade relationships between nations. Trump’s tariff policies have been a major factor in reshaping global trade flows in recent years. A tariff freeze , even if temporary, can have ripple effects across industries and economies. Here’s the potential link to crypto: Decentralization Appeal: Cryptocurrencies, by their decentralized nature, operate outside the direct control of governments and traditional financial institutions. In a world where global trade is increasingly influenced by geopolitical tensions and policy shifts, the decentralized and borderless nature of crypto could become more appealing to some. Cross-Border Transactions: Cryptocurrencies facilitate cross-border transactions more easily and potentially at lower costs compared to traditional banking systems. In a dynamic global trade environment, this efficiency could be advantageous for businesses engaged in international commerce, especially if traditional trade routes face disruptions. Emerging Markets Focus: Many emerging economies are heavily reliant on global trade . These regions are also witnessing growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. Tariff policies and shifts in global trade dynamics can disproportionately impact emerging markets, potentially influencing the adoption and usage of crypto as alternative financial systems in these areas. Economic Impact : Will the Freeze Thaw Market Concerns? The economic impact of a tariff freeze is multifaceted and depends on various factors, including its duration, scope, and the broader economic context. While a freeze might offer temporary relief, the underlying issues driving market fear may persist. Here’s a look at potential economic impact scenarios and their crypto implications: Scenario Potential Economic Impact Possible Crypto Market Reaction Temporary Relief & Status Quo Short-term market stabilization, reduced immediate trade tensions. Modest positive reaction, potential for sideways trading as markets await further clarity. Sign of Deeper Economic Concerns If the freeze signals broader economic weakness, it could increase investor anxiety. Increased volatility, potential for both upward (safe haven seeking) and downward (risk-off sentiment) pressure on crypto prices. Shift in Trade Policy If the freeze hints at a more lasting change in trade policy, it could reshape global economic relationships. Longer-term implications, potentially influencing capital flows and investor appetite for different asset classes, including crypto. It’s crucial to remember that the economic impact of this tariff freeze is still developing. Market reactions will likely be driven by evolving information, interpretations of Trump’s motives, and broader macroeconomic trends. Navigating the Tariff Terrain: Actionable Insights So, what should crypto investors and enthusiasts make of this tariff freeze ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to trade policy, economic indicators, and market sentiment. Reliable news sources like Walter Bloomberg and reputable financial media outlets are essential. Manage Risk: Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and events like tariff freezes can amplify it. Implement sound risk management strategies, including diversification and position sizing. Consider Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto space. Decentralization, technological innovation, and growing adoption trends remain powerful forces. Analyze Macro Trends: Pay attention to broader macroeconomic trends, including inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth. These factors can indirectly influence crypto market dynamics. Conclusion: A Pause or a Pivot? Trump’s surprising tariff freeze injects a fresh layer of complexity into the global economic narrative. Whether it’s a temporary truce driven by market fear or a sign of a more significant shift in trade policy remains to be seen. For the crypto market, this development underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and the potential for macroeconomic events to create both challenges and opportunities. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and navigate the evolving landscape with a balanced perspective.

43150206,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148023,1744253408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Bitcoin Skeptic Roubini Exposes Fed’s Limits in Trump Trade War,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-intervention-trump-trade-war/,"In a market brimming with anticipation for a Federal Reserve (Fed) bailout at every sign of economic turbulence, a prominent voice of caution has emerged. Nouriel Roubini, the New York University professor and well-known Bitcoin skeptic , has thrown cold water on the widespread expectation that the Fed will swoop in to rescue the markets from the fallout of Trump’s trade war. His recent interview has sent ripples through the financial world, particularly among those invested in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Is the safety net we’ve come to expect truly gone? Let’s dive into Roubini’s stark assessment and what it could mean for your investments. Decoding Roubini’s Warning: Is Fed Intervention Off the Table? Roubini’s core message is blunt: don’t count on the Fed to be your knight in shining armor amidst the escalating trade war impact . He argues that the prevalent belief among traders—that the moment things get shaky, the Fed will step in with monetary easing—might be dangerously misplaced this time. Why this shift in perspective? Several factors are at play: Limited Effectiveness of Rate Cuts: Roubini suggests that the traditional tools of monetary policy, like interest rate cuts, may be less potent in addressing the economic disruptions caused by trade tariffs. Trade wars are supply-side shocks that can lead to stagflation (a combination of inflation and economic stagnation), a scenario where simply lowering interest rates might not be the appropriate or effective solution. Fed’s Hesitation to Intervene Prematurely: He points out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is unlikely to jump into action at the first sign of market jitters. Instead, Powell is expected to adopt a wait-and-see approach, possibly waiting for a clearer signal that Trump is willing to de-escalate his trade actions before considering intervention. This delay could leave markets vulnerable to prolonged periods of uncertainty. Moral Hazard Concerns: Constant Fed intervention to bail out markets can create a ‘moral hazard.’ This means market participants might take on excessive risks, anticipating that the Fed will always be there to cushion any downturn. Roubini’s perspective suggests a potential shift away from this predictable pattern of intervention. In essence, Roubini is challenging the ingrained market reflex of expecting immediate Fed support. He’s urging investors to consider a scenario where the central bank’s response might be delayed or less forceful than in the past, especially when dealing with the complexities of a global trade conflict. The Looming Threat of Trade War Impact on Financial Markets The global trade war impact , primarily initiated by the Trump administration’s tariffs, is not just about import duties and export figures. It’s a multifaceted economic challenge that can trigger a cascade of negative consequences across various sectors and markets. Roubini highlights several key areas of concern: Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, leading to increased costs for businesses. Companies may struggle to find alternative suppliers, leading to production bottlenecks and reduced efficiency. This is particularly relevant in industries with complex international production networks. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, which can translate into higher prices for consumers. While some argue that domestic industries might benefit, the immediate effect can be a rise in inflation, eroding purchasing power and potentially slowing down consumer spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty surrounding trade policies can deter businesses from making long-term investments. Companies may postpone expansion plans, hiring, and capital expenditures until there is more clarity on the trade front. This investment slowdown can dampen economic growth. Global Economic Slowdown: Trade wars can have a contagious effect, impacting not just the countries directly involved but also the global economy as a whole. Reduced trade flows, increased uncertainty, and dampened business sentiment can contribute to a broader economic slowdown, potentially even leading to recessionary pressures. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these broader economic headwinds is crucial. While some view Bitcoin and other digital assets as safe havens during times of economic uncertainty, the reality is far more nuanced. A significant global economic turmoil event can impact all asset classes, including crypto, at least in the short term. Why Bitcoin Skeptic Roubini Doubts Fed Intervention: A Deeper Dive Roubini’s skepticism about the Fed’s willingness or ability to effectively intervene is rooted in his understanding of the current economic and political landscape. Being a known Bitcoin skeptic , his analysis is generally grounded in traditional economic principles, and his views carry weight in mainstream financial circles. Let’s break down his reasoning further: Roubini’s Argument Explanation Trade War is a Supply Shock, Not Just Demand: Traditional monetary policy (rate cuts) is designed to stimulate demand. Trade wars, however, primarily disrupt supply chains and increase costs. Lowering interest rates might not directly address these supply-side issues and could even exacerbate inflationary pressures. Political Constraints on Fed Independence: The Fed is supposed to be politically independent, but in reality, it operates within a political context. Roubini might be suggesting that the Fed could be hesitant to aggressively counter Trump’s trade policies, especially if it’s perceived as directly opposing the administration’s agenda. Limited Policy Space: Interest rates are already relatively low in many developed economies. The Fed has less room to cut rates compared to previous economic downturns. This limited policy space could constrain their ability to effectively respond to a significant economic shock. Risk of Stagflation: As mentioned earlier, trade wars can lead to stagflation. If inflation rises due to tariffs while economic growth slows down, the Fed faces a difficult dilemma. Aggressively easing monetary policy to boost growth could further fuel inflation, while tightening policy to control inflation could worsen the economic slowdown. Roubini’s perspective serves as a stark reminder that the economic challenges posed by trade conflicts are complex and may not be easily resolved by conventional monetary policy tools. His urgent warning encourages a more realistic assessment of the market’s vulnerabilities. Market Instability and the Cryptocurrency Connection The potential for market instability in the wake of trade wars and a potentially less responsive Fed has significant implications for all investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space. While cryptocurrencies are often touted as uncorrelated assets or hedges against traditional market downturns, the reality is more nuanced: Initial Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of heightened market instability , investors tend to move towards cash and perceived safe-haven assets. Initially, this ‘risk-off’ sentiment can negatively impact even cryptocurrencies, as investors reduce exposure to all volatile assets. We witnessed this during the initial market panic of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Longer-Term Inflation Hedge Narrative: If trade wars lead to sustained inflationary pressures, as Roubini suggests is possible, the narrative of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges could gain traction. In this scenario, some investors might turn to crypto as a store of value if they lose confidence in traditional currencies or central bank policies. Correlation with Macroeconomic Events: Cryptocurrency markets, while still relatively nascent, are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic events and global economic sentiment. Significant economic turmoil , such as a global recession triggered or exacerbated by trade wars, could have complex and unpredictable effects on crypto prices. It’s not guaranteed that crypto will act as a safe haven in all scenarios. Regulatory Responses: Economic instability can also prompt regulatory responses from governments and financial authorities. In times of crisis, regulators might become more inclined to tighten control over emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies, which could introduce new challenges and uncertainties for the crypto market. Therefore, while the cryptocurrency market might present unique opportunities, it is not immune to broader economic risks. Understanding the potential for market instability and the complex interplay between macroeconomics and crypto is crucial for informed investment decisions. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights in Times of Economic Turmoil Roubini’s analysis paints a picture of potential economic turmoil and increased market volatility. So, what actionable insights can investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, take away? Diversification is Key: In uncertain times, diversification across asset classes is more important than ever. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto, stocks, bonds, or any other single asset class. A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. Stress-Test Your Portfolio: Consider how your portfolio would perform under different economic scenarios, including a prolonged trade war, market instability , and potential economic turmoil . Understanding your portfolio’s vulnerabilities can help you make informed adjustments. Stay Informed and Agile: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, trade policy announcements, and central bank communications. Be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as the situation evolves. Agility and adaptability are crucial in volatile markets. Manage Risk Prudently: Avoid excessive leverage and risky bets, especially in highly uncertain environments. Focus on risk management and capital preservation. This is particularly relevant in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Consider Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is likely, try to maintain a long-term perspective. Major economic shifts often create opportunities for patient investors who can weather the storm and position themselves for future growth. Roubini’s urgent warning is not necessarily a prediction of doom, but rather a call for realism and preparedness. By acknowledging the potential limitations of Fed intervention and understanding the multifaceted risks of trade wars, investors can navigate the current economic landscape with greater awareness and resilience. In conclusion, Nouriel Roubini’s perspective serves as a crucial counterpoint to the prevailing market optimism regarding Fed intervention. His analysis highlights the potential for prolonged market instability and economic turmoil stemming from trade wars, urging investors to reassess their expectations and strategies. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this means acknowledging that while crypto may offer unique opportunities, it is not immune to broader macroeconomic headwinds. A prudent and diversified approach, coupled with a keen awareness of global economic trends, is paramount in these uncertain times. The era of relying solely on a Fed ‘put’ may be waning, and a new era of market vigilance and strategic adaptation may be upon us.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just given the green light to options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs . This monumental decision marks a significant expansion in the world of ETH-based financial products, offering investors a wider array of tools to engage with the second-largest cryptocurrency. But what exactly does this mean for you, and how will it reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency options trading? Unlocking New Opportunities with Spot Ethereum ETFs Options For quite some time, the crypto community has eagerly awaited the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs . With the SEC’s prior approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the expectation for Ethereum followed suit, and now it’s a reality! This latest development, as reported by Unfolded on X, takes things a step further by enabling options trading on these newly approved ETFs. But why is this such a big deal? Enhanced Investment Strategies: Options provide sophisticated investors with tools beyond simply buying and holding. With cryptocurrency options on spot Ethereum ETFs , investors can now implement strategies like covered calls, protective puts, straddles, and strangles to manage risk, generate income, or speculate on ETH’s price movements with greater precision. Increased Market Liquidity: The introduction of options typically brings more liquidity to the underlying asset. As market makers and traders engage in options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs , it can lead to tighter bid-ask spreads and more efficient price discovery for ETH itself. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: Options are a staple in traditional finance. The availability of cryptocurrency options on regulated spot Ethereum ETFs may further encourage institutional investors who are familiar with options strategies to enter the Ethereum market. This could lead to a significant influx of capital. Accessibility for Retail Investors: While options trading can be complex, the approval of options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs eventually makes these strategies more accessible to retail investors through brokerage platforms that offer ETF trading. Decoding SEC Approval for Ethereum ETF Options The SEC’s approval process for crypto-related financial products has been closely watched and often scrutinized. The fact that they have now approved options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs signals a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto within the traditional financial framework. Let’s break down what this SEC approval really entails: Aspect Details Regulatory Oversight SEC approval means that the exchanges listing these options trading contracts will be subject to regulatory oversight, providing a degree of investor protection and market integrity. Listing Exchanges While the SEC has approved the *concept* of options on spot Ethereum ETFs , individual exchanges still need to file and receive approval to list specific options trading products. Expect announcements from exchanges in the coming weeks and months. Product Complexity Options trading involves derivatives, which are inherently more complex than simply buying and selling the underlying asset (ETH or spot Ethereum ETFs ). Investors need to understand the risks involved, including time decay, volatility, and leverage. Market Maturity This SEC approval is a sign of increasing maturity in the cryptocurrency market. It demonstrates a move towards more sophisticated financial products and a deeper integration with traditional finance. Navigating the Landscape of Cryptocurrency Options Trading on ETH ETFs With the doors now open for options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs , it’s crucial to understand how to navigate this evolving landscape. Here are some key considerations and actionable insights: Education is Key: Before diving into cryptocurrency options , especially on spot Ethereum ETFs , ensure you have a solid understanding of options terminology, strategies, and risk management. Numerous online resources and educational platforms can help. Start Small: If you’re new to options, begin with small positions and gradually increase your trading size as you gain experience and confidence. Choose Reputable Platforms: Select regulated and reputable exchanges or brokerage platforms that will offer options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs once they become available. Look for platforms with robust security measures and clear fee structures. Risk Management is Paramount: Always employ sound risk management techniques when trading cryptocurrency options . This includes setting stop-loss orders, understanding position sizing, and never risking more capital than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and exchange announcements related to options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs . The Future is Bright for Ethereum and Options The SEC approval of options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs is a watershed moment for the crypto industry, particularly for Ethereum. It signifies a significant step forward in legitimizing and integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. While challenges and complexities remain, the availability of cryptocurrency options on spot Ethereum ETFs promises to unlock new opportunities for investors, enhance market efficiency, and potentially drive further institutional adoption of Ethereum. This development is poised to inject a new wave of excitement and sophistication into the world of crypto investing.

It includes presales like ‘FloppyPepe,’ which have generated a lot of interest and are projected to rise meteorically. Meanwhile, the industry stalwarts, Bitcoin (BTC, 80,114.36) and Binance Coin (BNB, $560.86), exhibit stability and robust ecosystem dynamics. One must comprehend these options within the context of the evolving paradigm in order to navigate the futuristic digital landscape. FloppyPepe ($FPPE): AI Ecosystem Explosive Presale Opportunities The use of AI to facilitate engagement within a community digital ecosystem fully empowers users and allows for value creation beyond speculation, which is what sets FloppyPepe ($FPPE) apart. It intends to incorporate AI tools (FloppyAI chatbot, FloppyX video framework), community aspects (a content creation tool, Meme DAO governance), and purposeful tokenomics through a 3% transaction fee structure (charity funding, holder rewards, and token burns). This extensive framework targeting the 120 trillion token supply seeks to cultivate active users and long-term relevance. Primary interest stems from the presale stage at this point. Offering 60% of tokens for early participation and setting ambitious funding targets of $20M and $45M caps, the returns are expected to be mind-blowing. Seeing as the current price is extraordinarily low at $0.0000002, a speculative target of $0.01 would suggest a staggering 4,999,900% ROI. In other words, a $100 investment would theoretically turn into $5 million dollars, a sharp example of the high-risk, high-reward scenario that the FloppyPepe presale focuses on for those wanting exponential returns. Binance Coin (BNB): Ecosystem Dominance BNB’s value, which anchors the Binance ecosystem and trades strongly at the price of $560.86, receives constant development and further utility through fee payment mechanisms. The launchpad has been a major fee-generation utility. Both developments are supportive of HODLer Airdrops (recently featuring Particle Network); rewards demonstrate commitment that strengthens user esteem and shifts BNB into the category of blue-chip crypto assets. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Benchmark Bitcoin , the first ever introduced cryptocurrency, remains a market leader and benchmark, stabilizing around $80,114.36. Arguably, the Turkish tariff announcement was the most recent shock placed on the market, but in the middle of all this turbulence, BTC remained remarkably stable, supporting the narrative for some investors of it functioning as a digital gold store of value. Bitcoin keeps being relevant in any crypto discussion. Weighing Trending Crypto Opportunities Looking at 2025, the heavily marketed cryptos are always compared to leading ones in terms of value against untapped possibilities. For mainstream trusted options like Bitcoin, there are services like FloppyPepe ($FPPE) taking creative approaches to the presale, pricing out the market in hopes of life-changing ROI figures. The risk the FloppyPepes presale offers for higher demand in exponential growth makes for a compelling story, as opposed to the reasons for BTC and BNB’s predictability.

China announced an increase in tariffs on US goods to 84%, which is to take effect on April 10. This represents a direct response to President Donald Trump’s earlier imposition of a 104% tariff on Chinese imports. These tit-for-tat measures have intensified the ongoing trade war between the two largest global economies. How Did Markets React to Conflicting News? Interestingly, while specific US-China tensions worsened, broader financial markets, including crypto, showed slight recovery in the last 24 hours. The rally was in response to news reports from the White House announcing a 90-day pause on other planned US tariff hikes (not related to the active China tariffs).

Several Wednesday filings show investors can now trade options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Mini Trust. Options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, ETH in this case, at a predetermined price within a set date. James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that the approval was “100% expected,” and the Commission had until April 9 to decide on the approval. Good news.

Covered call strategy eth ETFs, buffer eth ETFs, etc. https://t.co/Ndqz4cEBQ2 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 9, 2025 SEC’s Delayed Decision Over Ether ETF Options The US financial watchdog’s approval of ETHA options on Wednesday, comes after the agency initially postponed its decision on allowing options. Nasdaq ISE filed for the options on July 22, 2024. Following Nasdaq’s filing on BlackRock’s behalf, a letter from Better Markets, warned the SEC to be careful before allowing options trading for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, citing their high volatility. Last October, the SEC approved options trading on 11 Bitcoin ETFs for NYSE American, Nasdaq, and Cboe Exchange. The recent approvals offer a hedging vehicle for investors to meet their needs in connection with Ether-related products and positions, the Commission’s approval note read. “The Exchange believes that offering options on Ether Funds will benefit investors by providing them with an additional, relatively lower-cost investing tool to gain exposure to the price of Ether.” ETH Price Soars Over 14% on ETFs and Trump’s Tariff Pause Following the SEC’s options approval on the ETH ETFs and the recent 90-day Trump tariff pause , Ethereum price spiked 14% in the past 24 hours. Coinmarketplace data shows that Ethereum is now trading for $1,641 at press time. Per Farside Investors data , the SEC’s approval comes at a time when ETH ETF holders are seeing increased losses. The funds were down over 50% YTD, and the trend has affected ETH ETF flows, which saw only four days of inflows since February 20. On the other hand, two -2x ETH ETFs are the best-performing ETFs so far in 2025, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted. These products represent a 2x leverage short positioning on ETH ETFs. The best performing ETF this year is the -2x Ether ETF $ETHD , up 247%. #2 is the other -2x Ether ETF. I was sure it would be $UVIX (2x VIX), but that's #3.

43150958,https://coinpedia.org/?p=442186,1744254771,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,21 Shares Officially Files For DOGE ETF; Dogecoin Price Soars,https://coinpedia.org/news/21-shares-officially-files-for-doge-etf/,"The post 21 Shares Officially Files For DOGE ETF; Dogecoin Price Soars appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News 21Shares has officially filed to launch a Dogecoin ETF in the U.S., aiming to bring the popular meme coin to Wall Street. The company submitted an S-1 registration form with the SEC and is also awaiting its approval of a 19-b4 filing, both of which are needed before its trading can begin. Notably, the 21 Shares Dogecoin ETF will track the price of DOGE using the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, giving investors a simple and regulated way to gain exposure to the memecoin without directly needing to hold the asset. 21Shares Joins Grayscale and Bitwise This move comes as Dogecoin bounces back from a sharp sell-off which led to a drop in its price to $0.14. 21Shares becomes the third firm to file for the Dogecoin ETF after Grayscale and Bitwise. The next step is to file a 19b-4 for the fund which will formally begin the approval process with the SEC. Notably, this move comes on the same day as 21Shares launched a Dogecoin ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange, in an ‘exclusive partnership’ with the House of Doge. This ETP is notably the first and only one endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. If the SEC approves the ETF, 21Shares and the House of Doge will collaborate again to promote the fund. Coinbase will serve as the custodian for the fund. This development serves as a bullish outlook for the memecoin which could boost its adotion and drive a surge in its price. Crypto Market Rallies After Trump’s Unexpected Pause Crypto analyst Kevin Capital pointed out a bullish pattern on DOGE’s chart that could signal a potential rebound. While the recent rally may be tied to macro news, specifically Trump’s decision to pause tariffs for 90 days, Kevin noted that the charts had already been hinting at this move. The crypto market saw a rebound after Trump’s announcement with Bitcoin juming to as much as 7.7% to $82,967. While Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP all surged by more than 12%, Solana shot up by an impressive 14%. Paul Atkins Now Confirmed Earlier this year, the firm also filed with the SEC to launch spot ETFs for Polkadot (DOT) and XRP. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart notes that the surge in crypto ETF filings is like a “spaghetti cannon” with companies trying all kinds of ideas to see what the new SEC leadership might approve. The Bloomberg analysts believe there’s a 75% chance that a Dogecoin ETF will get approved this year.

The surge appears to validate BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s Monday prediction that the looming economic uncertainty could create an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Trump Tariff U-Turn Ignites $84K Bitcoin Price Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) entered a 12% rebound on Thursday, was triggered by Trump’s abrupt reversal on sweeping tariffs initially aimed at all U.S. trading partners. The revised trade policy, which now targets a flat 10% tariff (excluding China), eased investor fears of an escalating global trade war. Bitcoin price action, April 10 2025 The crypto market responded swiftly. BTC price soared from an intraday low of $74,700 to peak near $83,600, its strongest single-day move since March. Top altcoins followed in Bitcoin bullish lockstep, with Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Solana and Dogecoin also pulled double-digit gains. Markets Reaction Aligns with Blackrock CEO’s prediction Bitcoin 10% price rebound on Thursday coincided with remarks made earlier in the week by Larry Fink at the Economic Club of New York. When asked about Trump’s tarrifs, warned that broad tariffs could trigger a 20% correction in global markets, but added that such a move would likely present an “incredible buying opportunity.” “I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity,” Blackrock CEO, Larry Fink said, emphasising a positive near-term outlook. With Trump’s early tariff U-turn appears to affirm the Blackrock CEO’s prediction that the trade war turbulence over the past, provides a opportunity for savvy traders to buy the dip. negate one of the key bearish risks, market participants seemed to interpret the event as a green light for reentry—validating Fink’s foresight. Binance sees $1.3B exchange deposits amid two-week turbulence Bitcoin price has endured intense volatility over the past week, as Trump tariffs sparked bearish pressure. However, on-chain data trends suggests that the intra-day see-saw price movements may not be over yet. Bitcoin Exchange Deposits vs. BTC price | Source: CryptoQuant According to CryptoQuant data, total Bitcoin deposits on Binance increased by over significantly since the market turbulence began. As seen above, between March 28 and April 10, Binance BTC deposits rose from 2,419,603 BTC to 2,435,662 BTC. Valued at the current BTC prices around $83,500, it means that investors have deposited 16,059 BTC worth $1,340,926,500 over the last two weeks, i When exchange deposits surge, flashes bearish signals, inflating short-term supply and amplifying volatility. First it hints a broad market anxiety, as investors shift tokens into exchange to enable rapid trade reactions to volatile news signals or seek short-term opportunities to reduce exposure if market sentiment worsens. Until Binance begins to see rapid exchange withdrawals indicating transfers into long-term savings, the elevated BTC deposits in Binance-hosted trading wallets suggest majority of active investors remain primed to react to short-term triggers. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Faces Key Resistance at $88.8K as Traders Eye $100K Milestone Despite the bullish momentum, Bitcoin faces a formidable technical barrier at $88,800—the high from April 2 when the initial tariff news broke. The Keltner channel upper limit on the BTCUSD 12-hour chart currently hovers around $88,130, reinforcing this as a critical resistance zone. This aligns with the recent local top recorded last Wednesday, just before Trump announced the initial sweeping tariffs. Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSD Given the speed of the rebound, traders who entered at the start of the correction may look to take profits near breakeven levels, creating a sell-wall scenario. Unless BTC breaks through this choke point with strong volume, the path to $100,000 may remain elusive in the near term. Markets are also in a holding pattern as inflation data from both the U.S. and China is set to be released Thursday. A dovish reading could provide the final confirmation for Fink’s thesis and reinvigorate bulls. Bearish Breakdown Could Target $73.5K if Inflation Prints Disappoint While sentiment has turned cautiously optimistic, the risk of retracement looms large if inflation figures exceed expectations. Hawkish surprises could shift monetary policy outlooks, prompting a market-wide pivot toward risk-off assets. The lower Keltner Channel band—currently around $73,500—marks a strong support area and aligns with a liquidity cluster from last week’s consolidation. A breach below $80,000, particularly on heightened selling volume, could accelerate downside momentum. Moreover, the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) remains negative at -1,888, suggesting the rally has yet to establish firm footing in terms of sustainable trend momentum. Conclusion While the short-term outlook has improved, BTC must overcome the $88,800 resistance to turn $100K from hopeful projection into actionable reality. If inflation data cooperates and investor sentiment remains bullish, the breakout could continue. But a failure to hold the $80,000 level might open the door for a retracement to $73,500, especially if macro headwinds return.

Following the confirmation, Atkins has been cleared to lead a regulatory agency currently undergoing major policy changes, according to Reuters . Atkins, a seasoned SEC veteran and outspoken advocate for the crypto industry, was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed Gary Gensler, who resigned in January following years of conflict with digital asset firms. Atkins served as a SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. Since then, he has led a regulatory consulting firm and advised several financial and crypto startups. He has also co-chaired the Token Alliance, a group promoting blockchain innovation, and even testified in court as an expert witness defending firms sued by the Gensler-led SEC. Ethics filings show that Atkins and his wife hold between $327 million and $588.8 million in total assets, with about $6 million tied to digital assets. Until recently, he held equity and options in Anchorage Digital and Securitize, two major crypto firms, and a $5 million limited partner stake in the crypto investment fund Off the Chain Capital. Now that he is confirmed, he has agreed to divest from all crypto holdings. You might also like: Uniswap, Coinbase, and NYSE execs to join SEC roundtable on crypto trading regulations During his Mar. 27 pre-confirmation hearing, Atkins promised to introduce clear rules for digital assets and reduce political interference in regulatory decisions. He criticized past SEC policies under Gensler as vague and overly aggressive, arguing that they slowed innovation and hurt capital formation. “It’s time to return common sense to the SEC,” he told the Senate panel. The appointment was not without controversy. Senator Elizabeth Warren led the Democratic opposition, citing Atkins’ close ties to the financial industry and his role during the 2008 financial crisis. She warned that putting him in charge of the SEC could weaken investor protections and give too much power to crypto lobbyists. Industry insiders expect Atkins to shift the agency’s focus away from enforcement and toward creating a more supportive environment for crypto innovation. His confirmation comes after acting chair Mark Uyeda and commissioner Hester Peirce recently scaled back the number of lawsuits against crypto companies and reviewed the agency’s approach to digital assets. Atkins’ appointment aligns with the Trump administration’s effort to make the U.S. a global hub for digital assets. With Atkins set to take office soon, many in the industry view this as a sign that blockchain-based financial products will be adopted more widely and that exchange-traded funds approvals will proceed more quickly.

According to an Apr. 9 press release statement , the acquisition marks a huge step for Magic Eden into broader on-chain trading, as interest in non-fungible tokens continues to decline. Slingshot’s technology simplifies cross-chain trading in decentralized finance. Today, users often need to bridge assets, manage multiple wallets, and hold different gas tokens to transact across blockchains. Slingshot streamlines this process with a “ chain abstracted ” experience, enabling users to place spot or limit orders for any token using one non-custodial balance, without worrying about gas or bridges. Magic Eden’s chief executive officer Jack Lu called the acquisition a “major step forward,” saying it aligns with the company’s vision to make trading seamless and accessible. “Pairing Slingshot’s team of product visionaries with Magic Eden’s best-in-class marketing and scaling capabilities accelerates our ability to have an impact on the future of crypto.” — Jack Lu, Magic Eden CEO You might also like: Court approves $11m settlement in Shaquille O’Neal’s Astrals NFT lawsuit Slingshot will continue to operate as an independent platform.

The app won’t launch a token for now, though Magic Eden is exploring ways to bring incentives like referrals and possible ME token integration in the future. The acquisition’s timing is notable. According to DappRadar’s Q1 2025 report , NFT trading volume dropped to $1.5 billion, a 24% decrease from Q4 2024. Sales count fell by 10%, reflecting a slowdown in high-value trades. The global NFT market cap now stands at $3.01 billion, with CryptoPunks alone accounting for 23% of that. In the past 24 hours, the total NFT trading volume was just $4.9 million, as per CoinGecko data . Through Slingshot’s acquisition, Magic Eden seems to be adjusting to this shift, betting on token trading to maintain its dominance . By providing improved discovery tools, fiat onramps like Apple Pay and Venmo, and universal trading balances, the two teams hope to compete with centralized exchanges.

After falling below $80,000 on Sunday, the digital asset has struggled to reclaim upward momentum, reflecting persistent selling pressure in the broader crypto market. While price action continues to dominate headlines, on-chain data reveals deeper shifts in market dynamics. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Onchained highlights a notable transition in Bitcoin ownership patterns. Related Reading: Next Bitcoin Peak Delayed To Late 2026, Business Cycle Expert Warns Bitcoin Short-Term Losses and Long-Term Accumulation In the post titled “Short-Term Capitulation Meets Long-Term Conviction: A Structural Shift in Bitcoin Ownership,” the analyst identified structural changes between short-term and long-term holders, providing insights into the asset’s underlying market behavior. According to the insight, Bitcoin has seen a ~15% drawdown from $88,000 to $74,400 over the past week. On April 7, Short-Term Holders (STH) realized a significant $10 billion drop in their realized cap—a metric reflecting the price at which coins were last moved—marking their largest single-day loss of the cycle. This decline was met with an almost equivalent $9.7 billion increase in Long-Term Holders’ (LTH) realized cap, suggesting a substantial transfer of coins from recent buyers to more experienced holders. By April 8, realized losses from STHs declined to $693 million, indicating a possible exhaustion of panic selling. In contrast, LTHs continued increasing their cost basis by an additional $1.13 billion, reflecting ongoing accumulation despite minimal price recovery. Onchained interprets this as a typical sign of supply transitioning from weaker hands to those with higher conviction, which has historically occurred near market bottoms or early recovery stages. The analyst noted: “This is not merely a coincidence: this is the market transferring coins from weak to strong hands.” Adding: Long-term investors are stepping in with conviction: buying weakness and absorbing supply. – This behavior has historically marked the late stages of corrections or the early phase of recovery. Potential Impact on Market Structure This divergence between STH and LTH behavior may hold broader implications for Bitcoin’s market structure. As STHs reduce their holdings, potential short-term sell pressure and overhead resistance may decline. At the same time, rising accumulation by LTHs suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, even amid current volatility. Historically, similar patterns have preceded stabilization or trend reversals. A shrinking supply in the hands of reactive traders coupled with consistent buying by long-term participants can form the foundation for renewed price support. Whether this shift signals the end of the current correction or an early stage of recovery remains to be confirmed, but on-chain trends continue to suggest meaningful repositioning within the Bitcoin market.

However, another analyst argued that while it could signal an impending sell-off, it might also indicate a bullish trend. Investors are “actively moving funds to Binance” CryptoQuant contributor Maarten Regterschot said in an April 9 post that Binance’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve increased by 22,106 BTC, worth $1.82 billion, over the last 12 days to a total of 590,874 BTC. “This shows a strong acceleration in BTC inflows to Binance. It’s likely that investors are actively moving funds to Binance due to the macro uncertainty and before the upcoming CPI announcement,” Regterschot said. CoinMarketCap shows Bitcoin is trading at $82,474 at the time of publication, up 8.8% in the past day after receiving a boost from Trump’s 90-day tariff pause on all countries but China. Binance’s Bitcoin Reserve has 590,874 Bitcoin. Source: CryptoQuant The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to deliver the CPI results for March on April 10. During uncertain times, traders often move their crypto onto exchanges to sell, leading to more volatility as confidence starts to decline. However, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that this isn’t always a bearish signal. “Large inflows could be a sign of selling, but it is a very fluid market. It is plausible that Binance is shifting assets into its hot wallets to meet heavy demand.” “The next few days are critical in understanding the appetite of the market for crypto after Trump’s climbdown on tariffs,” he said. Earlier on April 9, Trump issued a 90-day pause on his administration’s “reciprocal tariffs,” lowering the tariff rate to 10% on all countries besides China, which he ramped up to 125%, citing the country’s counter-tariffs against the US. “Tensions between the US and China remain a structural overhang,” Hundal said. Related: Bitcoin price at risk of new 5-month low near $71K if tariff war and stock market tumult continues Meanwhile, crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said that the March CPI results “will show inflation is crashing down probably close to 2.5%.” “Another interesting day coming,” he added. Crypto analyst Dyme said , “Lower than expected CPI print will send us higher.” However, FactSet’s consensus estimates show economists expect consumer prices to have risen by 0.1% month-over-month in March. On March 12, the CPI came in lower than expected at 3.1% , beating expectations of 3.2%, with a corresponding 0.1% drop in headline inflation figures.

The vote saw 128 in favor, 93 against, and seven abstentions. Libra Meme Coin Scandal According to the report , the committee will have the authority to summon top government officials and demand documentation from public institutions. Key figures expected to testify include Economy Minister Luis Caputo, Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, and Chief of Staff Guillermo Francos. However, there has been criticism regarding the exclusion of President Milei and his sister Karina from the inquiry. Lawmaker Sabrina Selva, in particular, argued that both should be compelled to clarify their involvement in the LIBRA incident. The investigation follows accusations that Milei used his influence to promote the LIBRA meme coin. The token had surged in value to $5 and even briefly reached a market capitalization of $4 billion after President Milei shared details about the token on X. The value, however, collapsed by over 94% once he deleted the post, which sparked suspicions of a pump-and-dump scheme. In response, lawyers Marcos Zelaya and Jonatan Baldiviezo, joined by engineer María Eva Koutsovitis and economist Claudio Lozano, filed a formal criminal complaint on February 17, wherein the individuals accused Milei of fraud for his role in promoting the cryptocurrency. Several critics have also alleged that the project was a “rug-pull” scam, and Milei was accused of misleading investors by using his considerable social media following of 3.8 million. Findings Related to LIBRA On-chain analytics platform Nansen’s report found that 86% of traders who purchased the meme coin lost an estimated $251 million. Only a handful of fortunate investors walked away with profits of more than $180 million. Subsequent investigation by blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps linked LIBRA’s creators to previous pump-and-dump operations and even showed evidence of profits funneled through various wallets, including one connected to MELANIA token creators. Despite this, LIBRA creator Hayden Davis dismissed criticism, claimed that those upset missed out on opportunities, and defended meme coin dynamics.

The move comes days after appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as strategic crypto advisor. Bilal Bin Saqib, the Council’s head and advisor to the finance minister said that the country has been in talks with several Bitcoin mining firms. The location of the Bitcoin mining centre will depend on the availability of surplus power in some regions, he added. “Pakistan is in the top 10 global crypto adopters despite it not being regularised,” Saqib told Reuters , adding that the country has 15-20 million crypto users. Saqib noted that the country aims to foster fintech innovation and growth through regulatory sandboxes, and safe environments for testing. Further, he said that crypto, blockchain and AI upskilling among the country’s youths would foster job creation and economy. This would boost “exports through digital services, positioning the country as a hub for emerging tech talent on the global stage,” he added. Pakistan is consulting with global regulators to build a “Pakistan-first” crypto framework, Crypto Council CEO @Bilalbinsaqib told Cryptonews. #Pakistan #CryptoCouncil https://t.co/GZ9vkwUTo5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 1, 2025 Pakistan’s Challenging Energy Sector The South Asian nation has seen structural challenges in its energy sector over the past years, from high electricity tariffs and chronic overcapacity. Per a 2021 report , Pakistan reportedly generated more electrical capacity than needed. “We are producing much more than we need,” Tabish Gauhar, a special assistant to the prime minister on power, told Reuter at the time. The surplus energy came after the construction of new power plants, largely coal-fired ones funded by China. Per estimates from Ember Energy , Pakistan generates 59% share of electricity from fossil fuels and 41% share of electricity from clean sources, which is above the global average of 39%. Further, the country generates 3% electricity from solar and wind. Global Bitcoin Mining Firms Explore Country’s Potential In a March 25 interview with Bloomberg , Saqib noted that Pakistan is eyeing on global Bitcoin mining firms to utilize its electricity potential. “We welcome companies to visit Pakistan to evaluate for Bitcoin mining,” he said, adding that this is the right time to explore mining options. He also praised the US President Trump, calling him the “biggest, bullish catalyst for crypto in history.” “I think the US sets the tone for the world. Trump is making crypto a national priority and every country including Pakistan will have to follow suit or will be at the risk of being left behind.” The post Pakistan Plans to Utilize Part of Surplus Electricity for Bitcoin Mining: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Mining|Pakistan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|BNB,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-10 03:49:13

The move has injected fresh optimism into markets that have been weighed down by ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty. This development could be the market catalyst many investors were waiting for, potentially signaling the start of a bull run across both traditional and digital assets. Relief Rally: Stocks and Crypto Turn Green Immediately following the tariff pause announcement, U.S. stock indexes rallied sharply. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones all posted significant gains, breaking out of oversold territory with strong green candles on the daily charts. Even gold joined the rally, signaling broader investor relief. In the crypto space, Bitcoin (BTC) surged back above $82,000, marking an 8.87% gain in 24 hours. The move triggered a wave of short liquidations—over $75 million worth—fueling a further price jump. The global crypto market cap now stands at $2.59 trillion, up 8.40% on the day. What’s Next? The 90-day tariff pause runs through the end of June, potentially aligning with historical seasonality in crypto where Q2 often delivers strong gains. April, May, and June have traditionally been favorable months for Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin’s recent performance, especially compared to previous market crashes, has impressed even traditional analysts. Bernstein recently described the current 26% dip as “mild,” especially considering past corrections have reached 50-70%. Many believe this showcases BTC’s growing maturity and institutional support.

In an April 9 letter to New York federal court judge Eric Komitee, Karony’s attorney, Nicholas Smith, said the court should consider an April 7 memo from US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that disbanded the DOJ’s crypto unit . “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” Blanche said in the memo, which added the DOJ “will no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that have the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets.” Blanche also directed prosecutors not to charge violations of securities and commodities laws when the case would require the DOJ to determine if a digital asset is a security or commodity when charges such as wire fraud are available. An excerpt of the letter Karony sent to Judge Komitee. Source: PACER In the footnote of the letter, Karony’s counsel wrote an exemption to the DOJ’s new directive would be if the parties have an interest in defending that a crypto asset is a security, but added that “Karony does not have such an interest.” The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed simultaneous charges of securities violations, wire fraud, and money laundering against Karony and other SafeMoon executives in November 2023. The government alleged Karony, SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and chief technology officer Thomas Smith withdrew assets worth $200 million from the project and misappropriated investor funds. Another attempt to nix the case The letter is Karony’s latest attempt to get the case thrown out. In February, he asked that his trial , scheduled to begin on March 31, be delayed as he argued President Donald Trump’s proposed crypto policies could potentially affect the case. Related: OKX pleads guilty, pays $505M to settle DOJ charges Later in February, Smith changed his plea to guilty and said he took part in the alleged $200 million crypto fraud scheme. Nagy is at large and is believed to be in Russia. SafeMoon filed for bankruptcy in December 2023, a month after it was hit with twin cases from the SEC and DOJ. It was also hacked in March 2023, with the hacker agreeing to return 80% of the funds.

The airdrop will benefit holders of $WLFI tokens, as Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) moves ahead in rolling out its stablecoin, USD1, on Binance’s blockchain. This signs a major step for the stablecoin ecosystem and illuminates some of the not-too-distant future of institutional adoption in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. We just posted a new governance proposal: To test our airdrop functionality by distributing USD1 to all $WLFI holders — rewarding our earliest supporters and preparing for future growth. Join the discussion https://t.co/NDg5yMYUrM — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) April 7, 2025 A Key Moment for USD1 and the WLFI Community Trump’s World Liberty Financial has now deployed its stablecoin, USD1, on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), aimed at the niche community of very early adopters that hold $WLFI tokens. As part of this deployment, WLFI has recently conducted a trial airdrop of its token that is designed to reward not just any holder of $WLFI, but especially those that invested in the $WLFI presale, while at the same time testing the airdrop mechanism ahead of a much more scaled operation in the future. The intent here is very much not to just get some tokens into some hands, but to get some USD1 into the hands of real users, who can effect the sort of real market demand that will give this thing the kind of future it needs to be effective. BREAKING: @cz_binance just reposted the announcement about the $USD1 airdrop on BNB Chain for all $WLFI holders. Trump’s World Liberty Financial has deployed its stablecoin #USD1 on Binance’s blockchain — and now they’re proposing an airdrop to reward the WLFI community. #BSC … https://t.co/1EWmXUuBKI pic.twitter.com/OYAabyENBG — Notaz.Sol (@CryptoNotaz) April 8, 2025 The airdrop’s goal is to give first users a chance to get the USD1 stablecoin, which is intended for mainly institutional and sovereign users, and which is aimed at an even more secure and stable version of the already ultra-secure and stable stablecoin family. For the record, as I understand it, the way stablecoins work is that for every stablecoin that exists, there’s an equivalent amount of currency held either in a bank or something equally safe, and that currency is marked such that it can’t be spent. This is to ensure that stablecoin holders can use them safe in the knowledge that, for instance, when they use a USD1 to pay for something that isn’t a stablecoin, what they’re using isn’t some fake version of a USD1. It’s the real deal. A main point that has grabbed attention is that this airdrop will occur on the Ethereum blockchain to start, with subsequent distributions and cross-chain transfers planned. The stablecoin, USD1, is already compatible with both the Ethereum and BNB Chain ecosystems, and successful testing of token transfers between the two blockchains has been completed, with Wintermute, a key partner in the project, assisting. Key Airdrop Details: What to Expect While the firm has not fully divulged the specific sums involved for the USD1 airdrop, it has suggested that each qualifying wallet will receive a set amount. This is a purposeful move that aims to level up the distribution of funds among holders of $WLFI tokens. The airdrop’s eligibility criteria are tethered tightly to the tokens’ ownership, so the distribution should benefit participants in the presale phase of the token’s launch more than it should benefit the average Joe. While the exact day when the airdrop will happen is still up for debate, WLFI has assured us that this is all part of the live technical test. Moreover, the last details of the airdrop will be determined by community governance. WLFI holders will have a say in the final decision of when and an airdrop will happen and the specifics of how it will be executed. Voting on these decisions is still taking place, but the direction seems clear. With total amount of yes’s getting to an overwhelming amount, even as airdrop hater myself, I can’t help but think that the final destination of this vote is as clear as the number 16. In addition, the process for the final details of the airdrop will be determined through community governance. This governance structure, which is driven by the community, ensures that decisions regarding the project’s evolution are made in a transparent and inclusive manner. It empowers the WLFI community to have a direct say in the future of USD1 and its broader use case. The Bigger Picture: USD1 and Its Future Potential The USD1 stablecoin is a major player in the fast-growing stablecoin market. While most other stablecoins target retail users, USD1 is purpose-built for institutional and sovereign adoption. The backing by U.S. Treasuries and custody of the coin with BitGo offer a degree of trust and stability that is seldom seen in the stablecoin space. Yet those features alone do not secure USD1 a place in the ranks of the largest stablecoins. Deploying USD1 on the Binance Smart Chain is a clear signal that WLFI is positioning itself as a serious contender in the global stablecoin market. By choosing BNB Chain as the platform for its first major deployment, WLFI is leveraging the speed and low transaction costs associated with Binance’s blockchain. This provides a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving DeFi space, where efficiency and scalability are paramount. Successfully testing cross-chain transfers between Ethereum and BNB Chain has allowed the USD1 stablecoin to position itself as a key player in bridging ecosystems. It enables users to move easily and efficiently between disparate blockchain environments. That~s not just a cool party trick; it enhances the immediate liquidity, not to mention the perceived (and actual) accessibility, of the USD1 as a payment medium for institutions that want to integrate stablecoin-based transactions into their business. The next question, of course, is how many other blockchains are likely to interface with the USD1, directly or via smart contracts. Looking Ahead: What This Means for the Future Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial is taking many steps to establish its stablecoin as a key player in the global financial world. A USD1 airdrop is just one of them. The World Liberty USD stablecoin has the potential to become a vital tool for both institutional and retail users—for the former, particularly in a world where regulations are in flux and for the latter, especially in a world where traditional USD-denominated financial products and services are often inaccessible. Trump’s team has promised security, compliance, interoperability among different decentralized finance platforms, and something very much like a ‘normal’ financial ecosystem as part of the deal. This airdrop’s success could indicate a real-world use case shift for stablecoin projects, like the USD1, that seek to find a digital dollar equivalent. As these payment systems gain ground, the airdrop could well mark the first step toward a broader adoption trend for the project—part of a wider shift in the payments space that increasingly looks to next-gen digital assets like stablecoins. The cryptocurrency and blockchain communities will pivot closely to watch as more details unfold with USD1 and the ever-widening WLFI ecosystem. Many will have their eyes trained on the next moves in the stablecoin race. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The confirmation gives Atkins full authority to oversee the agency that regulates America’s capital markets, enforces securities laws and sets the tone for financial supervision under the Trump administration. Senate confirmation is a required step for SEC commissioners and chair appointments, giving lawmakers a chance to scrutinize nominees’ policy views and past records. While presidents nominate SEC leaders, they cannot take office without Senate approval. The process ensures that leadership of a key financial watchdog reflects both executive priorities and legislative oversight.

He is expected to steer the agency in a more market-friendly direction. His nomination was backed by Republicans who view him as a voice for streamlined regulation and crypto innovation. “His tenure will mark a pivotal moment to roll back harmful Biden-era policies, promote capital formation, and enhance opportunities for retail investors,” said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott.

Critics say the SEC had taken a more aggressive approach toward emerging financial technologies. “I have seen how ambiguous and non-existent regulations for digital assets create uncertainty in the market and inhibit innovation,” he wrote in his testimony. The comment hinted at a likely easing of enforcement in the crypto space. SEC’s New Chair Inherits Agency at Crossroads of Market Reform Atkins served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008. He later founded Patomak Global Partners, a Washington-based advisory firm for banks and financial institutions. He also supported crypto industry interests through his work with the Digital Chamber. There, he pushed for regulatory clarity without heavy-handed intervention. Last month, Atkins disclosed up to $6m in crypto-related investments in his ethics filing, including stakes in Anchorage Digital and Securitize. His nomination drew criticism from Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who pointed to his support for deregulation before the 2008 financial crisis. The Senate Banking Committee had advanced his nomination on a narrow 13 to 11 vote. The final vote reflected deep partisan divisions. Still, Atkins’ confirmation was widely expected since Trump had signaled a desire to overhaul financial regulation and replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler. Now confirmed, Atkins will lead the SEC during a pivotal period. The agency is facing market structure reforms and growing pressure around digital asset oversight. It is also confronting broader questions about the future role of federal financial regulators.

On-chain volume for stablecoins hit a never-before-seen $72 billion in a single day, the highest level since February. Moreover, the daily active addresses for stablecoins have crossed 300,000, which is a clear sign of real-world adoption of these digital assets in financial activities. In a way, stablecoins are quietly becoming one of the biggest forces in the financial ecosystem.

Among the major players are USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin). They see massive growth, absolutely, and in terms of activity on blockchains, Berachain, Tron, and USDT (Tether) see a lot of it. Those three names there—they see a lot of movement relative to stablecoin activity. Activity that, by and large, sees massive success. Stablecoin activity on these chains just saw a lot of movement. This is very good activity for cross-border payments and DeFi. In the past 7 days, stablecoins(USDT&USDC) on #Tron increased by $396M, and stablecoins(USDT&USDC) on #Berachain decreased by $269.56M. https://t.co/yr8wn96ApU pic.twitter.com/y8UY8piIqJ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 7, 2025 The rapid spread of stablecoins brings many effects. Not only are they gaining traction in the cryptocurrency universe, but they are also starting to gain acceptance in the broad arena of financial systems. What is remarkable about the stablecoin is that it offers the faster transaction times of cryptocurrencies, along with lower fees, compared to traditional financial systems. It is hard to believe that a means of payment not tied to any legal jurisdiction, with no money-back guarantees and no recourse in a court of law, could ever be more stable than the products of our best central banks. Yet that is a claim some stablecoins make. Some use the term “cryptocurrency”; some call them “digital currencies” or “digital assets”. Either way, the stablecoin is a potential game changer. Stablecoins Reach All-Time Highs: A New Digital Economy A recent report by IntoTheBlock stated that stablecoins reached an all-time high (ATH) of $220 billion in circulation during the first quarter of 2025. Not only is this figure a significant milestone for the crypto space, but it also surpasses the GDP of some countries. This underscores the size and influence of this new digital asset. The stablecoin market has now reached such a magnitude in circulation that we can safely say we’re in the early stages of a fundamental shift in the global monetary infrastructure. The trend of digital fiat currencies is accompanied by the growth of stablecoins. The central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that governments and financial institutions are looking into these days are a potential outcome of this exploration. In many respects, stablecoins are already doing the work necessary to prepare the path for the digitalization of traditional fiat currencies. For the most part, they do this through exemplifying what digital currencies tethered to tangible assets can look like. 1/ Stablecoins have quietly become one of the biggest forces in finance. With the right legislation, they can shift entire economies—making payments faster, cheaper, and borderless for everyone. The rails are ready. Regulation is the missing piece https://t.co/W8TSDfvomK pic.twitter.com/M0fu2VN0E4 — Concordium (@ConcordiumNet) April 8, 2025 What’s particularly noteworthy about stablecoins is how they provide an easy bridge between the traditional finance world and the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem. These digital assets offer the kind of stability that fiat currencies provide, yet they’re built on the now-familiar blockchain architecture, which promises (and delivers) a good measure of enhanced transparency, security, and speed in the transactions they make possible. With the right kind of regulatory framework, stablecoins could overtake global finance. The Future of Payments: Borderless and Faster People are not just thinking about cryptocurrencies in new ways because of stablecoins; they are now seeing stablecoins as tools that can be used just about every day, for every sort of transaction imaginable. Cryptocurrencies associated with stablecoins—USD Coin, for example—can be deposited and also withdrawn. When you deposit USD Coin, it goes into an account held by a company that mints the coin. When you withdraw, your funds come back to you in the form of the coin. For example, in nations experiencing elevated inflation or have unstable monetary systems, stablecoins provide an assured and secure avenue for individuals to keep their assets intact and engage in day-to-day economic interactions. But the advantages of stablecoins extend beyond private individuals. Businesses and financial intermediaries are likely to find the growing use of stablecoins associated with two important features of these digital currencies: efficiency and lower costs. As stablecoins are adopted more widely, these two features will become much clearer. Legislation and the Path Forward Stablecoin’s future is closely linked to the legislation and regulation appropriate to them. In many countries, the regulatory frameworks are still under development, and the legal status of stablecoins is a gray area. Yet, with stablecoins prompting ever-greater attention from regulators and central bankers, we can expect that clear and comprehensive guidelines will soon emerge. A clearly articulated regulatory environment can provide the essential underpinning for stablecoins to thrive, giving businesses and consumers the confidence to embrace these digital assets in a significantly more mainstream manner. The prospects of stablecoins effecting payment and transforming the world of cross-border finance are huge, and with the appropriate legislative cover, they could play a key role in the emergence of a genuinely global digital economy. Conclusion: A New Global Payment System Stablecoins are increasing in adoption, volume, and influence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They are becoming a central part of not just a new digital financial world, but of the actual global economy, too. And this is happening in relative silence, without the high drama of a public reckoning with regulators. If you think of DeFi as a new technology stack that has the potential to enable a much more performant global financial system, then stablecoins are key to the stack. The infrastructure of the financial world is growing and evolving. Its new payment system—enabled mainly by stablecoins—is replacing the old one. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The tokens that have been targeted by this decision span a range from the quite familiar to the less popular in the crypto space, and many of them seem to be experiencing sharp price drops in the aftermath of the announcement. The decision by Binance underscores the exchange’s ongoing efforts to curtail the number of questionable listings it has on its platform and to improve the overall trading experience of users. Affected Tokens and Market Reaction Those tokens that have been marked for deletion include: $BADGER, $BAL, $BETA, $CREAM, $CTXC, $ELF, $FIRO, $HARD, $NULS, $PROS, $SNT, $TROY, $UFT, and $VIDT. Following the announcement, the value of these tokens has taken a nosedive, and market sentiment indicates to us that the fear of having such a liquidity issue in a down market is the real reason for this event. The most remarkable declines have been observed in the price of $BAL (Balancer), which fell by 10% and is now at $0.99. Likewise, $BADGER, the native token of the Badger DAO ecosystem, also saw a decrease of 9% over this same timeframe and now is at $1.011. The largest decline, however, was in the price of $CREAM (Cream Finance), which saw a dramatic 20% drop and now is at $3.07. JUST IN: Binance reveals results of first delisting vote — 14 tokens to be removed on April 16. Affected tokens include: $BADGER , $BAL , $BETA , $CREAM , $CTXC , $ELF , $FIRO , $HARD , $NULS , $PROS , $SNT , $TROY , $UFT , and $VIDT . Prices dropped sharply after the announcement: $BAL … pic.twitter.com/mOhrRG4Cmf — Followin (@followin_io) April 8, 2025 The steep price drops are no shock, as people working in the markets tend to move quickly when they hear news of a token being delisted and sell off to avoid holding an asset that could become illiquid if it doesn’t have an exchange to trade on. And when one of the top exchanges bites the bullet and decides to delist a token, as Binance has with a number of tokens recently, the market reacts aggressively—not just because of the immediate potential loss of trading volume, but also due to fears that the asset might be heading down an illiquid path. Why Are Tokens Being Delisted? The delisting process at Binance aims to ensure that the tokens listed on its platform maintain a standard of quality. The exchange has levels of preemptive warnings for tokens that are on the verge of being delisted. Then it’s not just Binance doing the delisting. There’s a fair number of exchanges working in parallel here as far as I can tell. Pushing these tokens off their platforms is generally good for the health of the crypto ecosystem. Binance’s announcement didn’t provide any immediate specifics about why the 14 tokens were being delisted. But this kind of announcement is usually made for a variety of reasons, like very low trading volume, a project that lacks a community or any development going on, or potential legal issues (which many projects are now facing). In the case of the tokens being delisted today, I can’t find any potential legal problem with them, and they clearly have very low trading volume. They may have also been well-known in the DeFi space at one time, but market interest in them is way down. The DeFi project behind the token probably has little relevance these days in terms of development or use case. Although being removed from a listing can negatively affect a project and its community, it does not have to be the terminal event for the token. Some projects may opt to place more focus on obtaining listings on other exchanges. Others may concentrate on trying to fix the problems that caused the delisting in the first place so that they can achieve a better market standing. However, in the immediate aftermath of a Bitcoin exchange declaring a token ineligible for trading, the impact is felt more acutely by the users and traders of that token. The Broader Implications of Delisting on Binance When Binance decided to drop these tokens, it was a clear statement about their competitive nature. Tokens that an exchange can even almost provide visibility for, can also obviously be almost provided liquidity, uh, for. And a token—its access just to a global user base—first of all, and then second, to being perceived as not just some token that some people have heard of but as one that’s, you know, potentially driving innovation or whatever, is just completely critical. And so I think Binance delisting these tokens is just saying as much about those tokens as it is about any platform that can drop a token! And by the way, Binance can drop a token. The news serves as a cautionary tale for traders regarding the risks of trading in underdeveloped or illiquid cryptocurrencies. It brings home the necessity of grasping the probable dangers of holding assets that could be delisted at any moment, and it makes crystal clear the need for everyone to keep a close eye on all cryptocurrency exchange-related news. The projects issuing the affected tokens might view their recent delistings as a chance to revisit their game plans. If you get delisted from a major exchange, it is a setback, but it could also be an opportunity to flag your project for potential investors, have an internal chat about its direction with the core team, and maybe think about pivoting. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Affected Tokens The first-ever delisting vote held by Binance has created quite a buzz in the crypto space. The tokens that were voted on and subsequently affected experienced some nasty price drops, and those drops serve to remind everyone just how important exchange listings are to digital assets. The immediate aftermath of the vote has seen the affected tokens and their communities under quite a bit of selling pressure and with some pretty declining prices. With that said, though, this moment could serve as a crucial turning point for the delisted tokens and their communities. Because if they aren’t going to be listed on Binance anymore, then it really has to be a moment of regrouping and adaptation. In terms of Binance, its resolution underscores a sturdy dedication to keeping the bar high for the assets it lists. The crypto industry is full of companies that pay lip service to “compliance” and “regulatory engagement,” but Binance is taking a different approach: it is now proactive in ensuring that only what it sees as the most viable projects are listed on its platform. Traders can take from this announcement a couple of reminders about the asset class they work in. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Large deposits and sales of the cryptocurrency have been reported by various trading platforms. One of the most notable events concerned a mysterious trader who goes by the handle @pumpdotfun (or Pumpfun) and seems to be in the business of large-scale depositing. After a brief hiatus, this trader has returned to Kraken with another hefty deposit of $SOL. Pumpfun is not the only whale on the move, however. A Closer Look at Pumpfun’s Moves Only 20 minutes have passed since Pumpfun put another 84,358 $SOL—worth a stunning $9.32 million—into the Kraken exchange. This latest move from this private whale, who has yet to reveal his identity, is just the tip of the iceberg. Pumpfun has already sloshed over 2,883,418 $SOL into Kraken—an unbelievable amount of cash worth around $543 million at an average price of about $189 per token. Pumpfun( @pumpdotfun ) deposited 84,358 $SOL ($9.32M) to #Kraken again 20 mins ago. So far, #Pumpfun has deposited 2,883,418 $SOL ($543.5M) to #Kraken at $189 and sold 264,373 $SOL for 41.64M $USDC at $158. https://t.co/qUlZ3FNshD pic.twitter.com/YD52rtrbOp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 8, 2025 Pumpfun has been nothing short of strategic in its trading activity. In conjunction with the hefty deposits, the whale has partaken in offloading portions of its holdings. By far, the most notable of these has been a sale of 264,373 $SOL for 41.64 million USDC, which was executed at an average price of 158 $SOL. This combo of deposits and sales suggests that Pumpfun is engaged in some not-so-obvious market-making. Market observers are closely watching Pumpfun’s next move. The scale of the transactions is huge. The deposits into Kraken signal that Pumpfun may be getting ready for another big sale, or possibly several big sales, or even a take-profit moment, depending on what appears to be a rather murky broader strategy. Notably, the deposits signal a progressively larger sales moment of what was once a ‘buy the dip’ strategy. Another Whale Sells $10.7M in $SOL In an increasingly dramatic development, another whale, this one holding a staggering 1.32 million $SOL—valued at approximately $192 million at current prices—has also been active recently on the market. This whale has other plans, though. Just 30 minutes ago, it sold off 100,000 $SOL, valued at around $10.7 million. This massive sale has drawn attention not just because of the whale’s size and the scale of its holdings but also for what it might mean for the future price of $SOL. What makes this sale especially noteworthy is the context surrounding the whale’s prior actions. Approximately 15 days ago, the whale unstaked a total of 1.32 million $SOL, a move that raised eyebrows at the time. Following this, the whale deposited 1.2 million $SOL into Kamino, a decentralized liquidity protocol, and borrowed $20 million in the process. This indicates that the whale may have been looking to leverage its $SOL holdings, perhaps for liquidity purposes or to cover other positions. Given the sale’s timing, it’s possible that the whale is now divesting itself of some $SOL to cover the borrowed funds or to manage risk. A whale holding 1.32M $SOL ($192M) just sold 100,000 $SOL ($10.7M) 30 minutes ago. 15 days ago, the whale unstaked 1.32M $SOL , deposited 1.2M $SOL into #Kamino , and borrowed 20M $USDC . He likely sold $SOL to cover the loan. https://t.co/2ucFr3IYiw pic.twitter.com/paOLh9dt4O — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 9, 2025 Although it is hard to pinpoint the exact motivations behind the whale’s big moves, these large trades frequently signal a drive to manage risk or to snag some value at major price points. The whale’s choice to part with 100,000 $SOL after picking up 20 million USDC suggests they are very much in the liquidity management camp and possibly looking to hedge future volatility in the $SOL market. Potential Market Impact The combined actions of Pumpfun and the unnamed whale are making the $SOL market go absolutely berserk. This is obviously a problem because when you shove a ton of assets into an exchange like Kraken, you’re essentially making the price of that asset go up. In this case, both cryptids are clearly making big moves and using that to inflate the price of $SOL—almost like a pump and dump. Kraken has itself seen some serious movements of late, and is currently one of the bigger players in the $SOL space, especially in terms of volatility. Disproportionate affects on the price of a cryptocurrency, like $SOL, can often be traced to whale activity. $SOL has experienced turbulence this summer, but it has a relatively stable price now. Traders must be on high alert for any further actions from the large holders of $SOL, as these may cause big shifts in market sentiment. Simultaneously, the reality that these whales are so energetically interacting with decentralized liquidity protocols like Kamino prompts a re-examination of what might be driving their engagement. With what can only be described as a lot of $SOL, it’s clear that some investors are using very sophisticated strategies to attempt to wring out as much value as possible—beyond the ordinary price speculation in which most crypto investors engage—from their holdings. And those sophisticated strategies seem to mostly involve providing liquidity in decentralized exchanges like Kamino. Conclusion: What’s Next for $SOL? $SOL has been the recent center of attention among crypto projects where not only has it been mentioned here but so too have significant deposits and sales from leading whales. Some are speculating this might be the precursor to the next big thing for the token. Not that anyone could with certainty predict the next big direction for $SOL, but I would suspect that in the raw movement of large $$ amounts of deposits and sales, we’re seeing a potential change in sentiment, something for which the $SOL token could be theoretically user-upgraded. The crypto community is closely observing to see if Pumpfun and the other whale will continue to make moves that could further impact the price of $SOL. Given the size and scale of their holdings, these whales are likely to be influential in the near-term price action of Solana, and their decisions will almost certainly affect the broader market dynamics in the next few days. As always in crypto, the actions of a few powerful players can ripple out to create major shifts in the market, and $SOL may be poised for more surprises ahead.

By locking down supply, staking-enabled ETFs may increase demand for ETH and raise its price as adoption increases. Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange have filed proposals, with the SEC’s deadline for approval or rejection set for the end of October. Now that crypto-friendly Paul Atkins has been confirmed as the new SEC chairman, analysts believe that ETF innovation, including staking, could accelerate.

43155053,https://nulltx.com/?p=147889,1744262445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Mysterious “7 Siblings” Group Moves $8.3 Million in MKR: What’s Behind the Massive Token Shift?,https://nulltx.com/mysterious-7-siblings-group-moves-8-3-million-in-mkr-whats-behind-the-massive-token-shift/,"In a development that has left the crypto community abuzz, the obscure group known as ‘7 Siblings’ has recently unlocked a large amount of $MKR tokens from MakerDAO; this has left many in the community concerned over possible market implications. The group unlocked a total of 7,000 $MKR, worth about $8.3 million at current prices. Since unlocking the tokens just five hours ago, the group has already sold off a portion of their holdings. This has left many in the community speculating over what exactly is going on. A Strategic Move or a Market Dump? The immediate action taken by the “7 Siblings” was to sell 706.7 $MKR tokens worth about $861,000 for 594.95 $ETH. This trade, which comes to an average of around 1,218 $MKR per token, has raised quite a few eyebrows. While significant, the sale of 706.7 tokens is almost insignificant in the larger scheme of things, since there are so many more tokens yet to be sold. And even with this sale, the group still possesses a staggering amount of $MKR tokens, 6,293 to be exact, which on the open market translates into $7.47 million. Many are now asking: Why would an entity of such size and obscurity make such a big move? The market is no stranger to big token transfers and to significant sell-offs, but what makes the “7 Siblings” really interesting is the group’s anonymity. With no clear ties to MakerDAO or any other major public associations, their actions seem to be extremely well-planned and purposeful—though exactly what they are planning and for what reason remains a total mystery. The Impact on MakerDAO and the Broader Market One must also consider the timing of the sell-off. Although nearly $861,000 worth of $MKR tokens sold off may not have an immediate impact on the MakerDAO ecosystem, the potential subsequent sale of a greater number of $MKR tokens could very well pose a larger risk. Ever since the price of $MKR began not just decreasing but also showing increasing volatility, market participants had started watching for any signs of significant changes in the large holder accounts of $MKR. Given how pivotal the token is to not just the governance, but also the functioning of the entire MakerDAO system and, by extension, the DeFi ecosystem, much larger implications were at play with this sell-off. The mystery group “7 Siblings” may be dumping $8.3M worth of $MKR ! 5 hours ago, this entity unlocked 7,000 $MKR (~$8.3M) from #MakerDAO and has since sold 706.7 $MKR ($861K) for 594.95 $ETH , at an average price of $1,218. Now, 6,293 $MKR (~$7.47M) remains in their holdings,… pic.twitter.com/P0FgCqa2rg — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 9, 2025 If the 7,000 MKR tokens keep getting traded at the current rate, we could see the token’s price pushed down as the market reacts to the news. The price point of $1,218 per token that was observed when the trade happened is notable. It’s a drop, for sure, from previous price points at which MKR was trading. How far and fast MKR liquidates seems in large part to be a function (no pun intended) of how far and fast the group that has amassed a large stash of the tokens wishes to push down their price. For MakerDAO, which is already countering the riddle of DeFi market swings and governance verities, the actions of this secretive group could add another layer of uncertainty. It’s possible, though, that the group is playing a longer game, and the sell-off is part of a larger plan. The whole thing could thus turn into quite the controversy, depending on how the group decides to manage the remaining MKR tokens they hold. By the way, does anyone even know if these guys are good or bad for Maker? What We Know About the “7 Siblings” The “7 Siblings” are still a relatively obscure entity in the world of cryptocurrency. Yet they have recently been the focus of some attention—and even concern—because of their large and apparently coordinated activities within the ecosystem of MakerDAO, one of cryptocurrency’s more important projects. Who the “7 Siblings” are, and what they’re about, remains anyone’s guess. But their name is certainly good for a few raised eyebrows, with speculation about them reaching and surpassing the event horizon of a good ol’ Bay Area mystery. In crypto, large entities or wallets being anonymous is not uncommon, but it does give an air of mystery to their actions. Speculation has run rampant around the decision to unlock and begin selling a large amount of $MKR tokens with no clear reason given behind it. Could they be trying to manipulate the market for short-term gains? Are they trying to pull off the ol’ robotrading market-make trick? Or could they be trying to use the unlocked tokens to gain control over the MakerDAO ecosystem? Or, you know, maybe they’re just selling some of their assets. Conclusion: Is the Market in Danger? The group’s actions have now raised serious questions within the broader crypto community. With the remaining 6,293 $MKR tokens still in the possession of the ‘7 Siblings,’ there is now the potential for up to 6,293 more tokens to be liquidated depending on the group’s token handling decisions. Market volatility is a definite possibility. Though we can presently see the effects of the $861,000 sell-off, it’s the prospect of more moves from this enigmatic entity that has people agitated. Is this a single liquidation event or the first step in a much larger plan? Only time will tell. What remains undebatable is the fact that the “7 Siblings ” are keeping a very close eye on the MKR market and that they may well be the ones shaping its future in the next several days.

43156836,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=120704,1744262463,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here’s Why XRP Could Hit $29 if Bitcoin Claims $170K Following XRP/BTC Bullish MA Cross,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/04/10/heres-why-xrp-could-hit-29-if-bitcoin-claims-170k-following-xrp-btc-bullish-ma-cross/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-why-xrp-could-hit-29-if-bitcoin-claims-170k-following-xrp-btc-bullish-ma-cross,"A market analyst recently suggested that XRP has the potential to reach a new peak on the XRP/BTC pair following a bullish cross against Bitcoin. Notably, XRP is beginning to show signs of renewed momentum after a rough week that has seen the asset dip 2.89% in the last seven days amid widespread market volatility. Despite the bearish cloud, XRP has staged a strong recovery push, recently reclaiming the $2 mark and notching an impressive 12.38% gain in the past 24 hours. This resurgence comes at a critical moment, as a rare bullish crossover has just materialized on the XRP/BTC weekly chart.XRP/BTC Pair Observes Bullish Crossover Technical analyst EGRAG Crypto recently spotlighted this bullish signal, which involves the 55-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossing above the 155-week Simple Moving Average (MA). For context, this crossover occurred on Feb. 17, 2025, two weeks after the ongoing market-wide turbulence ensued. During this period, XRP witnessed consecutive declines against BTC, as the firstborn crypto showed less volatility. Interestingly, the February 2025 crossover marked just the second time in XRP/BTC history that such a pattern has formed. XRPBTC 1W Chart | EGRAG Crypto Notably, the last time it happened was on May 15, 2017. What followed that previous crossover was a staggering 958.97% surge in the XRP/BTC ratio , pushing the pair from deep lows to a peak of 0.00022104 BTC per XRP. This occurred as XRP skyrocketed to the ATH of $3.8 in January 2018.According to EGRAG, the current setup seems to mirror that historic pattern. Citing this historical precedent, the analyst suggests the same explosive run from 2017 could materialize once more. A Massive XRP Uptrend After Downward RetestFollowing the February 2025 crossover, XRP/BTC attempted to retest the 55 EMA but veered off before touching it. If the pair manages a proper retest now, it could crash from the current 0.00002424 level to 0.00001850. With Bitcoin trading around $80,000 in such a scenario, XRP would drop to near the $1.48 price point.Now, after this slump, XRP could finally stage the much-needed rally. Assuming XRP/BTC repeats the previous 958% rally, EGRAG indicates that the ratio would climb to about 0.000171 BTC. However, if Bitcoin trades at the Fibonacci 0.702 level near $97,000 when the pair reaches 0.000171, this will place XRP at roughly $16.5. Nonetheless, if the firstborn crypto resumes its uptrend and breaks into new highs, XRP could achieve even more dramatic prices.For instance, should Bitcoin reach $130,000, XRP would hover around $22 at an XRP/BTC ratio of 0.000171. A $150,000 BTC would push XRP to $25, while a climb to $170,000 could catapult XRP to a formidable $29. These projections focus on the XRP/BTC ratio maintaining momentum from its February bullish crossover and Bitcoin sustaining its macro uptrend.In addition to this, EGRAG's chart reveals four bottoms for XRP/BTC since 2014, with the latest forming in early 2025. Each bottom historically preceded a significant upward move, and the current market situation suggests a similar breakout could be underway.At press time, XRP changes hands at $1.98, having lost the $2 mark again. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades for $81,753, dropping from an earlier intraday peak of $82,743. With these current prices, the XRP/BTC pair stands at 0.000024.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-04-10 05:21:03
43155121,https://coinpaper.com/8449/paul-atkins-officially-confirmed-as-new-sec-chair,1744262548,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Paul Atkins Officially Confirmed as New SEC Chair,https://coinpaper.com/8449/paul-atkins-officially-confirmed-as-new-sec-chair,"Atkins was a former SEC commissioner and co-chair of the Token Alliance, and brings a lot of experience from both traditional finance and the digital asset space. His confirmation coincides with a broader push to modernize outdated US securities laws, which was mentioned during a House Committee hearing that placed a lot of emphasis on the need for clear, crypto-specific regulations. Meanwhile, Thailand is also tightening its oversight of digital assets with stricter anti-crime measures targeting foreign platforms and scam-related activities. Paul Atkins to Lead SEC Paul Atkins has officially been confirmed as the new chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a 52-44 Senate vote that mostly followed party lines. The confirmation on April 9 happened after President Donald Trump nominated the former SEC commissioner and Wall Street consultant late last year. Atkins previously served as a commissioner from 2002 to 2008 during the global financial crisis, and he is expected to usher in a pro-crypto shift at the agency. Senate vote on Paul Atkins (Source: US Senate ) SEC commissioners welcomed Atkins back to the agency in a joint statement , and they are very optimistic about his leadership. With deep ties to both the financial and digital asset sectors, Atkins brings a wealth of experience to the role. He founded Patomak Global Partners in 2009, which is a firm that focuses on regulatory compliance and risk management, and until late 2024, he served as co-chair of the crypto advocacy group Token Alliance. Atkins will replace Mark Uyeda, who served as acting chair since Jan. 20 after the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler. Under Gensler, the SEC pursued many very aggressive enforcement actions against crypto firms. In contrast, the Trump administration has already taken a much friendlier stance on digital assets, and even created a Crypto Task Force and dropped several of the Gensler-era investigations. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott is also confident in Atkins' ability to support innovation while providing regulatory clarity. At a Senate confirmation hearing in March, Atkins said that one of his top priorities will be to establish a coherent and principled regulatory framework for digital assets. However, Atkins’ confirmation was delayed due to the need to file several financial disclosures. These filings were prompted by his marriage into a billionaire family linked to TAMKO Building Products LLC, which is a roofing company that saw over $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023. Paul Atkins According to Fortune, Atkins and his wife, Sarah Humphreys Atkins, have a combined net worth of more than $327 million. His disclosures also revealed personal holdings of up to $6 million in crypto-related investments, including stakes in Anchorage Digital and Securitize, which are both key players in the digital asset ecosystem. Outdated SEC Laws Hold Back Digital Assets At a House Committee hearing on April 9, legal experts and industry leaders pointed out some of the challenges posed by outdated US securities laws in regulating digital assets. Rodrigo Seira, special counsel at Cooley LLP, testified that the existing regulatory framework under the SEC is fundamentally incompatible with the realities of the crypto industry. He argued that despite claims that crypto projects can register with the SEC, the experience of numerous companies suggests otherwise. Seira explained that no crypto project has successfully navigated the SEC’s registration process without falling into prolonged legal uncertainty or collapsing under regulatory burdens. Rodrigo Seira (Source: House Committee on Financial Services ) While acknowledging that crypto promoters who raise funds should be subject to securities laws, Seira criticized the current process, which he said requires projects to operate like traditional public companies. This, he argued, places an unreasonable strain on digital asset ventures that differ quite a bit from traditional securities issuers. The hearing was titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: Aligning the US Securities Laws for the Digital Age,” and also included testimony from WilmerHale partner Tiffany J. Smith, Polygon chief legal officer Jake Werrett, and Alexandra Thorn from the Center for American Progress. The discussion centered on the need to modernize regulations to boost innovation without compromising investor protections. Representative Bryan Steil, chair of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, opened the hearing by acknowledging that many regulatory barriers were established under the previous administration. He stated that the current administration, under President Donald Trump, is working to reform these laws through new legislation. Representative Bryan Steil (Source: House Committee on Financial Services ) One such measure, the STABLE Act , was recently advanced by the House Financial Services Committee and aims to regulate US dollar-pegged stablecoins. In the Senate, the GENIUS Act is also moving forward with its focus on reserve requirements and anti-money laundering compliance for stablecoin issuers. According to Steil, the next major objective is the advancement of comprehensive market structure legislation to clearly define legal categories for digital assets and outline the roles of federal agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Representative Ro Khanna added momentum to the conversation by stating at a recent conference that this long-awaited market structure bill is likely to pass before the end of the year. Thailand Tightens Grip on Crypto Crime Other countries are also changing how they approach digital assets. Thailand is stepping up its efforts to combat online crimes involving digital assets through newly approved legal amendments. On April 8, the country’s cabinet passed a resolution endorsing changes to its emergency decrees on digital asset businesses and cybercrime prevention. These amendments were announced by the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, and they aim to curb the use of digital assets in illicit activities by implementing tighter regulations and penalties. Part of the Thai SEC announcement (Source: SEC ) Under the new measures, crypto asset service providers will be required to monitor and report transactions linked to online scams, and suspend suspicious accounts. A key focus is on cracking down on so-called mule accounts that are used in scams. Violators are facing penalties of up to $8,700 and three years in prison. The amendments also grant authorities the power to block foreign crypto service providers from operating in Thailand, which is intended to mitigate some of the risks tied to money laundering and unregulated platforms. The legal changes are not limited to crypto-focused businesses. Commercial banks, telecom providers, and social media platforms are now also held jointly responsible if they fail to meet standards set by regulatory authorities to prevent cybercrimes. This broadens the scope of accountability and clearly proves that the government is focused on tackling the issue on multiple fronts. One of the more major aspects of the legislation is the explicit restriction of foreign cryptocurrency peer-to-peer service providers. These platforms are now classified as digital asset exchanges under Thai law and are barred from serving local users. The government wants to confine such services to local providers in order to better manage compliance and reduce vulnerabilities. Despite these regulatory crackdown, Thailand continues to show interest in fostering controlled crypto adoption. Trials for crypto payments have been launched in select cities like Phuket, and regulators are exploring the possibility of approving crypto exchange-traded funds.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-10 05:22:28

Known for its strategic and high-profile investments, the firm has subscribed to 250 million WLFI tokens, worth $25 million, at a price of $0.10 per token. This purchase has raised eyebrows across the industry, particularly because of the high premium at which the tokens were acquired. DWF Labs’ Purchase: A Bold Move To put things into perspective, DWF Labs’ acquisition of WLFI comes just days after they made a payment of $25 million to WLFI’s multi-signature wallet in exchange for 250 million tokens. The price of $0.10 per token marks a significant leap from earlier fundraising rounds for WLFI. For comparison, the seed round for WLFI tokens priced each unit at just $0.015, meaning DWF Labs’ acquisition price is more than six times higher than the initial offering. Even in the second round, the price was $0.05 per token, making DWF Labs’ latest investment exactly double the previous rate. DWF Labs Just Subscribed 250M $WLFI at $0.10 — 6.67x the Seed Price! Something huge might be brewing around WLFI… Just four days ago, DWF Labs sent 25M USDC to WLFI's multi-sig wallet and in return, received 250M #WLFI tokens at $0.10 per token — a price that’s: pic.twitter.com/2Fu16AqYKE — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 9, 2025 Although this large-scale investment in WLFI comes as a surprise, particularly given that WLFI has yet to initiate an official public sale at this price point, it has ignited speculation that something of significance may be brewing for the project. After all, it’s not every day you hear about a firm like DWF Labs paying a premium for a token, especially one that’s nominally in a “no-price” market. Why the Premium? This move raises the essential question: Why pay such a premium for WLFI tokens? Given that the public sale for WLFI hasn’t occurred at the $0.10 price, it’s unclear why DWF Labs would opt to pay a price for WLFI tokens that is higher than what might be available to regular investors down the road. This purchase really suggests two things. One: DWF Labs has some special knowledge about the future worth of WLFI. Two: More directly, something big is about to be announced that will raise the token’s value. In the crypto world, timing and access to information are everything. By sinking such high-brow investment into this project, DWF Labs might be positioning itself to gain a first-mover advantage, whether that’s through the launch of a major feature, a partnership announcement, or some groundbreaking development in the WLFI ecosystem. With crypto markets notoriously volatile, such strategic investments often indicate confidence in the future trajectory of a project, which soon may make a big splash. WLFI involving a well-known company raises questions about the project roadmap. Although relatively quiet on the official announcement front, this sudden inflow of funds could signal that WLFI is just about to unveil a major partnership or product. Obviously, investors will now be watching closely to see if any progress on the WLF-I front can explain why DWF Labs was willing to pay such a premium. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for WLFI? This investment could mark a crucial turning point for WLFI. As is the case often in the crypto space, early investors tend to get the best deals, and DWF Labs’ involvement could help provide credibility and visibility for the project. When a firm with the track record of DWF Labs shows interest, it often brings along the promise of more institutional support, partnerships, and perhaps even further investment in the future. Additionally, the reality that WLFI has not yet formally started its public sale at the $0.10 price point could indicate that this is a handsomely engineered event to stir up momentum in front of a more sizable unveiling. DWF Labs’ massive buy at a hefty price suggests quite the opposite of a lack of confidence in WLFI’s future, and this confidence might just be rubbing off on some other institutional or individual investors as they apparently get ready for some big news. The observers from both the community and the industry are soon going to witness some further developments. We do not yet know what WLFI plans to do with the funds: will it launch a new product, sign an exclusive partnership, or make some sort of major announcement that justifies the price it pays for the assets? Time will tell, but this is already clear: DWF Labs isn’t going to stop at just this initial public offering. To conclude, the first sign that something much bigger might be going on behind the scenes at WLFI could be this strategic acquisition by DWF Labs. Speculation is the lifeblood of the crypto market; with DWF Labs involved, it’s only a matter of time before WLFI becomes the subject of some pretty intense speculation.

In a sudden policy flip, Trump paused the global tariff war for 90 days, sending shockwaves through financial markets. Cryptocurrencies responded fast, with major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all soaring. As Trump announced a 90-day suspension of the tariff war with most countries, the cryptocurrency market rose sharply, with ETH rising 15% to over $1,600 and XRP rising 15.3% to over $2. The liquidation amount in 24 hours reached $587 million, and the short position liquidation… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 9, 2025 Crypto Rebounds After Weeks of Bloodbath After weeks of downward pressure from rising tariffs, crypto finally got a breather. Bitcoin jumped from $76K to $82K in just a few hours, reclaiming levels not seen since Sunday. Ethereum surged 15% to over $1,600, while XRP jumped 15.3% to cross $2. The total liquidations in the past 24 hours hit $587 million, with $374 million wiped out from short positions alone, according to Coinglass . Before the announcement, the crypto space was bleeding. Bitcoin had fallen to $74,000—the lowest in five months—after Trump launched a wave of tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. Ethereum and XRP were also down more than 20% each. But once the news of a 90-day pause broke, the tide turned fast. Tariff War Still Playing Hide ‘n’ Seek Interestingly, while Trump paused most tariffs, he also escalated things with China. Tariffs on Chinese goods were bumped up to 125%, following a sharp response from Beijing, which threatened 84% tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump justified the reason behind the move by accusing China of “disrespect” in trade negotiations. Despite the China clash, markets responded positively to the overall pause. The move was seen as a signal that Trump might be open to compromise. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump’s $750B Tariff Plan Is a Massive Wealth Shift, Says Billionaire Investor Chamath , Altcoins and Memecoins Join the Party Altcoins followed the surge.

Still, for a market that was in deep red just days ago, Trump’s pause has sparked real hope and reminded everyone that in crypto, one headline can change everything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SEC Greenlights Options Trading for Spot Ethereum ETFs in Historic Institutional Shift The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved options trading for several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ruling , made public on April 9, opens the door for institutional investors to employ sophisticated hedging and speculative strategies tied to Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The SEC's decision follows a proposed rule change originally filed by financial giant BlackRock on July 22, 2024, to allow options trading on its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The approval now extends to multiple Ethereum-based ETFs, including Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH). In its statement, the SEC explained that the proposed amendment to exchange rules will permit the listing and trading of options on these Ethereum funds, with the agency emphasizing the added utility this provides to market participants. “Options on the Trust will provide investors with an additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to spot Ether, as well as a hedging vehicle to meet their needs in connection with Ether products and positions,” the Commission noted in its communication with Nasdaq. The move is widely seen as a turning point for Ethereum’s legitimacy within traditional finance. Options are considered a vital component in portfolio risk management, offering investors the ability to hedge against downside volatility while enabling more dynamic trading strategies. While Bitcoin has long enjoyed a wider suite of financial instruments, Ether has remained somewhat sidelined—until now. Despite the July 2024 approval of spot Ether ETFs, market reception has been muted compared to the exuberant inflows seen in Bitcoin products. Data from VettaFi shows that BlackRock’s ETHA, one of the largest Ether ETFs, currently holds $1.8 billion in net assets, a staggering 56% drop from its early-year peak. This latest development could reignite interest. Analysts believe that the availability of options will not only enhance Ether’s appeal to risk-managed portfolios but also provide new pathways for market makers to ensure deeper liquidity and tighter spreads across Ether markets. Political Winds Favor Crypto The SEC’s greenlight also reflects a broader regulatory shift in Washington. Since President Donald Trump’s return to office, the agency has noticeably eased its aggressive stance on crypto enforcement. This shift has been surprisingly swift, catching even seasoned legal analysts off guard. Legal scholars from the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance noted that the regulatory softening under the new administration materialized much faster than anticipated, with multiple high-profile investigations into crypto firms being shelved. Among those off the hook are centralized exchange Gemini, public company Coinbase, decentralized protocol developer Uniswap Labs, and NFT marketplace OpenSea. Simultaneously, the US legislative landscape is making parallel progress. Pro-stablecoin bills are advancing through Congress, with the STABLE Act—focused on enshrining the legal use of stablecoins—passing the House Financial Services Committee, while the GENIUS Act, a Senate-led initiative to govern stablecoin issuance, made it through the Senate Banking Committee. These developments are paving the way for a more comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Lawmakers have also hinted that a sweeping crypto market structure bill is on the horizon and could be finalized before the end of 2025. Ethereum’s Next Chapter As Ethereum’s utility and legitimacy continue to expand, market observers are optimistic about the long-term prospects of the asset—even as Ether’s price currently lingers around $1,616, near a two-year low. The availability of options, combined with a more permissive regulatory environment, could catalyze a reversal in institutional sentiment. As investors weigh the impact of these changes, one thing is certain: Ethereum’s institutionalization has just entered a powerful new phase. 21Shares Files for Spot Dogecoin ETF with SEC, Signaling Serious Push for Meme Coin Legitimacy Meanwhile, digital asset manager 21Shares has officially filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Dogecoin ETF. The proposed ETF would mark a new chapter in the meme coin’s mainstream journey, offering traditional investors direct exposure to Dogecoin (DOGE) through a regulated financial product. The filing , submitted on April 9, comes amid a growing wave of applications from rival firms including Grayscale and Bitwise, both of which have also recently filed for spot Dogecoin ETFs. According to 21Shares’ filing, the ETF will be designed to track the real-time market price of Dogecoin. The fund will be supported by Coinbase Custody, which is proposed to act as the official custodian for the underlying assets. However, the application did not specify which US stock exchange would host the ETF, nor did it disclose the management fee or ticker symbol. What makes this filing particularly notable is the firm’s partnership with the Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, which will assist 21Shares in marketing the fund. The collaboration with House of Doge marks a rare formalization of community-led assets into structured, institutionally-accessible investment products. Dogecoin has “become more than a cryptocurrency: it represents a cultural and financial movement that continues to drive mainstream adoption,” said Duncan Moir, President of 21Shares. “With this ETF, DOGE offers investors a regulated avenue to be part of this exciting project.” While the S-1 filing represents a significant first step, 21Shares must still submit a 19b-4 filing—a formal request that the SEC must approve to amend the rules of a national securities exchange to allow the ETF to trade. This is where the process becomes more uncertain, as the SEC has yet to give clear guidance on whether meme coins like Dogecoin meet the criteria for spot ETF approval. Nonetheless, optimism remains high. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have estimated a 75% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Dogecoin ETF this year, reflecting a noticeable shift in regulatory attitudes. On the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, traders currently assign a 64% probability to a DOGE ETF approval in 2025. This environment is ripe for what Seyffart refers to as a “spaghetti cannon approach”, where issuers are testing the limits of what the SEC might approve under the current leadership. “Issuers will try to launch many different things and see what sticks,” Seyffart said in February. Beyond US borders, 21Shares is already taking steps to expand its Dogecoin product suite. Also on April 9, the firm announced the launch of a fully backed Dogecoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, in partnership with House of Doge. This European version of the DOGE fund will trade under the ticker “DOGE” and will carry a 2.5% management fee. By offering the product first in Europe, 21Shares is clearly testing international markets while building momentum ahead of a possible US launch. The firm has followed a similar strategy with its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, some of which launched in Europe well before regulatory approvals came through in the US. The Expanding Crypto ETF Landscape 21Shares is already among the most active players in the crypto ETF arena. Its US offerings currently include only spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs, but its ambition goes far beyond the two leading cryptocurrencies. The company filed for a spot Polkadot (DOT) ETF in February and previously filed for a spot XRP ETF in 2024. Dogecoin , originally launched in 2013 as a satirical response to the wild world of cryptocurrencies, has proven remarkably resilient. What began as a joke has evolved into a cultural and financial force, buoyed by grassroots support, viral online content, and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. A Turning Point for Meme Coins? If approved, the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF would be a watershed moment not only for Dogecoin but for the entire category of meme coins. With regulators seemingly more open to novel crypto assets—and institutional players like Coinbase and 21Shares backing them—Dogecoin might just lead the way in rewriting the rules of what’s considered investable in the world of finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-10 05:30:00

Although ETH has bounced back more than 13% from the lows of $1,400, whales have adopted the sell-on-rise strategy. Trump’s 90-day delay in tariff implementation has given some breather to the market; however, investors are still not gaining confidence over the asset class. Dormant Ethereum Whale Sells $16.86M Worth of ETH A veteran Ethereum investor has sold a massive 10,702 ETH, worth a staggering $16.86 million, at a price of $1,576 per token. Blockchain data reveals that the investor acquired the $ETH as early as 2016, when the cryptocurrency was priced at just $8, as per the Etherscan data . Interestingly, most of the Ethereum whales capitulating today refrained from selling when ETH price was above $4,000 in December last year. This latest transaction marks the holder’s return to activity after two years of dormancy, fueling speculation about the timing and strategy behind the move. Donald Trump’s DeFi project, World Liberty Financial , has also been selling ETH during this panic sell-off. On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez believes that this could be a great time to accumulate ETH. He noted that while the long-term ETH holders are in the capitulation mode, this development could signal a potential accumulation opportunity for contrarian investors. Martinez noted that new buyers have favourable risk-reward dynamics associated with this market condition. Source: Ali Martinez Is ETH Price Ready for A Bullish Reversal? Following the ETH price crash to $1,400 on Tuesday, the altcoin has recovered by a strong 13%, and is currently trading at $1612 levels, with daily trading volumes up by 36%, at over $35 billion. Analysts have started predicting a potential reversal henceforth. Popular crypto analyst Luciano_BTC noted that the chart shows promising signs of an ETH price breakou t after maintaining stability at a critical support level. A falling wedge pattern has emerged, often regarded as a precursor to bullish reversals. Source: Luciano_BTC If the trendline is breached, it could signal substantial upside potential, positioning Ethereum for significant gains. Another positive catalyst for the altcoin is that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved options trading for spot Ether ETF , which could lead to greater institutional participation.

One emerging contender capturing significant attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending and borrowing platform in its presale that is making headlines. The project has attracted more than 8100 investors because it currently sells at $0.025 through Phase 4 and the platform’s overall worth exceeds $6.5 million. Following another market increase the platform price will rise to $0.03 by increasing 20% over current market rates. The initial launch price is $0.06 but Phase 4 investors will recover 140% profit on their $0.025 purchase. Analysts are optimistic about MUTM’s growth trajectory, with some forecasts suggesting the token could reach $1.50 by the end of 2025. This projection represents a 5,900% increase from the current presale price, indicating that an initial investment of $500 could potentially grow to $30,000 within this timeframe. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum The investor sentiment-driven growth of MUTM relies on its basic DeFi lending model which provides its momentum for advancement. Through Phase 4 investors have an opportunity to acquire MUTM tokens at $0.025 yet the value will rise to $0.03 after the following period begins. Strategy-based MUTM investors will achieve a 140% profit estimation while the platform functions at $0.06 market value supported by its strong tokenomic foundation. The funding campaign for MUTM has attracted many investors who pushed the platform’s capitalization beyond $6.5 million thus proving market interest in platforms connecting lending resources to growth potentials. Through its automated Buy-and-Distribute mechanism the ecosystem of MUTM purchases tokens in the market and distributes them to stakers during specific time intervals. The model maintains regular market purchases which stands out as a rare phenomenon against the general volatile and speculative market character. Mutuum Finance is in the process of having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a key measure to enhance security and trust. The official audit report will be published on their social media once completed. Innovative growth strategy Mutuum Finance defines its identity through its development of mtToken technology which serves as an investment token for both ETH and DAI alongside additional deposit assets. They can earn money from interest-accumulating mtTokens while maintaining complete access to their funds. The platform maintains participant deposits within its pool network while giving different APY yield rates to depositors alongside loan functions for users who have assets as collateral. On the platform users obtain $5,000 USDT by depositing $7,000 ETH with an optimized security measure that controls the loan-to-collateral ratio. A smarter alternative to other coins Mutuum Finance maintains its financial operations in a stable long-term pattern. Investors select initiatives with long-term value because the presale operation completes swiftly. An opportunity to buy MUTM for $0.025 will soon cease to exist as specialists project that its market worth will increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a better alternative to Solana and other top-tier cryptos, offering early investors a rare chance at massive returns. With over $6.5 million raised, 8,100+ holders, and a Phase 4 token price of just $0.025, MUTM is gaining rapid traction. A projected price surge to $1.50 by the end of 2025 represents a staggering 5,900% increase, potentially turning a $500 investment into $30,000. As the token prepares to enter Phase 5 at $0.03, time is running out to secure tokens before the price jump. With a CertiK audit underway and a robust DeFi lending infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is built for long-term impact.

I still think that’s in play,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in an April 9 blog post. He suggested that the fallout from US President Donald Trump’s global tariff push could be beneficial for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto because his administration “wants a weaker dollar, even if it means ending its role as the world’s reserve currency.” Hougan cited an April 7 speech by Steve Miran, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which criticized the dollar’s reserve status as causing “persistent currency distortions” and “unsustainable trade deficits” that have “decimated” US manufacturing. Hougan said a weaker greenback could have both short-term and long-term implications for Bitcoin. In the short term, dollar weakness historically correlates with Bitcoin strength, he added, citing the US Dollar Index (DXY). “Dollar down equals Bitcoin up,” Hougan said. “I expect this pattern will continue.” BTC prices have generally been historically high when DXY has been historically low. Source: MacroMicro The DXY, which compares the value of the US dollar to a basket of six major currencies, has fallen more than 7% since the beginning of 2025, according to TradingView. In the long term, Hougan said disruption to the global reserve currency system creates opportunities for alternative reserve assets, including Bitcoin and gold. “Governments and companies turn to the dollar for international trade precisely because of its stability. When that stability comes into question, they have to look elsewhere.” The Bitwise executive concluded that the world will move from a single reserve currency to a “more fractured reserve system, with hard money like Bitcoin and gold playing a bigger role than it does today.” Earlier this week, VanEck said that China and Russia were reportedly settling some energy trades in Bitcoin as Trump’s trade war ramps up. On April 9, Trump issued a 90-day pause on nearly all of his earlier announced “reciprocal tariffs,” keeping a baseline 10% tariff on all countries besides China, which he lumped with a 125% tariff. Bitcoin will be the fastest horse Crypto trader and analyst Will Clemente said on X that “Bitcoin will be the fastest horse” coming out of this drawdown. Related: Most opportune time to buy Bitcoin? Now — Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan explains why “It’s a pure reflection of liquidity and no earnings, if anything, economic uncertainty/deglobalization are positive for Bitcoin,” he added. BTC is up 7.5% over the past 24 hours to $81,700. It has seen a correction of around 32% from its Jan. 20 all-time high, in line with pullbacks in previous bull market cycles.

In such situations, traders tend to ignore the noise and follow the tape – monitor the price chart, identify the path of least resistance and follow the same. In case of bitcoin (BTC), the tape has turned bullish, with short-duration price charts flashing a pattern opposite of the one that characterized the January-February price peak above $109K. We are talking about the double bottom pattern comprising two consecutive troughs with lows at about the same price, representing downtrend exhaustion, and a trendline drawn through the high point between the two troughs. A move above the trendline, also called the neckline, confirms a breakout and a bullish shift in the market trend. BTC put in a double bottom at around $74,600 between April 7 and April 9, separated by a temporary recovery (high point) to nearly $80,800. On Wednesday, prices rose past that neckline level, confirming the double-bottom breakout. Technical analysis theory suggests adding the gap between troughs and the neckline to the breakout point to gauge the potential upside move, which suggests scope for a BTC price rally to $87,000. As of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $82,000. Supporting the bull case is the appearance of a ""bullish outside day"" candle on the daily chart, suggesting a trend reversal higher. The candle gets its name from its distinctive shape, featuring a green body and wicks that entirely engulf the negative price action of the preceding day. This pattern indicates a strong effort by buyers to reassert control, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment in the market. These bullish signals risk invalidation in case of a renewed move below $75,000. XRP, DOGE recovery may have legs Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP and the leading memecoin by market value, DOGE, surged by 14.3% and 12.7% on Wednesday, respectively, as a renewed uptick in BTC encouraged risk-taking across the broader crypto market. Both cryptocurrencies formed bullish outside day candles, signaling the bulls' efforts to regain market control after an extended sell-off. The pattern suggests potential for continued gains in the short-term.",Markets|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|XRP|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 05:41:34

This includes big names like BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, and two from Grayscale — the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. What Just Happened? On Wednesday, the SEC announced an “accelerated approval” for Nasdaq ISE’s proposal to allow options trading on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF. Simultaneously, the SEC also approved a request from NYSE American to allow options trading for Bitwise and Grayscale’s Ethereum-based products. In simple terms, this means investors will soon be able to trade options like financial contracts that let you bet on price movements on these Ethereum ETFs, similar to what we already saw earlier with spot Bitcoin ETFs . Why It Matters The approval of options trading adds more flexibility and depth to the crypto investment world. Investors can now hedge their ETH positions or make strategic bets without having to directly buy or sell Ethereum. This move is expected to increase trading activity and make Ethereum ETFs even more appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wasn’t surprised by the approval, noting it was widely anticipated. Meanwhile, ETF Store President Nate Geraci said even more Ethereum-related products could be on the way, including creative strategies like covered-call ETH ETFs and buffered ETH ETFs. Ethereum Price Reacts ETH had been dropping over the past few days, falling close to $1,400. But following the SEC announcement, it bounced back sharply to around $1,650. It came after it formed a solid base around $1,380, ETH broke past a key bearish trend line and soared to $1,687 before cooling off slightly. It’s now holding steady above $1,550 and the 100-hourly moving average, showing strength. While the price is facing some resistance around $1,650–$1,680, bulls could make another push higher if momentum holds. The news clearly brought fresh optimism into the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today: Trump’s Tariff Pause Sends Bitcoin to $82K , What’s Next? Several issuers are also pushing for permission to stake Ethereum in their ETFs. If allowed, this would mean they could earn extra returns on their ETH and pass those gains onto investors. Seyffart noted that staking decisions could come soon, with key deadlines in May, August, and a final one in October. Hence, in short, Options trading makes Ethereum ETFs more attractive and accessible to a wider group of investors. If staking is allowed too, it could open a whole new income stream. All eyes are now on the SEC’s next moves as Ethereum’s role in traditional finance continues to grow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One such token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has set the crypto world abuzz. The project is currently priced at $0.025 per token in phase 4 of its presale. MUTM has already raised over $6.5 million and has attracted more than 8100 holders within days. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Analysts are predicting that MUTM could surge to $1 before even Dogecoin catches up, potentially skyrocketing to as much as $5 in just 72 days following its official launch.

Now, with renewed focus on early-stage assets, many are asking whether MAGACOINFINANCE could follow a similar trajectory and evolve into a serious contender for long-term appreciation. While major projects like Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink (LINK), and Hedera (HBAR) continue advancing the blockchain ecosystem, it’s the retail-led launch of MAGACOINFINANCE that’s generating attention for its clean structure, strong momentum, and massive upside potential.

The central bank recently decided to sharply slow down its balance sheet reduction, also known as quantitative tightening (QT), dropping Treasury runoff caps from $25 billion to $5 billion per month. While this move had broad support, the minutes show it wasn’t without internal pushback. Some policymakers, including Governor Christopher Waller, weren’t happy with the slowdown and preferred to stay on track with the original QT pace. We have posted the minutes from the #FOMC meeting held March 18-19, 2025: https://t.co/PgN9O5QmoS — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) April 9, 2025 Debt Ceiling Concerns Prompt Policy Shift The slowdown in QT was influenced heavily by ongoing uncertainty around the U.S. debt ceiling. A presentation from a New York Fed official highlighted that slowing the drawdown would act as a buffer, helping preserve liquidity during a period of constrained government borrowing. The Fed aimed to prevent a sharp drop in reserves that could follow a resolution to the debt ceiling situation. In the March 18–19 meeting, the central bank decided to reduce the Treasury runoff limit while maintaining the $35 billion cap on mortgage bond drawdowns. This approach gives the Fed flexibility to manage money market conditions while monitoring the broader economic impact of federal debt management. Fed Signals a Long-Term Shift in Strategy Fed Chair Jerome Powell and New York Fed President John Williams indicated that the reduced pace of QT could continue even after the debt ceiling issue is resolved. Powell emphasized that slowing QT extends the timeline before reserves become scarce, allowing the Fed to make decisions based on a clearer understanding of market conditions. Williams noted that a gradual approach helps avoid unnecessary disruptions and allows time to assess liquidity accurately. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today: Trump’s Tariff Pause Sends Bitcoin to $82K , Crypto Market Reacts Steadily The crypto market remained stable in response to the Fed’s move. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum showed minimal volatility as the decision signaled caution rather than concern. By slowing QT, the Fed is effectively keeping more liquidity in the system, which can be favorable for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies . Although the primary focus remains on the federal funds rate, the Fed’s approach to QT continues to influence broader market sentiment. Analysts now anticipate that QT could extend into next year, especially if financial conditions remain fragile amid global trade uncertainties and potential shifts in U.S. fiscal policy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The SEC needs to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws,” OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter to Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the agency’s Crypto Task Force . Faure and Brookover argued that NFT marketplaces don’t meet the legal definition of an exchange under US securities laws as they don’t execute transactions, act as intermediaries or bring together multiple sellers for the same asset. “The Commission’s past enforcement agenda has created uncertainty. We therefore urge the Commission to remove this uncertainty and protect the ability of US technology companies to lead in this space,” Faure and Brookover wrote. OpenSea’s legal team has asked the SEC to issue informal guidance on NFT Marketplaces. Source: SEC “In preparing this guidance, the Crypto Task Force should specifically address the application of exchange regulations to marketplaces for non-fungible assets, similar to the recent staff statements on memecoins and stablecoins,” Faure and Brookover added. Under a notice published on April 4, the SEC said stablecoins that meet specific criteria are considered “non-securities” and are exempt from transaction reporting requirements. Meanwhile, the SEC’s division of corporation finance said in a Feb. 27 staff statement that memecoins are not securities under the federal securities laws but are more akin to collectibles. NFT marketplaces don’t fit broker definition, says OpenSea Faure and Brookover argued the Crypto Task Force should also exempt NFT marketplaces like OpenSea from having to register as a broker, arguing they don’t give investment advice, execute transactions, or custody customer assets. “We ask the SEC to clear the existing industry confusion on this issue by publishing informal guidance. In the longer term, we invite the Commission to exempt NFT marketplaces like OpenSea from proposed broker regulation,” they said.

On April 9, the company file d a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC, outlining plans for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The fund will track the price of Dogecoin ( DOGE ) using the CF DOGE-Dollar US Settlement Price Index as its benchmark, with Coinbase Custody named as the proposed custodian. The ETF is designed as a passive investment vehicle, meaning it won’t use leverage or derivatives. Instead, it will hold actual Dogecoin and calculate its daily net asset value (NAV) based on the benchmark index. The Trust won’t actively trade DOGE, except during share creations and redemptions or to cover certain fees. Further, to strengthen outreach and community engagement, 21Shares has brought on House of Doge, the corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, to support the marketing, branding, and strategic positioning of the ETF within the broader Dogecoin ecosystem.

Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out a bearish verdict for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,710.66 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price dropped over the last 24 hours towards the support at $552.6. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; However, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,710.66 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB was trading near the psychological mark of $600, which it still continues to do so in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-10 06:10:33

However, this analyst uses Elliot Wave Analysis to predict how low XRP token could drop below $1 before hitting its next double-digit ATH target. XRP Price Prediction & Elliot Wave Analysis: Crash Below $1 Before $20 Target Poular crypto analyst XForced Global posted latest thoughts on XRP price action based on Elliot Wave analysis . The X post notes that the first wave is complete as the token rallied from $0.50 to $3.40. Wave 2 will see Ripple’s value drop down to a buy zone that extends from $1.70 to $1.0 . Due to the inherent volatility, there might be a drop below the $1 psychological level before Wave 3 kickstarts. In Elliot Wave Theory, the third wave is the longest wave, and XForced Global notes that XRP price could hit $20 . If XRP token achieves this ATH , its market cap at the current supply would 10x and hit $1.16 trillion . The fourth wave , according to the analyst, will trigger a correction to roughly $7 before embarking on the final wave that will most likely propel XRP price to $30 . It is unsure if the crypto token will achieve this valuation in the short term; assuming that every aspect of the project goes well, it could take a few years and potentially a decade for XRP to hit $20 or $30. While the long-term outlook for XRP price is extremely bullish and is unrealistic considering the current market conditions, let’s explore short-term XRP price prediction and analysis. XRP Price Analysis For Next Week Between December 3, 2024, and April 3, 2025, XRP price traded in a range, creating a value area extending from $2.11 to $2.60. This area is where 70% of the volume was traded in the past four months. As noted in a previous XRP prediction & analysis , acceptance above the range low of $2.11 could signal strength and potentially propel the price to $2.41 and $2.60 . While the first target is where the highest volume was traded in the past four months, the second target is the range high of the aforementioned value area. XRP/USDT 1-day Chart For the next week, investors can expect one of two things to happen. Acceptance into the value area could lead to a rally to retest targets at $2.41 or $2.60. Rejection at $2.11 could lead to an extended correction to $1.47 . Interestingly, the bearish scenario puts XRP price into the buy zone obtained the aforementioned Elliot Wave analysis . Conclusion: Factors That Could Affect XRP’s Directional Bias There are three key events that could impact XRP price moves. Bitcoin’s price outlook . If BTC shows strength, so will XRP and other altcoins. Macroeconomic outlook involving the Fed and policy changes it makes. If the Fed decides to cut interest rates, it could provide prompt a risk-on scenario that pushes stock markets and crypto markets higher. Such a development could see price catalyze an acceptance into the value area and revisit $2.60. US President Donald Trump’s trade war. If the trade war between China and USA cools off, it could allow the stock and crypto markets to flourish.

(MSTR) stock soared 24.76% to $296.86 following President Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China. The move sparked a broader rally in U.S.-listed stocks, with MSTR leading the pack. Investors poured in as easing trade tensions fueled optimism in both crypto and traditional markets. The Nasdaq jumped 10%, and the S&P 500 rose 8%. After-hours trading saw a slight dip, with MSTR settling at $292.00. April 10, 2025 05:58:26 UTC Trump Pauses Nvidia H20 Chip Ban After Mar-a-Lago Dinner The Trump administration has paused the planned export restrictions on Nvidia’s H20 AI chip to China following a Mar-a-Lago dinner attended by CEO Jensen Huang. The decision came after Nvidia pledged new U.S. investments. Previously expected curbs drew bipartisan pressure amid China’s AI advancements. Despite political opposition, regulatory delays and staff shortages slowed action. Analysts see the move as a win for China, still reliant on advanced U.S. chips. The White House and Nvidia declined to comment on this. April 10, 2025 05:48:55 UTC Bitcoin Holds Strong Amid Global Tensions: What Recent Dips Really Mean Bitcoin’s sharp 53% drop during China’s mining ban revealed how technological crackdowns can severely impact the market. In contrast, external economic pressures like Trump’s tariff war led to only a 28% correction, showing Bitcoin’s resilience to geopolitical tensions. The current dip is seen as healthy consolidation rather than a sign of crisis. This reflects a shift in sentiment—investors are now less shaken by global events.

In a dramatic turnaround, the broader crypto market experienced a significant relief rally yesterday, with the prices of most assets soaring to lofty heights. XRP was not left out in the latest surge, as it rose above the $2 territory. XRP Rebounds Above $2 The rebound comes days after XRP plunged to a multi-month low of $1.6401 on April 7 as ongoing tariff tensions escalated. This escalated tension prompted investors to retreat from risky assets, including crypto. Since the decline, XRP's initial attempts to recover above $2 were unsuccessful. However, yesterday, XRP finally succeeded in breaking past the $2 territory. This comes after XRP’s price surged 15.3% to hit a daily high of $2.08 on April 9. Only Reason Behind XRP's Surge Some enthusiasts have attributed XRP’s recent price gains to several factors, particularly the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road. However, the major reason behind the surge is an announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump. The president issued a statement yesterday that temporarily halted all ‘reciprocal’ tariffs for 90 days. This indicates that the U.S. issued a three-month pause on tariffs it initially imposed in response to other countries' tariffs. During this period, the U.S. will lower its reciprocal tariffs to 10%. However, the U.S. President excluded China from this benevolence. Instead, he raised China’s tariffs to 125%, noting that the increment was ‘based on the lack of respect the country has shown the world markets.’ Interestingly, major assets, including XRP, soared on the news. Bitcoin, which initially crashed to $74,400 on Monday amid the tariff tension, rebounded nicely to above $82,000.Meanwhile, XRP has retraced slightly to $2.03 in the hours leading up to press time. With its 24-hour gains at 12.4%, XRP remains down 3.35% in the past week and 5.06% in 30 days.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-04-10 06:17:27

Currently, XRP is trading at $1.7, reflecting a slight decrease of 20.21% from the last 24 hours. In parallel, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, is garnering attention for its potential explosive growth. The project is in phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $6.5 million with over 8100 investors already onboard. In phase 5 the price will jump 20% to $0.03. MUTM could hit $5 and be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Transforming DeFi lending with a hybrid model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive rewards and community incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. A strategic vision for sustainable growth Mutuum Finance created its tokenomics framework to promote sustainable value through proper management of liquidity and strategic partnerships and security features with anti-inflation measures. The basis for enduring token price appreciation comes from a controlled distribution process during the presale phase alongside proper management techniques. The payout system for token staking pumps out steady passive revenue which retains both investors’ commitment and protects token sustainability levels. The deflationary mechanisms function over time to reduce network supply which leads to increased scarcity thereby strengthening price growth potential for the long term. While Ripple (XRP) may reach $5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a faster path to explosive growth from under $0.05. With over $6.5 million raised and 8,100 investors onboard, Mutuum’s unique lending model and strong security measures position it for major gains. As the presale price rises in Phase 5, early investors could see significant returns. Join the presale now and capitalize on this exciting DeFi opportunity.

Known for his short-term trading predictions, il Capo says the scale of what’s coming requires a broader perspective. In a detailed message shared with his followers, the analyst noted that it was important to balance adaptability with strategic foresight. “If you are not mentally or strategically prepared, the scale of what could happen could really catch you off guard,” he warned. Revisiting macroeconomic trends that began during the COVID-19 pandemic, il Capo viewed the Fed’s multitrillion-dollar stimulus as a temporary fix that postpones rather than prevents a larger crash. He sees it as an artificial rally driven by excess liquidity, ETFs, and stablecoin printing as markets, including BTC, reach new highs. “Interest rates are now starting to fall,” he noted, adding: “Historically, that would indicate a recession.” He suggests the world is heading toward a full-scale economic reset akin to the Great Depression of 1929, with the potential for a dramatic shift toward a digital financial system, including widespread adoption of central bank digital currencies and the ISO 20022 infrastructure. Il Capo predicts that this transformation could begin to occur between late 2025 and early 2026, echoing what some have called the Great Reset. Although markets have recently recovered after a 90-day halt to tariffs, il Capo sees it as short-term relief. Citing billionaire investor Ray Dalio, he argues that tariffs are “a distraction from what really matters.” il Capo listed his predictions about the market as follows: Very Short Term (Next Few Days) BTC could rise to the $92,000-$98,000 range. Altcoins may see a 50%-100% recovery. The market is responding positively to the customs duty postponement. Short Term (Next Few Weeks) Resistance can lead to capitulation. Possible triggers: new tariffs, escalation of conflict or health concerns. Flexibility and rapid response will be key. Medium Term (until September 2025) The upward trend is expected to continue. There is potential for an altseason, but it is milder than 2021 or 2017. Overly bearish outlooks could miss out on strong accumulation opportunities. Black swan events can develop long-term value zones. Long Term (end of 2025 to 2026) Signals indicate that a major downturn is imminent. BTC’s rally is seen as artificial and altcoins are lagging dangerously behind. September 2025 has been identified as a potential cyclical reversal, likened to the November 2021 peak. A true global crisis could unleash extreme volatility, testing BTC’s resilience like never before. “We have never seen Bitcoin behave like this during a real depression,” he warned, adding: “If that happens, expect the worst part of the cycle.” Despite the gloomy weather, il Capo encourages his followers to remain vigilant but open to opportunities. The coming months could still offer favorable conditions for selective gains, especially as markets remain oversold across many sectors. *This is not investment advice.

The memecoin, which is associated with First Lady Melania Trump , has failed to gain significant traction akin to the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin . Moreover, the latter has maintained a market cap and a fully diluted valuation of above $1 billion after launch, but MELANIA’s keeps on declining. As of this writing, MELANIA had an FDV of about $515 million and a reported 24-hour average trading volume of around $22.77 million. MELANIA Whales Keeps Dumping The MELANIA meme project has heavily been criticized for its low community engagement after its hyped launch. In the past few months, on-chain data shows early adopters of MELANIA have been dumping, thus weighing down on bullish recovery. Source : lookonchain X Post According to on-chain data analysis from Lookonchain, the MELANIA team has been offloading their holdings through tampering with the liquidity pools. Precisely, the MELANIA token team sold 6.72 million tokens for 34,168 Solana (SOL) coins, during the last 25 days. Lookonchain noted that the MELANIA team has been adding and removing liquidity across 8 wallets in the recent past. Midterm Market Expectations Following the strategic move by the Donald Trump administration to pause reciprocal tariffs , with the exception of China, for 90 days, the wider crypto market has signaled bullish sentiment akin to the stock markets. Moreover, Trump posted on TruthSocial that more great days are coming after Wednesday’s moves. As a result, the MELANIA price, in the 1-hour timeframe, has formed a potential reversal pattern, characterized by an inverted head and shoulder pattern coupled with a bullish divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

Bitcoin rose over 7% as it regained its $80K levels while the broader crypto market followed suit. XRP and Ether were the top gainers among major crypto tokens with an impressive 12% surge while Cardano, BNB, SOL and DOGE witnessed gains as much as 10%. The overall market cap also rose to 6%. Markets Recover Earlier Losses Crypto futures saw over $350 million in short liquidations, which helped the market recover some losses from earlier this week when Bitcoin dipped to $75,000. Such liquidations can be a buying opportunity which signals that market is now settling back to fair levels. This rally comes after Trump paused steeper tariffs on all countries except China which eased global tensions and recession fears. In a Truth Social post , Trump declared that he had “ authorized a 90-day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately .” Besides the tariff on China would rise to 125% once the pause ends. Notably, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that the tariff pause was always part of the strategy to push the countries into negotitations. But Trump changed his stance just a day after new tariffs hit, as markets crashed wiping out trillions in value and U.S. bond yields spiked, which might have prompted this. Biggest Surge In US Stock Notably, this move triggered the biggest surge in US stock since 2008, with the S&P 500 jumping 9.5% and the Nasdaq rose 12%, lifting markets out of the slump. This move could be a temporary measure to ease the market pressures without giving up leverage, which provides businesses a short term sense of stability. Experts believe that markets are rising in expectations of trade deals with the US in an effort to avoid a full-blown trade war. The ongoing US-China tariffs could drastically change the global trade in a big way and the after-effects will unfold in the coming months. Negotiations Bring Some Hope Notably, Jupiter Zheng of HashKey Capital believes the market may have hit a local bottom. The recent upswing might be fueled by the optimism that the worst has already passed. While risks like China’s potential retaliation to Trump’s 125% tariffs still loom, the negotiations with other countries bring some hope. Besides, he also pointed towards the favourable US crypto regulations signalling that Bitcoin and other cryptos might have already hit their lows. Market may not have fully priced in these positive developments which suggests that there could still be room for growth, unless no shocks emerge. How did trump’s sudden move affect the overall crypto market? The news led to a 7% surge in Bitcoin back to $82K and lifted the entire crypto market. Coins like ETH, ADA, BNB, and SOL gained around 10%, and total crypto market cap rose by 6%. What exactly did Trump announce about tariffs? Trump announced a 90-day pause on steep tariffs for all countries except China. During this time, a reduced reciprocal tariff rate of 10% would apply.

US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% Wednesday after Beijing announced a 50% duty increase on US goods, causing the onshore yuan to tumble to lows seen last in 2007. Beijing’s countermeasure, an 84% blanket tariff on US goods, took effect on Thursday and immediately shook currency markets. The Chinese yuan fell to its weakest level in more than 18 years. BREAKING: China's retaliatory 84% tariffs on US imports have gone into effect — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) April 10, 2025 The onshore yuan closed domestic trading at 7.3498 per USD, the lowest since December 2007, while the offshore yuan hovered around 7.36. The rapid depreciation followed two consecutive months of deflation in China, with March consumer prices dropping 0.1% year-on-year. February had seen a steeper 0.7% fall, adding to the government’s list of problems that include weakening domestic demand in the face of trade headwinds. Capital market jitters prompt emergency measures According to sources familiar with the matter, cited by Cryptopolitan, top Chinese officials convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss policy changes to prop up the economy. Beijing is expected to roll out additional fiscal support to counteract the damage caused by reduced trade volumes. In tandem, the People’s Bank of China set the midpoint rate, the benchmark from which the onshore yuan can trade within a 2% band, at 7.2066 per dollar, the lowest since September 2023. That allowed for a lower floor of 7.3507, just above the previous low seen last year. Still, both onshore and offshore yuan values have fallen more than 1% in April. Market observers saw the central bank’s stronger-than-expected midpoint fixing as a sign that authorities do not want a sharp yuan depreciation, even in a trade standoff with the US. On other currencies, the US dollar dropped 0.7% to 146.68 yen and lost 0.62% against the Swiss franc, trading at 0.8522. The euro rose 0.32% to $1.0985. The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for Chinese economic health, saw sharp swings. It initially slipped 0.33% to $0.6132 and had fallen as much as 0.5% earlier in the day. However, by Thursday morning, the Aussie rebounded by 3.3% after briefly touching a five-year low at $0.5910. Breaking a multi-billion trade deficit In 2024, the total value of goods traded between the two countries reached $688.28 billion, according to United Nations data. This figure is 275 times higher than the level in 1979, when diplomatic ties were first established, and over eight times larger than in 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization. China is still the United States’ second-largest source of imports and third-largest export destination. US goods exports to China accounted for 7% of total US exports in 2024, while imports from China made up 13.8% of total imports. On the flip side, China sent 14.7% of its total exports to the US and sourced 6.3% of its imports from it. Analysts say the practical effect of tariffs may be limited because China imports approximately $160 billion worth of goods from the US annually and exports over $400 billion. “ I don’t think they can match economically ,” said Rick Waters, director of the Carnegie China think tank in Singapore. “ So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price .” China could also direct its anger to America’s services sector, where the North holds a relative advantage. Washington consistently records a surplus of services with China in finance, law, and consulting. A report by China’s State Council released Wednesday identified China as the US’s fifth-largest service export market. Beijing could respond by restricting US companies from participating in government procurement or limiting their cooperation with Chinese firms to tighten the screws on American service providers operating in China. China commission to sue the US China’s Customs Tariff Commission believes Trump is making a “mistake upon another mistake” by adding a 125% levy on the Asian country and pausing duties on other jurisdictions. In a statement released Wednesday, the Commission urged America to resolve disputes through “equal dialogue based on mutual respect.” Beijing also filed a new complaint with the World Trade Organization, accusing the United States of “bullying China.” “ We believe Beijing views these US trade actions as nothing short of a declaration of economic war ,” Analysts from BCA Research said in a note to clients. “ Chinese authorities will allow the yuan to depreciate materially. The US-China confrontation is set to escalate from here. ” “ It seems likely that the US President blinked when confronted with a potential recession, a political backlash, a near equity bear market, and the early warning signs of a financial crisis ,” said Kyle Rodda, an analyst at Capital.com. “ Even if President Trump does cut deals with trading partners ,” Rodda added, “ there’s harm that’s been done to the markets and the US economy that will take time to heal from .” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Claver outlined the significance of the acquisition, emphasizing its implications for institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , as well as for the broader use of XRP and Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. According to Claver, this acquisition marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Ripple’s ecosystem, particularly in how it addresses institutional finance. Ripple just dropped $1.25 BILLION to buy Hidden Road, a prime brokerage that moves $3 trillion annually. But why should XRP holders care? Because it's about to change everything for #XRP and #RLUSD . Let’s talk about why. 1/19 pic.twitter.com/wLPFNADyn6 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) April 8, 2025 Institutional Scale Meets On-Chain Settlement Claver highlighted that Hidden Road serves over 300 institutional clients, with $10 billion in daily trading activity. These trades will now have the option to be settled directly on the XRP Ledger. As Claver pointed out, this is not retail volume—it is institutional capital handled by hedge funds and market makers. With a portion of this $10 billion in daily trades potentially settling through XRP, demand for the asset is positioned to rise significantly. Each transaction on the XRP Ledger requires XRP, and institutions operating at this scale will require large quantities to support settlement operations. Ripple’s acquisition also directly connects traditional financial operations to the benefits of blockchain. Hidden Road’s decision to integrate RLUSD as collateral across all its prime brokerage products represents the first stablecoin enabling cross-margining between digital and traditional markets. According to Claver, this effectively creates an interoperable financial system underpinned by digital assets, offering instant settlement through XRP and stable collateral via RLUSD. Solving Longstanding Industry Pain Points Claver stated that the move addresses several key concerns from institutional players, including regulatory compliance, settlement risk, and capital inefficiency. Ripple’s existing portfolio of over 60 licenses, combined with XRPL’s settlement speed , offers a solution to these barriers. The instant finality of transactions on XRPL contrasts sharply with the 24-hour-plus settlement cycles typical in traditional markets. This shift could significantly alter how institutions handle post-trade operations, particularly in terms of speed, cost, and risk mitigation. According to Claver, Trust is a major factor. Hidden Road’s institutional clients rely on the firm for large-scale financial operations. With Ripple now owning that infrastructure, these same clients will gain exposure to and potentially build trust in XRP and RLUSD as integrated components of the financial workflows they already utilize. Economic Efficiency and Market Expansion Another critical element in Claver’s analysis is cost savings. Settling through XRPL reduces operational expenses for financial institutions. Hidden Road, now backed by Ripple, can pass these savings to clients, increasing its competitiveness. This economic advantage will likely encourage greater adoption and higher transaction volumes, reinforcing demand for XRP and RLUSD. The acquisition also opens new use cases. XRP can facilitate r eal-time cross-border settlements , while RLUSD provides a reliable instrument for liquidity management and hedging. These functionalities expand what financial institutions can accomplish within the Ripple ecosystem. As institutions engage with XRP and RLUSD more frequently, liquidity improves, volatility decreases, and the assets become more attractive for further integration. Positioning at the Intersection of TradFi and DeFi Claver emphasized the strategic nature of the acquisition. By purchasing Hidden Road, Ripple is no longer waiting for institutions to adopt its technology—it now owns a platform already processing more financial volume daily than most blockchains do in an entire month. With that infrastructure under its control, Ripple can directly plug XRPL and RLUSD into the operations of major financial firms. This removes adoption friction and expands Ripple’s institutional reach in one move. Ripple is now positioned to offer a comprehensive end-to-end financial solution: from trade execution and collateralization to instant settlement, all within the same ecosystem. Claver described this as a fundamental shift in how XRP and RLUSD are perceived and used in global finance. A Signal of Long-Term Commitment Concluding his analysis, Claver remarked that the $1.25 billion investment sends a clear signal of Ripple’s confidence in XRP and RLUSD as essential components of future finance. Every transaction processed through XRPL increases the demand for XRP. Every client using RLUSD for collateral enhances the stablecoin’s utility. This ecosystem, as Claver explained, is no longer theoretical—it is being actively built and deployed. In Claver’s view, skeptics of XRP’s institutional potential now face a new reality. Ripple owns a pipeline moving $3 trillion annually. The pipeline is being redirected through the XRPL. With infrastructure, regulatory licenses, and institutional relationships now under its umbrella, Ripple is establishing a new standard for digital asset integration in global financial markets.

The crypto market still struggles to recover from the trade war. More importantly, the fear is building as Donald Trump has increased the tariff on China to 125%. In contrast, China has implemented an 85% tariff on US imports, intensifying the US-China trade war situation. In this turmoil, the cryptos could face further uncertainty and even collapse. Top 4 Altcoins to Sell Amid US-China Trade War The US-China tariff trade war has become one of the most bearish factors for the crypto market. All the digital assets, including Bitcoin, are struggling with extreme whale movements and downtrends. More importantly, the recovery is vague, so consider FTX Token (FTT), Toncoin (TON), Shiba Inu, Pi Coin, and a few other altcoins to sell. 1. FTX Token (FTT) FTT faced a massive downtrend with the collapse of the FTX exchange. More importantly, its recovery from the drop is still vague, with the prime being 98.93% away from current levels. Now, the risk is building as Binance’s ‘vote to delist’ includes this struggling altcoin. If that happens, the token may face a further downtrend. 2. Toncoin (TON) In early 2024, TON was among the best-performing cryptos , but that changed with the regulatory issues with Telegram and Pavel Durov. As a result, it crashed and has been under consolidation ever since, making it among the top choices for altcoins to sell. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu is known as the second biggest and top meme coin but is under scrutiny due to the declining demand for these meme-themed cryptos. Experts believe that these cryptos may never make a complete recovery from their drops as they lack utility and trend and face high competition. At present, the SHIB price is on the recovery trail but may crash amid the US-China trade war, making it the right time to sell along with other struggling cryptos. 4. Pi Coin (PI) Pi Coin is often a topic of discussion, as the crypto community is split between calling it the scam coin and the profitable coin. Since its launch, it has witnessed a significant uptrend, gaining investors’ attention, but the downfalls were also persistent. With regulatory concerns and Binance’s pending listing, its credibility is low. Bottom Line The recent crypto market crash has been in constant turmoil for weeks, losing billions in liquidations. Many digital assets have lost all the gains they made during the Trump presidency-influenced bull run, and if the US-China trade war continues, the loss can extend. As a result, investors must consider struggling altcoins like FTT, Shiba Inu, and others to sell.

According to CoinGecko, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) shot up by 43.5%, hitting a 10-week high market cap of $731 million. Popcat ( POPCAT ), Ket (KET), and Mog Coin ( MOG ) weren’t far behind, jumping 28.6%, 26.2%, and 24.1%, respectively. Even the bigger names like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) saw a boost—DOGE went up 9.5%, SHIB gained 10.5%, and PEPE climbed 9.5%. Overall, the memecoin market surged 10.6% in the last 24 hours, bringing the total market cap to $46.8 billion. The rally kicked off after Trump announced on April 9 via Truth Social that he was pausing his recently announced aggressive tariff policies for 90 days. He’s also temporarily lowered the reciprocal tariff to 10% while trade talks continue.

Despite yesterday’s pause, tariffs on Chinese imports did go up to 125%, adding more tension between the U.S. and China. That said, China’s Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, said they’re open to resolving things through negotiations, which gave investors some relief. This has brought relief to investors who have taken a risk-on sentiment as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index went up ten points to 25. Memecoins rallied alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ), which has continued to act as the dominant market force with a 62.6% market share as it climbed past $83,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ), the largest altcoin, climbed back above $1,600. The total crypto market cap recovered 5% to $2.68 trillion in the same period. Still, with Bitcoin dominance holding strong, most analysts agree that a true altcoin season, where capital rotates into altcoins and memecoins see sustained, independent rallies, won’t begin until BTC starts to lose its grip .

Analysts point to fading social media hype — and a glaring lack of real-world utility — as reasons for the memecoin’s freefall, which also revealed its vulnerability to sudden sell-offs. As Phase 4 of the sale progresses at $0.025 per token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still attracting capital, and its presales have passed $6.5 million. As Phase 5 is set to increase prices by 20%, investors are focusing on projects that bring innovation together with real financial structures. Pepe’s Downward Spiral Pepe’s fall exposes deeper structural fissures. Riding initially high on meme-driven ambitions, the token now struggles with cooling community interest and vague development aims. Whaled out quickly, skeptical of its speculative underpinning and lack of problem-solving use cases. Pepe lacks the lending or yield mechanisms that decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are built on, and instead depends entirely on cultural significance — a plan experts label as “economically unsustainable.” PEPE has been trending downward since the recent peak in 2025 and as such, it is struggling to hold down on its recent trading charts showing PEPE down 64% down from its recent peak in 2025. Analysts say recovery is unlikely unless ecosystems are upgraded immediately. “Tokens based only on virality tend to never recover,” says a veteran crypto strategist. “Investors are now focused on protocols that offer utility, not just internet fads.” This echoes across exchanges, with PEPE’s trading volume left to die alongside its price. The Presale Momentum of Mutuum Finance Instead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking advantage of DeFi’s move toward functional ecosystems. Over 8,100 holders have already signed up for the presale ($0.025) with 395 million tokens sold. The lending infrastructure of the project—allowing for collateralized loans and passive income through mtTokens—appeals to investors looking for stability. Phase 5 raises the token price to $0.03, which would give current buyers an immediate 20% profit. Mutuum Finance has a $0.06 listing target, which means that early participants can lock away as much as 140% returns at launch. After the initial onslaught of buying, MUTM looks to fly, some very early estimations range up towards $1.50 and $3.50 as platform use takes off. These percentages mean possible 2,300% to 5,900% ROI for those coming in Phase 4, far outstripping typical market returns. Built-In Demand Drivers The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance engineer perpetual buy pressure. A portion of platform fees are paid out for automatic MUTM buybacks which redistribute tokens to mtToken stakers. This mechanism reduces supply and encourages long-term holding — directly opposed to memecoins’ volatility. Also its overcollateralized lending model minimizes default risks, which is a siren song to institutional players eyeing growth of DeFi. Security is a priority with Mutuum Finance completing a Certik audit to invalidate the authenticity of the smart contract. Official channels are slated to announce results, due any time now—undoubtedly building confidence in traders. Timing the Opportunity The window for Phase 4 of the Mutuum Finance project is closing. The entry point of $0.025 — some 20% below where it will enter its next phase — is the last low-cost opportunities before exchange listings. Historical data has shown that presale tokens usually skyrocket after launch, especially ones that come with audited contracts and buy pressure mechanics. As Pepe’s community scrambles for the exits, meet Mutuum Finance (MUTM): the new DeFi blueprint for sustainable growth. The combination of lending utility, utilities from strategic token burns, and transparent roadmaps means it is set not only to survive, but thrive in 2025’s changing landscape. Become one of 8,100+ investors leveraging Mutuum Finance’s Phase 4 presale. Buy at $0.025 for MUTM before Phase 5 which will lift the price to $0.03. Get in now at the official website.

The last three hours of trading proved pivotal, as stocks responded sharply to Trump’s Truth Social post outlining his decision to delay the enforcement of “reciprocal tariffs” and instead impose a uniform 10% tariff—excluding China, which now faces a hefty 125% rate due to its retaliatory trade policies. Among the biggest beneficiaries was Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), which closed the day up 24.76% at $296.86. Coinbase (COIN), one of the leading crypto exchanges, followed closely with a 17% surge, ending at $177.09. The rally extended to miners as well, with Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) jumping 17%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) adding 16.59%, and Riot Platforms (RIOT) climbing 12.77%. The broader US stock market rallied in tandem. The S&P 500 posted a stunning 9.52% gain—its third-largest single-day jump since the Second World War. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outpaced it, ending the session with a 12.02% increase. Crypto Joins the Global Recovery The impact of the tariff pause wasn’t limited to equities. Bitcoin also staged a notable rebound , rising 7.52% over the past 24 hours to trade at $82,065, according to CoinMarketCap. The turnaround comes after weeks of uncertainty sparked by Trump’s earlier tariff threats, which in February dragged Bitcoin below the $100,000 mark. The most damaging blow came on April 4, when a more aggressive executive order tanked U.S. markets by $3.25 trillion—surpassing the entire crypto market cap at the time. That two-day stretch left investors rattled. However, the latest pivot from the White House appears to have tempered fears for now, restoring optimism in both traditional and digital markets. Asia Pacific Opens Strong Ripple effects from the U.S. surge have already begun to show in the Asia-Pacific region. As markets opened on April 10, Australia’s ASX 200 was up 4.55%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped nearly 10%. This global relief rally suggests that investors are breathing easier—for now—thanks to Trump’s softened tone and the cooling of what many feared could become a full-scale trade war.

Sustainable tokenomics for long-term growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term.

43159403,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148158,1744270512,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: OpenSea Demands SEC Clarity on NFT Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/opensea-demands-sec-nft-regulation/,"Navigating the burgeoning world of NFTs can feel like charting unknown waters, especially when it comes to regulation. Leading NFT marketplace OpenSea is now at the forefront, urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide much-needed clarity. This move could redefine how NFT marketplaces operate and impact the future of digital asset trading. Let’s dive into why OpenSea is making this urgent plea and what it means for the crypto community. The Core Issue: Defining NFT Marketplaces Under Existing Regulations At the heart of OpenSea’s request is a fundamental question: How should NFT marketplaces be classified under current securities laws? In a detailed letter addressed to Hester Peirce, a key figure in the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force, OpenSea articulated its position. They argue that existing regulations, specifically the Exchange Act, don’t neatly apply to NFT marketplaces due to the unique nature of NFT transactions. Here’s a breakdown of OpenSea’s main arguments: Decentralized Transactions: OpenSea emphasizes that NFT transactions are executed via immutable smart contracts. This means the platform doesn’t operate in the same way as traditional exchanges with “multiple sellers” actively managed by a central entity. No Investment Solicitation: OpenSea asserts it doesn’t solicit investments or act as an agent guiding users towards specific investment opportunities. It provides a platform for users to interact directly through self-executing code. Not Broker-Dealers: Based on the above points, OpenSea contends that it shouldn’t be classified as an exchange or broker-dealer under securities laws. They are seeking explicit confirmation from the SEC on this interpretation. This isn’t just about semantics; it’s about establishing a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting users. The current ambiguity leaves NFT marketplaces in a legal grey area, potentially stifling growth and creating uncertainty for participants. Why is SEC Clarity on NFT Regulation So Crucial? The SEC’s stance on NFT regulation carries significant weight. Clarity in this area is not just beneficial for platforms like OpenSea but for the entire NFT ecosystem. Let’s explore why this regulatory clarity is so vital: Encourages Innovation: Clear rules of the game allow for sustainable innovation. When NFT marketplaces understand the regulatory boundaries, they can confidently develop new features and services without fear of unexpected legal repercussions. Attracts Institutional Investment: Institutional investors often shy away from markets with regulatory uncertainty. Clear cryptocurrency regulation , specifically for NFTs, can pave the way for larger institutional participation, bringing more capital and stability to the NFT space. Protects Users: Appropriate regulation, when clearly defined, is essential for user protection. It can help establish standards for transparency, security, and fair practices within NFT marketplaces . Global Market Harmonization: SEC guidance can influence global regulatory approaches. Clarity in the US market, a significant player in the crypto world, can set a precedent for other jurisdictions, fostering a more harmonized global NFT regulation landscape. OpenSea’s Perspective: More Than Just a Marketplace? OpenSea’s argument hinges on its interpretation of its role in the NFT ecosystem. They position themselves as a technology provider, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions rather than operating as a traditional financial intermediary. Let’s delve deeper into OpenSea ’s operational model and their claims: Feature OpenSea’s Claim Traditional Exchange Model Transaction Processing Via immutable smart contracts Centralized order book and matching engine Seller Interaction Platform provider, not direct seller Directly facilitates and manages seller activities Investment Advice Does not provide investment advice May offer investment products or recommendations Role Technology platform Financial intermediary, potentially broker-dealer or exchange By highlighting these distinctions, OpenSea aims to differentiate itself from entities traditionally regulated by the SEC. Their argument is that applying securities laws designed for conventional exchanges to decentralized NFT marketplaces like theirs is a regulatory mismatch. The SEC Investigation and What’s Next for NFT Marketplaces It’s noteworthy that the SEC previously conducted an investigation into OpenSea, which was closed in February. While the details of this investigation remain undisclosed, its closure could be interpreted as a positive sign for OpenSea. However, the broader question of cryptocurrency regulation , particularly for NFTs, remains open. Looking ahead, several potential scenarios could unfold: SEC Provides Explicit Guidance: The SEC could issue formal guidance clarifying how existing securities laws apply to NFT marketplaces. This is what OpenSea is hoping for and would bring much-needed certainty. New Regulatory Framework: Recognizing the unique nature of NFTs, the SEC might develop a new regulatory framework specifically tailored for digital assets. This could involve creating new categories and rules that address the specific characteristics of NFT marketplaces . Continued Ambiguity: The SEC might choose to maintain the current level of ambiguity, potentially taking enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis. This scenario would likely prolong uncertainty and could stifle innovation. Legislative Action: Ultimately, comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation , including for NFTs, might require legislative action from Congress to create a clear and modern legal framework. Actionable Insights: Navigating the NFT Regulatory Landscape For those involved in the NFT space—creators, collectors, marketplaces, and investors—understanding the evolving regulatory landscape is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments from the SEC and other relevant bodies. Follow industry news and legal analyses to understand potential changes in NFT regulation . Engage in Dialogue: Participate in industry discussions and forums focused on regulatory issues. Contributing to the conversation can help shape future policies. Seek Legal Counsel: If you are operating an NFT marketplace or involved in significant NFT activities, consult with legal professionals specializing in cryptocurrency and securities law to ensure compliance and mitigate risks. Advocate for Clarity: Support industry initiatives that advocate for clear and sensible cryptocurrency regulation . Clarity benefits all stakeholders in the long run. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for NFT Regulation OpenSea’s urgent call for SEC clarity marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of NFT regulation . The outcome of this dialogue will not only shape the future of OpenSea but also the broader NFT ecosystem. As the digital asset space continues to mature, establishing a clear and balanced regulatory framework is essential to unlock its full potential while safeguarding users and fostering sustainable growth.

The 11 bitcoin ETFs lost a net $127.2 million Wednesday, with investors withdrawing $89.7 million from BlackRock's IBIT alone, according to data from Farside Investors. Wednesday marked the fifth consecutive day of outflows, with the funds losing a cumulative $722 million over the period. Ether ETFs have also fallen out of investor favor and the nine funds saw a net outflow of $11.2 million Wednesday. The dwindling demand can be attributed to the macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China trade tensions and volatility in the bond markets that likely led to macro investors selling every asset, including crypto ETFs, for cash. Markets bounced back sharply later Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for more than 75 nations that did not retaliate to his sweeping duties announced a week ago. However, China, which recently placed steeped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, did not get any relief, as Trump hiked the total levy on Chinese goods to 125%.

On-chain analysts predict more community tokens will be sold by the team. According to Lookonchain , the MELANIA ( MELANIA ) team has been adding and removing liquidity across eight different wallets. Within the past month, the team has swapped 6.72 million tokens for 34,168 SOL ( SOL ), earning them profit of $4.2 million in total. On-chain sleuths believe that this is part of an even broader attempt to off-load more tokens from the project’s community funds. On-chain analysis from Bubblemaps shows that the team behind the First Lady’s meme coin has been selling off the community’s tokens over the past few months. Only a week ago, the team offloaded $2 million worth of tokens from community funds in a single-sided liquidity sale. Bubblemaps alleged that the team has been quietly selling a huge chunk of its tokens without any clear explanation. “Huge sell-offs on $MELANIA $30M was moved from community funds — and is now being quietly sold, with no explanation from the team,” wrote the account in a recent post .

Among those addresses, two wallets opened up new positions on-chain worth $6 million each. Not only that, another wallet also sent $3 million worth of crypto funds to exchanges and $500,000 worth of tokens were sold off. 1/ Huge sell-offs on $MELANIA $30M was moved from community funds — and is now being quietly sold, with no explanation from the team 🧵 pic.twitter.com/UbhAqiiW61 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) April 7, 2025 This surge of on-chain activity from team wallets has led the analytics platform to believe the team has plans to off-load more tokens.

The Cardano founder indicated he believes adoption by major technology companies and clearer regulations will drive the next wave of growth in the cryptocurrency market. Speaking to CNBC during the “Beyond the Valley” podcast, Hoskinson said investors are likely to adjust to the current macroeconomic environment, including rising geopolitical tensions and shifts in US trade policy. He added that once markets stabilize and the US Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, capital would start flowing back into digital assets. “The markets will stabilize a little bit, and they’ll get used to the new normal, and then the Fed will lower interest rates, and then you’ll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it’ll pour into crypto,” he said. Bitcoin to hit $250,000 this year and Magnificent 7 to adopt stablecoins, Cardano founder predicts https://t.co/OoHgwxRH4m — CNBC (@CNBC) April 10, 2025 Hoskinson Remains Bullish Despite Volatility and Sharp Market Swings Hoskinson made the comments before US President Donald Trump announced a temporary pause on a new round of global tariffs . The move came after days of volatility in equity and crypto markets. Bitcoin dropped below US$77,000 earlier in the week but rebounded above $82,000 following the pause . Despite the recovery, the assets remains well below its record high above $100,000 in January. Hoskinson, who also helped launch Ethereum and now leads Input Output, pointed to several reasons for his bullish view. This includes the growing number of cryptocurrency users around the world. Data from Crypto.com shows ownership was up 13% year on year in 2024 to 659m. Hoskinson Predicts Big Tech Will Turn to Stablecoins for Global Payments He also argued that global instability is pushing countries away from traditional systems and making decentralised options more attractive. “If Russia wants to invade Ukraine, it invades Ukraine. If China wants to invade Taiwan, it’s going to do that. So treaties don’t really work so well, and global business doesn’t really work so well there. So your only option for globalisation is crypto,” Hoskinson said. Legislative efforts in the US could also play a key role. Hoskinson expects new bills on stablecoins and digital asset market structure to pass in the coming months. These laws could provide clarity for investors and open the door for mainstream adoption. Hoskinson believes that the largest technology companies may soon explore stablecoin integration. The so-called Magnificent 7, which includes Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, could use blockchain-based tokens for cross-border payments or microtransactions. He said this would reduce costs and increase efficiency. While he expects the crypto market to remain quiet for the next few months, Hoskinson sees a turning point later this year. He predicted a new wave of investor interest starting around August or September that could continue into 2026.

In the days leading up to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on April 10, crypto investors have moved a huge amount of Bitcoin over 22,000 BTC worth $1.82 billion into Binance. According to CryptoQuant’s Maarten Regterschot, this sharp increase hints at investors repositioning due to macro uncertainty, particularly surrounding Donald Trump’s tariff policy and the inflation outlook. Why Are People Moving Their BTC to Binance? This spike in inflows often triggers alarm bells, as traders typically move crypto onto exchanges when they’re preparing to sell. With Bitcoin recently bouncing up 8.8% to around $82,474 after Trump’s 90-day pause on new tariffs (excluding China), some fear the market could be heading for a pullback. On the flip side, Swyftx analyst Pav Hundal notes this might not be bearish at all. He says the movement could simply reflect Binance preparing for higher trading volume rather than an incoming sell-off. Trump’s Tariff Pause Eases Pressure—For Now On April 9, Trump temporarily eased tensions by pausing his “reciprocal tariffs” policy, keeping tariffs at 10% for most countries but bumping China’s rate to 125%. While the move provided short-term relief and boosted Bitcoin’s price , the unresolved trade dispute between the U.S. and China still casts a long shadow over the market. Hundal warns that lingering geopolitical stress could continue to unsettle risk assets like crypto. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ​SEC Approves Options Trading for Spot Ethereum ETFs: A Game-Changer for Crypto Investors​ , All Eyes on CPI Data Market sentiment now hinges on inflation numbers. Some analysts, like Matthew Hyland, believe the March CPI could show a dramatic drop, possibly near 2.5%, which might fuel a Bitcoin rally. Another analyst, Dyme, expects BTC to rise if the CPI comes in lower than forecast. However, FactSet data suggests a more modest view, with economists predicting just a 0.1% monthly increase. As Bitcoin pours into Binance, the crypto market is at a critical juncture. Whether this is a sign of incoming profit-taking or a bullish reshuffle ahead of CPI data remains to be seen. One thing’s for sure: macro moves are once again setting the tone for Bitcoin’s next chapter. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These 3 Altcoins Could Make You Millions in 100 Days,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/time-to-enter-the-market-these-3-altcoins-could-make-you-millions-in-100-days-2/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano are among the most popular altcoins in the markets right now and they are back to gaining the value they lost in the market crash of Monday. Black Monday, as it’s being called, saw crypto as well as other markets crash badly on rising concerns about geopolitical situations, the escalating tariff war, and fears of a recession. However, while these concerns are valid, crypto saw billions of dollars in the form of longs and shorts being liquidated. The values of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano dropped significantly, along with most other cryptos. Smart investors are moving in now to pick up their choice of altcoins for future growth at their current dips to book good bargains. Many investors are picking up IntelMarkets along with Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to build a strong growth portfolio for the next quarter. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Recovering As Bargain Buyers Boost Demand In the aftermath of Monday’s crash, the crypto market is getting substantial support from whales and bargain hunters as they help boost the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost over 17% in value between April 6 and 7 as it dropped from $0.000012 to $0.000010. However, the recovery started on late Monday as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) regained about 9% value as it touched $0.000011. Current trading in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) charts is creating a rising trend as the price gained and then lost approximately 5% value. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000011 as community sentiment remains bullish, and bulls remain in control of the narrative. Cardano Regains 10% Value As Markets Recover The Cardano price chart shows a recovery trend over the past 24 hours. Cardano dropped approximately 18%, from $0.61 to $0.51, before recovery set in, and the price peaked at $0.60. The current price of Cardano is $0.59, and the overall rise over the past 24 hours is around 10%. The community sentiment is bullish, and many investors are taking it as an opportunity to buy the dip and pick up Cardano at this low price. Eventually, once the markets establish some normalcy, Cardano’s price is expected to cross over the $0.75 range at the least. IntelMarkets: AI-Powered High Trading ROIs While established coins like Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are gaining momentum from investors looking to pick up bargains while the market is low, the IntelMarkets presale is gaining momentum from investors attracted by its 400% gain potential at launch. The official listing will probably be by early Q3 and the INTL token is expected to list at $0.42. This will mean that current investors who buy INTL tokens at $0.09 in stage 10 will book 400% gains. This is an attractive ROI for any investment category. Combine this with IntelMarkets’ (INTL) strong utility proposition, which will increase its usage and adoption, and INTL investors have a strong upside proposition. As a trading platform that uses AI technology to offer users an easy-to-use, high-performing trading platform with features that ensure that any trade booked will be profitable, IntelMarkets offers users AI-powered trading bots and market analysis tools that yield clear and specific trading signals to ensure high-performing trades. Key Takeaway While Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are due to deliver high returns in the next 100 days as they perform well in rising markets, IntelMarkets is also due to deliver over 400% gains once it lists. This makes it a great pick to invest in, along with the Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens in their current market lows.

These are not the only two nations trying to de-dollarize during Donald Trump’s trade war . Bolivia has announced plans to import electricity using crypto, and French energy utility EDF is exploring whether it can mine Bitcoin with surplus electricity, he added . “These are early signs that Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset into a functional monetary tool,” he said before adding, “particularly in economies looking to bypass the dollar and reduce exposure to US-led financial systems.” BREAKING: VanEck confirms that China and Russia are officially settling some energy trades in Bitcoin as the trade war ramps up.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan echoed the sentiment in an April 9 blog post . The Trump administration “wants a weaker dollar, even if it means ending its role as the world’s reserve currency,” he said before pointing out that dollar weakness historically correlates with Bitcoin strength. He added that the world may move away from a single reserve currency such as the dollar to a “more fractured reserve system, with hard money like Bitcoin and gold playing a bigger role than it does today.” Other analysts are also of the opinion that a weakening greenback is good for crypto. $DXY [1W] continues to fall steeply and is not far away from breaking down from this triangular bearish continuation pattern.

This time, the asset-backed stablecoin fell under $0.90, with a low around $0.83. The sUSD stablecoin issued by Synthetix has fallen below $0.90, with a low around $0.83. This is the second de-pegging event for sUSD in the past month. The stablecoin is issued on a relatively small scale, with only 30.3M in circulating supply. The sUSD stablecoin may face more de-pegging events due to a shift in its collateral and minting rules. | Source: Coingecko For sUSD, this is the second de-peg since the end of March, for a total of three de-pegs in the past month. The asset has a five-year history with much deeper crises and lows of $0.40, lining up among the riskier stablecoins. The price levels of sUSD remained relatively flat during the 2023 bear market, but de-pegs resumed after market volatility increased. The current event arrives after Synthetix doubled the supply of sUSD in one month, by encouraging SNX token staking. The current supply of sUSD stablecoins is around 10% of the levels from 2021, when the supply peaked above 294M tokens. Synthetix tried to revive sUSD after the supply fell to a recent low of only 15M tokens. At that time, the stablecoin sank to lows of $0.92-$0.91 and Synthetix had to intervene and explain the de-peg. According to the stablecoin issuer, sUSD is still in a transitionary period, where de-pegs may be expected, and the protocol will work toward stabilizing the asset again. Synthetix aims to rebuild assets The current expansion of sUSD is tied to the Synthetix 420 Pool, where former SNX stakers can deposit more tokens and receive passive income. Previously, Synthetix worked as a DeFi protocol, where traders had to manually control their debt, often leading to liquidations. Previously, individual wallets could mint sUSD with a collateral ratio of 750% for SNX deposits, meaning each $7.50 in SNX minted one sUSD. Currently, the 420 pool mints sUSD based on all the deposited tokens, with the intention of bringing the collateral ratio down to 200%. In the coming year, there will be no quick mechanism to buy sUSD at pennies for the dollar, hence the risk of additional de-pegs. The effect of sUSD may be limited, as the token mostly uses other DEXs to trade against USDT and USDC. However, the new minting model tests the approach of Synthetix to generate and retain a reliable stablecoin. Every SNX owner that deposits into the 420 pool will have their debt forgiven over a 12-month period. Early exits will incur a penalty, so the current de-peg will not lead to an outflow of SNX staking. Users who stake SNX in the new pool will have to wait for a predetermined period to have their previous debt waivered. In the meantime, the deposited SNX is used to mint sUSD, with a 500% over-collateralization ratio. Currently, Synthetix has only regained $74M in value locked, down from over $2B during the 2021 bull market. The expanded supply of sUSD in the past month arrives during a golden age for stablecoin issuance and usage. However, smaller projects relying on crypto collaterals remain riskier. After the news of the de-peg, SNX traded at $0.63, near a three-month low. The Synthetix project sits outside the narrative of RWA protocols, and operates as a collateralized stablecoin issuer offering passive income. Synthetix remains one of the most active issuers for tokenized RWA, though its token lags behind ONDO and OM, which are now taking the bulk of mindshare and trading. The project also has support from the Synthetix DAO, with over $32M in its treasury. The DAO carries a diverse portfolio with 1M USDC, $731K in SNX tokens, and the remainder in various stablecoins and even meme tokens like PEPE. Synthetix is one of the oldest DeFi protocols, having survived multiple market cycles since 2018. For sUSD, the risk may be short-lived, but the protocol users may have stressful days ahead, combined with the general crypto market volatility.

SEC Lawsuit Update Coming on April 16?,https://cryptopotato.com/important-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-update-coming-on-april-16/,"TL;DR The XRP army is awaiting developments on April 16, when Ripple’s appellate brief is due. Legal expert Fred Rispoli suggests there’s a 90% chance of a settlement or withdrawal notice. The Official End is Near? The Ripple community celebrated the supposed end of the lengthy lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month when CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the agency had dropped its appeal against the company. However, the regulator has remained silent on the matter, raising the question of whether the case has truly reached its conclusion. The US attorney Fred Rispoli expects to see something happening on that front on April 16 or before. The date marks Ripple’s scheduled appellate brief. The legal expert believes there is a minor 10% possibility that the firm files the document, while the chance of a notice of settlement/withdrawal is set at 90%. Rispoli also claimed that Ripple made the announcement about the dropped appeal without written assurances from the SEC. “Nothing official has been done yet to effectuate the public announcement,” he added. The Latest Confrontation A filing from Justin W. Keener became the recent bone of contention between Ripple and the SEC. The court document was submitted at the start of April and represents “an emergency request” to Judge Analisa Torres to “present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” It remains unclear how the information aids Ripple, but it hints at ties to investment contracts Keener has collected. Meanwhile, the agency recently sued him for acting as an unregistered penny stock dealer, leading to a $10 million penalty. Earlier this week, the Commission opposed the “emergency request” for three important reasons. It claimed that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the filing since the case had already been transferred to the Second Circuit and argued that Keener failed to file the correct motion to intervene. Furthermore, the SEC labeled the request “unnecessary,” asserting that Ripple is capable of deciding for itself whether the evidence could benefit its case. The post Important Ripple v.

Trump Halt Tariffs for 90-day, China Saw 125% Hike On April 9, Trump made a strong statement on Truth Social , saying China has shown “a lack of respect for world markets.” In response, we’ve raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, effective immediately. At the same post, he mentioned that more than 75 countries have been in talks with U.S. representatives from Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR about ongoing trade issues. Meanwhile, to encourage negotiations, Trump announced a temporary 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries and reduced reciprocal tariffs to 10% during this period.

At the same time, 24-hour trading volume has jumped nearly 487% to over $2.1 million, as per CoinGecko data . This reflects growing market activity as concerns rise. Synthetix ( SNX ) is a decentralized finance protocol that lets users create and trade synthetic assets, which track the value of real-world assets on-chain. With the help of oracle data, its stablecoin, sUSD, is designed to mirror the price of the US dollar and is backed by the platform’s native token, SNX. The recent drop in sUSD’s price comes after the launch of SIP-420, a new proposal that introduced the “420 Pool.” This pool allows SNX holders to mint more sUSD with less collateral, lowering the limit to 200% instead of the previous 500%. Analysts claim that the main reason the stablecoin is falling from its peg is because of the sharp rise in the supply of sUSD, brought about by the lowered collateral requirement.

Although sUSD is still overcollateralized, its peg now depends more on market dynamics than direct arbitrage or traditional debt repayment methods. https://twitter.com/panterafii/status/1907187314239135964?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Synthetix developers have described this as a “transitionary period.” In its Discord , the team said it plans to boost incentives for liquidity pools and expand utility for sUSD through initiatives like Snaxchain. “During this transition there is excess sUSD in the market causing pressure on the price of sUSD (which is still healthily over-collateralised). We will continue to work on managing (increasing in the short term) incentives for curve pools, supporting the Infinex deposit campaign (will extend) and creating additional sinks for sUSD that will provide long term price support (snaxchain coming)” — Synthetix’s Discord statement This isn’t the first time sUSD has slipped below its peg. Core contributors reassured users of continued efforts to restore stability following similar incidents in March and May of 2024. While some believe that the problem is manageable others, like DeFi analyst Eldar, caution that the current model might not be able to sustain the peg in the long run without a clearer material value backing SNX. However, Kain Warwick, the founder of Synthetix , is still hopeful. He recently added more SNX to his holdings and stated that the current depeg is a short-term mechanism in SIP-420 implementation.

Analysts were quick to warn that the move could only provide temporary relief. “While the tariff suspension is good news, it is only for 90 days. This trade war is far from over. The uncertainty could make decision-making difficult for businesses that have been planning months in advance,” said Chris Stadele, a corporate analyst. Stadele also pointed to low trading volumes on Emini S&P 500 futures on CME ahead of the announcement, suggesting investors were hesitant to commit in either direction: “We don’t know yet whether the recovery in the markets is a short squeeze or a real risk appetite.” Related News: BREAKING: SEC Approves Options on Ethereum Spot ETFs! Major Development FX Managing Director Amarjit Sahota echoed similar concerns: “Markets may have responded positively in the short term, but this 90-day delay brings more uncertainty. This looks like a hasty political maneuver rather than a sound economic strategy.” Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers, called the decision a “surprise,” especially given the previous firm stance by U.S. officials declaring the tariffs non-negotiable: “The uncertainty has diminished but not gone away. Companies are now wondering if the tariffs will come back after 90 days.” Economist Nouriel Roubini, often referred to as “Dr. Doom” for correctly predicting the 2008 financial crisis, warned that the Fed was unlikely to act as a buffer for Trump’s tariff maneuvers. “There is a reckoning between Trump’s bottom and Powell’s bottom,” Roubini said, referring to political and monetary thresholds for taking action. “But Powell will wait for Trump to blink first.” Roubini believes the Fed will likely keep interest rates steady, contrary to growing market expectations of multiple rate cuts. *This is not investment advice.

According to the official filing from New York State Assembly member Clyde Vanel, Assembly Bill AA7716 aims to study how the blockchain can be used to protect voter personal records as well as safeguard the election results. At press time, the bill is currently being reviewed by the Assembly Election Law Committee, awaiting a legislative vote. Once it advances, it would have to pass through to the Assembly and State level before it is reviewed by the state governor for approval. According to the bill, the New York Board of Elections should conduct a formal study that evaluates how blockchain technology can be utilized to improve U.S. elections, particularly to protect voter records and ensure transparency with regards to election results. The bill mandates the New York State Board of Elections to collaborate with the Office of Information Technology Services, and request assistance from experts knowledgeable in blockchain technology, cybersecurity, voter fraud and election systems. You might also like: U.S. Congressman to introduce a bill ensuring the strategic Bitcoin reserve cannot be revoked If the bill does get enacted, New York’s Board of Elections would have to present the results of the study no later than one year after the bill is formalized. The Board’s findings must include examples of how other states have implemented similar technological solutions in their elections. A long-time advocate for crypto and blockchains, Vanel recently teamed up with Maryland delegate Adrian Boafo to push for Democratic lawmakers to establish a federal cryptocurrency regulatory framework. He also filed for a similar bill back in 2017, but it did not pass through. The use of blockchain technology to safeguard elections is not a new concept. In March 2024, permissionless zero-knowledge registry Rarimo launched a digital identity protocol called the Freedom Tool, which was designed to revolutionize electoral systems through the blockchain. Unlike traditional voting mechanisms, the Freedom Tool uses blockchain technology and identity management in order to make each vote anonymous and verifiable. In October 2024, Rarimo’s Freedom Tool was implemented into a government electoral system when Georgian opposition party, the United National Movement, launched United Space — an identity app powered by Rarimo — ahead of its parliamentary elections. The app’s blockchain-based technology provided voters with a system that was free of privacy violation concerns and potential voter manipulation. It also ensured citizens had a level of anonymity that traditional election systems could not.

This has seen the cryptocurrency lose almost 50% of its acquired value between late 2024 and early 2025. Nevertheless, this has failed to erode bullish sentiment, with predictions for higher prices dominating the community. Time To Go Long On The XRP Price? A crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) has renewed bullish hope after identifying an important formation on the XRP price chart. The analysis pointed out that the XRP Price is still moving within a descending channel, a formation that usually signals a bearish move. Related Reading: Major Ethereum Whale Dumps 10,000 ETH After 2 Years, Is It Time To Get Out? However, the downtrend has pushed the altcoin’s price to the point where it is now testing the bottom trend line. This bottom trend line has been known to act as strong support previously and is expected to do so this time around. With the support forming, it is likely that the XRP Price is gearing up for a bounce from this level. Furthermore, the crypto analyst points out that XRP is also forming a rounded bottom inside this descending channel. Such a rounded bottom could signal an end to the downtrend from here. As the formation grows, the main level of support is now sitting at $1.6. So far, this level has held up quite nicely and bulls have been using it as a bounce-off point for recovery. Given this, the crypto analyst advises that entries for the XRP price are best at around $1.70 to $1.85. This is not the only good news for the XRP price with support forming. If it holds and the altcoin does indeed bounce from this level toward $2, then the next important levels lie between $2 and $2.2. These serve as the levels for the bulls to beat to confirm a bullish continuation toward a possible all-time high. If the bulls are successful, then three profit targets are placed by the crypto analyst. These include $2.3385, $2.8160, and $3.3062, pushing it toward January 2025 highs. Related Reading: Uncertainty Rocks Market As ETH/BTC Drops To 6-Year Low, Where Is Bitcoin Headed Next? The Bearish Case While the analysis is inherently bullish, there is still the possibility of invalidation that could send the XRP price tumbling further. As the analyst points out, the major support currently lies at $1.6. This means that bulls must hold this level. Otherwise, there is the risk of a much deeper correction as a liquidity sweep could send support further down to $1.3. Nevertheless, with buy sentiments building once again, it is likely that XRP will follow the bullish scenario in this case.

Total bitcoin spot trading volume on crypto exchanges declined from a high of $44 billion on February 3 to $10 billion at the end of Q1, a nearly 77% drop, according to the analytics firm. Meanwhile, total altcoin spot trading volume on crypto exchanges declined from a high of $122 billion on February 3 to $23 billion at the end of Q1 — a more than 80% fall. A volume drop of such magnitude suggests traders and investors are losing interest or confidence, possibly due to uncertainty or fear. Falling prices mean the value of bitcoin and other cryptos is going down, which can scare off more people, creating a cycle of less trading and lower prices, the report added. Market's loss is Binance's gain During the same time, Binance increased its dominance over the other crypto exchanges with its share of total market trading reaching almost 50%. Binance's share of total daily bitcoin spot trading volume increased from 33% on February 3 to 49% by the end of Q1. This implies that trading volumes on other exchanges declined much faster than on Binance, and that the exchange becomes the largest liquidity venue during times of higher market volatility. Furthermore, Binance's share of total daily altcoin spot trading volume increased from 38% on February 3 to 44% by the end of Q1. Some altcoins still show relatively high spot trading volumes on Binance, in spite of the overall slowdown in trading volumes. For example, large altcoins like BNB, TON and EOS are still being traded with relatively high activity, at a time that overall crypto volumes have declined. Meanwhile, bitcoin inflows to Binance have accelerated in the past week, CryptoQuant independent analyst Martuun wrote. “The bitcoin reserve on Binance has increased from 568,768 BTC (Mar 28) to 590,874 BTC (Apr 9), an increase of 22,106 BTC,” he said in a snippet . “This shows a strong acceleration in BTC inflows to Binance. It’s likely that investors are actively moving funds to Binance, due the macro uncertainty and before the upcoming CPI announcement.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Binance,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 08:05:05

Recently, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale had moved 1,030,000 SOL, worth $110.29 million, from the Kraken exchange. 1,030,000 #SOL (110,291,760 USD) transferred from #Kraken to unknown wallet https://t.co/3X5bwrX41C — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 9, 2025 However, the wallet address of the whale remains unknown. Why is Solana (SOL) Price Rising? This substantial SOL transfer occurred while the cryptocurrency market was experiencing downside momentum ahead of Donald Trump’s 90-day tariff pause announcement. The timing has raised concerns of potential insider information, as SOL—along with other assets—skyrocketed following the transaction. At press time, SOL is trading near $119 and has recorded a price surge of over 13.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 35%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Following the surge in SOL’s price, the asset has reached a key resistance level, which has been formed by a descending trendline since early February 2025. According to expert technical analysis, SOL is on the verge of breaking out of a bullish falling wedge price action pattern. Based on recent price action, if the current market sentiment remains unchanged, there is a strong possibility it could breach this pattern and rally significantly. According to the daily chart, if SOL closes a daily candle above $125, the asset could potentially soar by 40% to reach the $180 level. Source: Trading View At present, SOL is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both the four-hour and daily timeframes, which still indicates that the asset is in a downtrend. Traders Key Levels Despite the current market sentiment and the price forming a bullish pattern, traders are seen betting on the bearish side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass.

Binance’s Vote to Delist program is part of its ongoing effort to improve transparency and give the community a voice in listing decisions. According to the platform’s Apr. 10 announcement , the tokens up for potential delisting are FTT, JASMY, VOXEL, GPS, ZEC, STPT, ARK, ARDR, MBL, PERP, NKN, WING, LTO, FLM, BSW, ALPACA, and PDA. Voting will take place through Binance Square between Apr. 10 at 4:00 UTC and Apr. 16 at 23:59 UTC. Users must have a verified Binance account and hold at least 0.01 BNB during the voting period in order to be eligible. Each user can vote for up to five tokens, with one vote per project. While Binance will consider community feedback, it clarified that the outcome of the vote won’t be the only deciding factor. Other elements such as project activity, liquidity, team responsiveness, and regulatory risks will influence the final delisting decision.

Binance cited concerns about compliance, slow development, and poor trading activity as some of the reasons for their delisting. In another recent development, on Apr. 9, Binance introduced LDUSDT, a new reward-bearing margin asset designed to boost capital efficiency. With LDUSDT, users can convert Tether ( USDT ) from Simple Earn, Binance’s savings product, into a margin asset for futures trading while still earning real-time APR rewards. This feature gives users more flexibility by enabling them to use the same capital in two different ways.

For those deeply invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding the implications of this appointment is now more crucial than ever. What changes can we expect under Atkins’ leadership, and how will these changes impact the future of crypto innovation and investment? Who is Paul Atkins, the New SEC Chair? Before we delve into the potential impacts on crypto regulation , it’s important to understand who Paul Atkins is and what he brings to the table as the new SEC Chair . Atkins is not a newcomer to the Securities and Exchange Commission . He previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, nominated by President George W. Bush. During his tenure, he was known for his expertise in financial markets and his focus on regulatory efficiency and investor protection. His background includes: Extensive Experience: Years of experience within the SEC itself, giving him an insider’s perspective on the agency’s operations and challenges. Market Acumen: Deep understanding of how financial markets operate, particularly in the context of traditional securities. Conservative Approach: Often associated with a more conservative and market-oriented approach to regulation, emphasizing principles of free markets and limited government intervention. This background suggests that Atkins’ leadership at the SEC could bring about significant changes in the regulatory landscape, especially concerning emerging sectors like cryptocurrency. What Does Atkins’ Appointment Mean for Crypto Regulation? The big question on everyone’s mind in the crypto space is: how will Paul Atkins’ appointment as SEC Chair affect crypto regulation ? While it’s still early days, we can analyze potential directions based on his past statements and regulatory philosophy. Here are some key areas to consider: 1. Potential for Stricter Enforcement Given his background in traditional financial markets and focus on investor protection, Atkins might bring a more stringent approach to enforcing existing securities laws within the crypto space. This could mean: Increased Scrutiny of ICOs and Token Sales: Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales have long been a gray area in regulation. Atkins’ SEC might take a harder stance on classifying many tokens as securities, leading to stricter registration and compliance requirements. Crackdown on Unregistered Exchanges and Platforms: Platforms facilitating the trading of digital assets may face increased pressure to register with the SEC and adhere to securities regulations. More Aggressive Action Against Fraud and Market Manipulation: The SEC under Atkins could be more proactive in investigating and prosecuting cases of fraud, insider trading, and market manipulation within the cryptocurrency market. 2. Clarity vs. Ambiguity in Regulatory Frameworks One of the persistent challenges in crypto regulation has been the lack of clear guidelines. Will Atkins’ SEC provide more clarity, or will ambiguity continue to prevail? Potential for Clarity: Some experts believe that a leader with Atkins’ experience could bring a more structured and defined approach to regulation. This could involve issuing clearer guidelines on when digital assets are considered securities, providing a more predictable environment for businesses operating in the crypto space. Risk of Over-Regulation: Conversely, a stricter regulatory stance could also stifle innovation. If the SEC adopts overly broad definitions of securities or imposes burdensome compliance requirements, it could drive crypto innovation overseas or hinder the growth of the industry in the U.S. 3. Focus on Investor Protection Investor protection is a cornerstone of the SEC’s mission, and Atkins is expected to prioritize this. In the context of crypto regulation , this could translate to: Enhanced Disclosure Requirements: Companies involved in crypto may face stricter requirements to disclose risks, financial information, and project details to investors. Emphasis on Due Diligence: Investors might be encouraged to exercise greater due diligence and be wary of high-risk crypto investments. Educational Initiatives: The SEC could ramp up investor education efforts to make the public more aware of the risks and complexities of investing in cryptocurrencies. The Impact on Different Crypto Sectors The new SEC Chair ‘s approach to crypto regulation will likely have varying impacts across different sectors within the crypto ecosystem: Crypto Sector Potential Impact Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Increased scrutiny due to its complex and often opaque nature. DeFi protocols may face pressure to comply with securities laws if deemed applicable. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) Uncertain impact. NFTs that are primarily collectibles may face less regulatory pressure than those that are marketed as investment vehicles. Cryptocurrency Exchanges Likely to face stricter oversight and potential requirements for registration and compliance, especially if they list tokens considered securities. Stablecoins Continued regulatory focus. Stablecoins, especially those not backed by reserves, may face increased scrutiny and potential regulatory action. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Navigating the evolving landscape of crypto regulation under Paul Atkins will present both challenges and opportunities for the crypto industry: Challenges: Compliance Costs: Stricter regulations could mean higher compliance costs for crypto businesses, potentially hindering smaller startups and projects. Regulatory Uncertainty: While clarity is hoped for, there’s also a risk that the regulatory environment could become even more complex and uncertain in the short term as new rules are developed and implemented. Potential for Enforcement Actions: Companies operating in gray areas could face increased risk of enforcement actions from the SEC. Opportunities: Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Clear and sensible regulations can provide legitimacy to the crypto industry, potentially attracting more institutional investors and fostering mainstream adoption. Innovation within Regulatory Frameworks: A well-defined regulatory framework can encourage innovation within established boundaries, leading to more sustainable and compliant crypto projects. Investor Confidence: Stronger investor protection measures can boost confidence in the crypto market, attracting a broader range of investors. Actionable Insights for Crypto Stakeholders Given these potential shifts in crypto regulation , what should crypto businesses, investors, and enthusiasts do? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on SEC announcements, guidance, and enforcement actions under Atkins’ leadership. Seek Legal Counsel: Crypto businesses should consult with legal experts to ensure compliance with existing and evolving regulations. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in industry discussions and engage with regulators to provide feedback and contribute to the development of sensible regulations. Prioritize Compliance: Even in the absence of perfect clarity, prioritize compliance with existing securities laws and best practices. Conclusion: Navigating the New Regulatory Era The confirmation of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair marks a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. His deep experience in financial markets and focus on investor protection suggest a potentially more assertive approach to crypto regulation . While this may present challenges in terms of compliance and potential enforcement, it also offers opportunities for greater legitimacy, mainstream adoption, and investor confidence in the long run. The coming months and years will be crucial in shaping the regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S., and stakeholders must remain vigilant, informed, and proactive to navigate this new era successfully.

BTC Skyrockets It has been a wild ride in the crypto industry lately, prompted by Trump’s continuous moves on the macro scene.

At the same time, he paused for 90 days the taxes against all other countries. All of this news brought massive volatility to crypto.
