A swearing-in ceremony will soon put the former SEC commission in charge of the high-profile regulator — a matter cheered on by the digital assets sector that sees him as a strong ally after his significant background advising crypto firms as a financial-services consultant in Washington. Atkins' Senate confirmation was easily cleared on Wednesday in a 52-44 vote. The longtime figure in U.S. financial policy — both in government and as an outside adviser — was generally expected to easily move through confirmation, though the Senate Banking Committee approved Atkins along party lines , with all the panel's Democrats opposing the nominee. Atkins' confirmation took the usual months to emerge from the Senate, and in the time between the departure of predecessor Gary Gensler and Atkins' arrival, Trump's interim agency chief, Mark Uyeda, carried out an ambitious and rapidly deployed crypto overhaul. The SEC has thrown out almost all of its high-profile digital assets enforcement actions, and its staff quickly outlined a number of segments of the industry that it considers outside its jurisdiction — including some stablecoins, memecoins (such as the president's own $TRUMP) and proof-of-work mining. Many of the areas in which the agency has already demonstrated policy shifts overlap with Trump's family crypto businesses, including the family's memecoins and its ties to World Liberty Financial, which has pursued its own stablecoin. Atkins will be taking over those issues to apply permanent standards, potentially directed by future legislation that's now a priority in Congress. Atkins' tenure will begin with an incomplete commission, which is meant to have five members and whose sole Democrat — Caroline Crenshaw — is occupying an already expired term. The White House hasn't yet moved to fill the two Democratic positions on the commission.",Policy|Top Stories|Breaking News|Paul Atkins|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Senate,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 23:50:11
43144401,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147928,1744242627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking $1B US Fine Looms for TSMC in Huawei AI Chip Export Control Storm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-fine-tsmc-huawei-ai-chip/,"The tech world is buzzing with news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a giant in chip manufacturing, could be facing a monumental US fine . Reports suggest this penalty could reach a staggering $1 billion or more. The reason? A US export control investigation linked to a chip allegedly made by TSMC and used in a Huawei AI processor. This development, initially reported by Reuters, has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and technology sectors, raising questions about international trade and technological sovereignty. Why is the US considering a fine against TSMC? The core of the issue revolves around potential violations of US export control regulations. Let’s break down what we know: The Allegations : The investigation centers on a chip manufactured by TSMC that reportedly found its way into Huawei’s advanced Ascend 910B AI processor. The Players : Key entities involved are TSMC, Huawei, and Xiamen Sophgo Technologies (Sophgo), a Chinese chip designer affiliated with Bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain. The Timeline : This situation first surfaced in late 2024, with investigations unfolding into 2025. According to reports, the chip in question was designed by Sophgo and manufactured by TSMC. It’s then alleged that this Sophgo chip was incorporated into Huawei’s Ascend 910B AI chip . This multi-layered arrangement is crucial because Huawei’s processor is considered a cutting-edge piece of technology, especially for being produced in China. The estimated production runs into hundreds of thousands of units, amplifying the potential scale of the export control breach. TSMC, in response to these allegations, stated, “TSMC is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” They further emphasized their proactive communication with the U.S. Commerce Department and commitment to compliance. Timeline of Events: Unpacking the TSMC-Huawei-Sophgo Situation To better understand the gravity of this potential US fine , let’s look at a timeline of key events: Date Event Significance October 2024 TechInsights, a Canadian research firm, disassembles Huawei’s 910B AI processor. Discovery of a TSMC-based chipset inside, resembling a Sophgo design, triggering initial concerns. November 2024 U.S. Department of Commerce orders TSMC to halt advanced chip shipments to Chinese customers, including Sophgo. Escalation of US scrutiny and direct impact on TSMC’s business with Chinese firms. December 2024 U.S. Commerce Department considers adding Sophgo to the U.S. blacklist. Increased pressure on Sophgo and further tightening of export controls. January 2025 U.S. adds over twenty Chinese companies, including Sophgo and Zhipu AI, to the blacklist. Formal blacklisting of Sophgo, restricting its access to US technology and markets. What’s at Stake for TSMC and the Chip Industry? The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is not just about the money. It carries significant implications: Financial Impact : A billion-dollar fine is substantial, even for a company as large as TSMC. It could impact their profitability and future investments. Reputational Damage : Allegations of export control violations can tarnish TSMC’s reputation as a trusted global chip manufacturer. Geopolitical Ramifications : This incident underscores the escalating tensions in the global technology race, particularly between the US and China. It highlights the complexities of supply chains and international regulations in the semiconductor industry. Industry-Wide Alert : This case serves as a stark reminder for all chip manufacturers about the stringent enforcement of export controls and the need for meticulous compliance. Huawei ‘s Role and the Tech Cold War Huawei , at the center of this controversy, has been a focal point of US-China tech tensions for years. The US government has repeatedly expressed concerns about Huawei’s technology and its potential national security implications. The alleged use of TSMC-manufactured chips in Huawei’s AI processor further intensifies this ongoing tech cold war. For Huawei , securing advanced AI chips is crucial for maintaining its competitiveness in the global market. Despite US sanctions, Huawei has shown resilience and continues to innovate. This situation underscores the immense pressure on Chinese tech companies to achieve self-sufficiency in critical technologies like semiconductors. Export Control Compliance: A New Era for Tech Companies? This unfolding situation with TSMC emphasizes the critical importance of export control compliance for tech companies operating globally. The regulations are complex and constantly evolving, requiring companies to be vigilant and proactive in their compliance efforts. Key takeaways for tech companies: Robust Compliance Programs : Companies need to invest in comprehensive export control compliance programs. Due Diligence : Thorough due diligence is essential to ensure adherence to all applicable regulations. Transparency and Communication : Open communication with regulatory authorities is crucial when potential issues arise. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for TSMC, Huawei, and US-China Tech Relations? The outcome of the US fine investigation into TSMC will be closely watched by the global tech industry. It will not only impact TSMC and Huawei but also set precedents for how export controls are enforced in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and semiconductor technology. As the investigation progresses, the industry braces for potential shifts in supply chains, compliance strategies, and the delicate balance of US-China tech relations. The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is a stark reminder of the high stakes in the global tech arena. It highlights the intricate web of international regulations, technological innovation, and geopolitical tensions that define the modern semiconductor industry. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech investors alike, this saga underscores the interconnectedness of global technology policy and market dynamics.

As of 8th of April 2025 , Solana trades at $107 , XRP at $1.75 , Ethereum at $1,520 , and MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.0002772 in its presale. While the first three leverage established ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5.5 million presale raise and $5 target—a 71,329% ROI—could outshine them all by 2025 . Solana: A 500% Gain to $642? Solana, at $107 after a 10% dip in 7 days , is a favorite for its 4,000 transactions per second and $5 billion DeFi TVL across 1,000+ projects. Its 8,000% growth since 2021 shows promise. Coinpedia forecasts $1,000 by 2025 , an 834% gain, turning $100 into $934 . A 500% gain requires $642 , achievable by late 2025 , per X posts, if Solana’s NFT and gaming sectors grow. However, its $50 billion market cap (adjusted for $107 price) and competition from layer-1s like Aptos ( $2 billion TVL) may cap its upside in a bearish market. XRP: Targeting $10.50 for 500%? XRP, down 15% to $1.75 as of 7th of April 2025 , benefits from its SEC settlement on 25th of March 2025 , reducing a $125 million fine to $50 million . Its 1,500 transactions per second at 0.00001 XRP per transaction and 300+ financial partnerships drive adoption. Bitnation predicts $12 by 2026 , but some X posts see $10 by 2025 , a 471% gain, making $100 worth $571 . A 500% gain needs $10.50 , possible by 2025 if ETF approvals materialize, though its $118 billion market cap and RLUSD competition ( $170 million cap) pose challenges. Ethereum: 500% to $9,120 in Reach? Ethereum, at $1,520 after a 15% drop in 7 days , boasts a 619,116% historical ROI and $182 billion market cap (adjusted for $1,520 price). Its layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( $1.5 billion TVL) and 1,000+ dApps fuel growth. Analysts on X predict $10,000 by 2025 , a 558% gain, turning $100 into $658 . A 500% gain requires $9,120 , possible by 2025 , per Changelly, if tokenization and staking ( $100 billion locked) accelerate. Ethereum’s gas fees ( $2.50 average) and competition from Solana may slow its path to 500% in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Rising Star Analysts Predict Could Deliver 18,500% Returns 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $5.5 million , with Phase 7 at 80% sold out as of 5th of April 2025 . Priced at $0.0002772 , its listing price of $0.007 offers a 2,500% ROI—already surpassing 500% . Analysts forecast $5 by 2025 , a 71,329% gain from listing. A $100 investment buys 360,750 tokens, worth $2,500 at listing and $1.8 million at $5 . A 500% gain is hit at just $0.00166 , a fraction of its target. With a 100% Hashex audit, DeFi lending at 20%+ yields, and 50,000 supporters growing by 12,000 weekly across 30+ countries, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 1,570.6% presale rise from Stage 1 sets it apart. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshines the Pack Solana ( $642 ), XRP ( $10.50 ), and Ethereum ( $9,120 ) need 500% gains that their large market caps ( $50 billion , $118 billion , $182 billion ) make tough in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 target and 71,329% potential—already 2,500% at listing—leverage a smaller cap. Its $5.5 million raise, against XRP’s $1.5 million weekly inflow, shows stronger retail faith. A $100 investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE hits $10K at $0.027 , a 100x , making 500% a mere milestone.

Last month, the DeFi project announced plans to launch a new stablecoin called USD1, which it says is pegged to the US dollar and backed by short-term government treasuries, dollar deposits and cash equivalents. Now, World Liberty wants to test its on-chain airdrop feature by distributing a small amount of USD1 to all current WLFI token holders. In a new proposal , the project says the final exact amount will be based “on total eligible wallets and budget.” Explains World Liberty, “Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1.” World Liberty notes in the fine print on its website that President Donald Trump is not an officer, director, founder, or employee of the firm or any of its affiliates, but the company does name the president as the “Chief Crypto Advocate.” World Liberty’s website also states that DT Marks DEFI LLC, an entity affiliated with Trump and some of his family members, holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens and is entitled to receive fees from the project.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy Flashes Warning,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sale-to-cover-debt-michael-saylors-strategy-flashes-warning/,"Strategy, the software company led by Michael Saylor, might need to sell some of its massive Bitcoin holdings to pay its bills. The company revealed this possibility in a regulatory filing on April 7, saying that without new financing, it could be forced to sell Bitcoin to cover financial obligations. Company Faces Billions In Potential Q1 Losses According to the filing, Strategy expects to report an unrealized loss of nearly $6 billion for the first quarter of 2025. This comes despite having a $1.7 billion tax benefit. The company currently holds over 528,000 B TC purchased at about $67,450 per coin, as Saylor posted on X on March 31. Their total investment amounts to more than $35 billion. Debt And Dividend Pressure Mounts The pressure on Strategy’s finances is growing. The company has roughly $8 billion in debt and must pay about $35 million in yearly interest payments. On top of that, it needs to distribute $150 million in annual dividends. $MSTR has acquired 22,048 BTC for ~$1.92 billion at ~$86,969 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 11.0% YTD 2025. As of 3/30/2025, @Strategy holds 528,185 $BTC acquired for ~$35.63 billion at ~$67,458 per bitcoin. $STRK $STRF https://t.co/1sfyBIglnt — Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 31, 2025 Reports suggest the company’s software business doesn’t make enough money to cover these costs. If Bitcoin prices drop, the company’s ability to manage its debt could be in trouble. New Funding Plan Announced To fix its cash problems , Strategy announced on March 10 plans to raise $2.1 billion by selling perpetual preferred stock with an 8% dividend. This move would help the company get money without taking on more traditional debt. The rumor has it that Strategy filed an 8-K form with the SEC on April 7, stating that if the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, the company may be forced to sell its Bitcoin holdings to repay debts. It was found that this statement is a standard risk disclosure practice, and it… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 9, 2025 The funds would support both company operations and, surprisingly, the purchase of even more Bitcoin. Based on reports from Wu Blockchain, warnings like these have appeared in past filings, suggesting this might be standard disclosure language rather than a new emergency. Bitcoin Price Trends And Expert Predictions Bitcoin trades at about $76,100 right now, which is down 8% over the past week. While this price is still above Strategy’s average purchase cost, market volatility puts the company in a risky position. Not everyone sees doom ahead, though. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an April 8 interview that Bitcoin could reach $110,000 or higher in the coming months. He believes central banks will soon cut interest rates, increasing global cash flow and helping Bitcoin’s price rise as a deflationary asset. The situation highlights how closely Strategy’s fate is now tied to BTC’s performance. While the company tries to secure more funding, its future depends largely on whether the cryptocurrency market moves up or down in the months ahead.

The ETF, trading under the ticker XXRP, achieved this milestone as cryptocurrency markets faced widespread selling pressure. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the performance “very respectable” given the current bearish market conditions. Related Reading: XRP Will Explode—And This Korean Expert Says He’ll Be ‘Laughing’ At Critics XRP Price Hits Five-Month Low As New ETF Launches According to market data, XRP’s price dropped to $1.61 on Monday, marking its lowest point in five months. The price briefly recovered to over $1.87 on Tuesday before falling again to $1.69 by evening. Even with these unstable price movements, Teucrium moved forward with its ETF launch, aiming to give investors a way to profit from price swings in either direction. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 New XRP ETF Outperforms Similar Solana Product Based on reports from Bloomberg’s Balchunas, the XXRP ETF’s first-day trading volume was about four times higher than what Solana’s similar 2x ETF saw on its launch day. This performance puts Teucrium’s product in the top 5% of all new ETF launches. However, the $5.43 million figure still pales in comparison to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF debut, which saw trading volume roughly 200 times larger. Community Shows Interest Despite Broad Market Losses The altcoin community has responded positively to the ETF launch, especially considering the harsh market conditions. Data shows that 137,000 traders faced liquidations in the 24 hours surrounding the launch, with total losses exceeding $413 million across cryptocurrency markets. Some XRP supporters have suggested that while XXRP’s volume was much smaller than BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a potential spot ETF (which some have dubbed “IXRP”) could provide stronger competition. How The 2x XRP ETF Works And Its Risks Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold the underlying asset, Teucrium’s XXRP does not invest directly in XRP tokens. Instead, it’s designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP’s price movements, which amplifies both gains and losses for investors. Related Reading: XRP Dump? Not So Fast—Software Engineer Says Panic Selling Makes No Sense Community figure Crypto Eri warned about the ETF’s built-in risk factors, noting that even if XRP’s price stays flat, volatility alone could cause significant losses. For example, if XRP experiences 25% volatility, XXRP holders could see a 6% loss. With 70% volatility, those losses could balloon to 40%. The launch comes as more than 10 asset managers have filed applications with the SEC for spot XRP ETFs. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications, though BlackRock has not yet expressed interest in launching an XRP-specific ETF product.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently addressed the Ways & Means Committee, making a statement that has reverberated across economic and political circles. According to reports from Walter Bloomberg X account, Greer indicated that President Donald Trump’s authority to impose tariffs is not without boundaries. This revelation sparks crucial questions about the future of US trade policy and the balance of power within the U.S. government. Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal announcement and explore its potential ramifications. What Did the Trade Representative Reveal About Trump’s Tariff Authority? Jamieson Greer’s appearance before the Ways & Means Committee was closely watched, especially given the Trump administration’s assertive approach to trade and tariffs. His statement, as reported, directly addresses the extent of presidential power in this domain. Here’s a breakdown of what we understand: Not Unlimited Power: The core message is clear – the President’s authority to apply tariffs is not absolute. This suggests there are checks and balances in place, even in matters of trade, which are often considered under executive purview. Congressional Oversight: Greer’s testimony before the Ways & Means Committee itself highlights the role of Congress in overseeing trade policy. The committee’s questioning and Greer’s responses underscore the legislative branch’s interest and influence in this area. Legal and Constitutional Framework: The notion of limited authority implies that tariff decisions are likely subject to a legal and constitutional framework. This could mean that certain tariff actions could be challenged or reviewed, ensuring they align with existing laws and trade agreements. This isn’t just about semantics; it’s about the very foundation of how US trade policy is formulated and implemented. It sets the stage for a potentially more nuanced and collaborative approach to international trade relations. Why is the Scope of Presidential Tariff Authority Under Scrutiny? The question of presidential tariff authority isn’t new, but it has gained prominence in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration. Several factors contribute to this increased scrutiny: Trump Administration’s Trade Actions: President Trump frequently utilized tariffs as a tool in trade negotiations and to address perceived trade imbalances. High-profile tariff disputes with countries like China and the European Union brought the issue of tariff authority to the forefront. Economic Impact of Tariffs: Tariffs can have significant economic consequences, affecting industries, consumers, and international relations. Concerns about these impacts naturally lead to questions about the process and authority behind tariff decisions. Separation of Powers: In the U.S. system of government, the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is fundamental. Debates about tariff authority often touch upon the balance of power between the President and Congress in matters of trade. Global Trade Norms: International trade is governed by a complex web of agreements and norms. Unilateral tariff actions can sometimes clash with these norms, raising questions about the consistency and predictability of US trade policy on the global stage. Therefore, Greer’s statement can be seen as part of a broader discussion about the appropriate limits of executive power in trade, especially in a globalized economy where trade policies have far-reaching effects. The Role of the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill Understanding the context of Jamieson Greer’s statement requires looking at the roles of both the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill . The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR): Key Trade Negotiator: The USTR is the primary entity responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and commodity policy. They lead negotiations with foreign governments and represent the U.S. at international trade organizations. Advisor to the President: The Trade Representative serves as the principal trade advisor to the President. Their views and statements carry significant weight in shaping the administration’s trade agenda. Congressional Interaction: While part of the executive branch, the USTR regularly interacts with Congress, particularly committees like the Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade matters. This interaction is crucial for policy alignment and oversight. Capitol Hill and the Ways & Means Committee: Legislative Oversight: Capitol Hill , as the seat of Congress, plays a vital role in legislative oversight of executive actions, including trade policy. Committees like the Ways & Means Committee are specifically tasked with reviewing and shaping trade-related legislation. Public Forum for Debate: Congressional hearings, such as the one where Greer testified, provide a public forum for discussing and debating important policy issues. They allow for transparency and accountability in government actions. Influence on Trade Laws: Congress has the power to enact laws that can shape and constrain presidential authority, including in the area of tariffs. The Ways & Means Committee’s engagement signals a potential legislative interest in clarifying or reinforcing the limits of Trump tariff authority or any presidential tariff authority in the future. The dialogue between the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill is thus a critical part of the checks and balances system, ensuring that trade policy is not solely determined by the executive branch. Implications for Future US Trade and Global Relations Greer’s statement about the limits of Trump tariff authority has several potential implications: More Predictable Trade Policy: If presidential tariff authority is perceived as constrained, it could lead to a more predictable and stable trade policy environment. This predictability is beneficial for businesses, investors, and international partners. Increased Congressional Role: Acknowledging limits on presidential authority could empower Congress to play a more active role in shaping trade policy. This might lead to more bipartisan and consensus-based approaches to trade. Potential for Reduced Trade Tensions: If the U.S. signals a move away from unilateral tariff actions, it could help reduce trade tensions with other countries. This could foster a more cooperative global trade environment. Legal Challenges to Tariffs: The recognition of limits might also open the door for legal challenges to tariffs that are seen as exceeding presidential authority. This could create a more judicial dimension to trade policy oversight. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges: Executive Branch Pushback: Future administrations might push back against perceived limitations on their tariff authority, potentially leading to further political and legal battles. Navigating Geopolitical Tensions: Trade is often intertwined with geopolitical considerations. Limits on tariff authority could constrain the U.S.’s ability to respond assertively to unfair trade practices or geopolitical challenges. Domestic Political Pressures: Domestic industries and political groups may lobby for tariff protections, and a perceived weakening of presidential tariff power could create domestic political tensions. Actionable Insights and Looking Ahead For businesses and stakeholders involved in international trade, Greer’s statement offers several key takeaways and actionable insights: Monitor Policy Developments: Closely track further statements and actions from both the USTR and Capitol Hill regarding trade policy and tariff authority. Policy shifts can significantly impact business strategies. Assess Risk and Opportunity: Evaluate how potential changes in US trade policy might affect your supply chains, markets, and competitive landscape. Identify both risks and opportunities arising from a potentially more constrained approach to tariffs. Engage in Policy Dialogue: Participate in industry associations and engage with policymakers to voice your perspectives on trade policy. Your input can help shape future trade regulations and agreements. Prepare for Legal and Regulatory Scrutiny: Be prepared for potential legal challenges to tariff actions and increased regulatory scrutiny of trade practices. Ensure compliance and seek legal counsel when needed. The unfolding narrative around Trump tariff authority and its limitations is a crucial development in the landscape of international trade. It signals a potential shift towards a more balanced and perhaps less unilateral approach to trade policy. For those operating in the global economic sphere, understanding these nuances is not just academic—it’s essential for strategic planning and navigating the complexities of the modern trade environment. Conclusion: A New Chapter in US Trade Policy? Jamieson Greer’s statement on Capitol Hill , highlighting the limits of presidential Trump tariff authority , marks a potentially pivotal moment for US trade policy . It underscores the enduring principles of checks and balances within the U.S. government and signals a possible recalibration of trade policy away from unilateral actions towards a more collaborative and predictable framework. While the full implications will unfold over time, this development warrants close attention from anyone invested in international trade, global economics, and the evolving dynamics of power in Washington D.C. The future trajectory of US trade policy may well be shaped by this crucial acknowledgement of limitations.

BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price sunk to its lowest level in five months, dropping over 10% from last week. BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. ETH is down ~56% year to date and is ~69% below its record high from November 2021. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. XRP's is down ~23% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

43145018,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147930,1744243813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Shift: Tariff Wars Ignite Crypto Payment Adoption, VanEck Reveals",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tariff-wars-crypto-payment-adoption/,"Are you prepared for a seismic shift in global finance? The escalating trade tensions led by the U.S. are not just reshaping international commerce; they’re inadvertently fueling a surge in crypto payment adoption . VanEck, a well-regarded investment management firm, has released a compelling report highlighting this unexpected consequence of tariff wars. Let’s dive into how these global economic pressures are pushing nations and businesses towards cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Why Tariff Tensions Are a Catalyst for Crypto Payment Adoption? The core of the issue lies in the disruption of traditional financial systems. When countries impose tariffs and engage in trade disputes, the stability of fiat currencies can be called into question. VanEck’s report suggests that this instability, coupled with a desire to circumvent traditional financial rails, is making crypto payment adoption increasingly attractive. Think of it as a financial detour around roadblocks erected by trade wars. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Dollar Weakness: Continued uncertainty and trade imbalances can lead to a weakening U.S. dollar, the world’s reserve currency. This makes alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, more appealing as stores of value and mediums of exchange. Geopolitical Fragmentation: As global alliances shift and trade blocs realign, countries are seeking financial independence. Cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized, borderless solution that sidesteps traditional geopolitical constraints. Sanctions and Restrictions: Tariff wars often go hand-in-hand with sanctions. Cryptocurrencies can provide a route for nations and entities to conduct transactions outside the reach of these restrictions. Desire for Alternatives: Businesses and individuals caught in the crossfire of trade disputes may actively seek alternative payment systems to mitigate risks and ensure smooth transactions. Bitcoin : The Unexpected Beneficiary? While the cryptocurrency landscape is vast, Bitcoin is emerging as a primary beneficiary of this trend. Its established network, decentralized nature, and increasing acceptance as a store of value position it uniquely in this evolving scenario. VanEck’s report highlights specific instances where Bitcoin is gaining traction due to tariff-related pressures. Examples from the Report: China and Russia Energy Deals: Watcher Guru’s report on X indicates that China and Russia are reportedly utilizing cryptocurrencies for some energy transactions. This could be a strategic move to bypass dollar-denominated systems and mitigate the impact of potential tariffs or sanctions on energy trade. Emerging BTC Mining Hubs: Countries like Bolivia, France, and Germany are reportedly exploring Bitcoin mining and energy strategies. This suggests a proactive approach to leveraging Bitcoin, potentially as a means to attract investment, diversify energy resources, and position themselves in the burgeoning crypto economy. What Are the Potential Benefits of Crypto Payments in a Tariff-Driven World? The rise of crypto payment adoption , spurred by tariff tensions, presents several potential advantages: Reduced Transaction Costs: Cross-border transactions using traditional banking systems can be expensive and time-consuming. Cryptocurrencies can offer significantly lower fees and faster settlement times. Increased Efficiency: Crypto transactions are often processed more quickly than traditional bank transfers, streamlining international trade and payments. Greater Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide access to financial services for individuals and businesses in regions with limited banking infrastructure, fostering greater global economic participation. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies, offers enhanced security and transparency in transactions, reducing the risk of fraud and corruption. Are There Challenges to Overcome for Widespread Crypto Payment Adoption? Despite the promising outlook, widespread crypto payment adoption in international trade faces certain hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Lack of clear and consistent regulations can hinder widespread adoption by businesses and institutions. Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrency prices can be volatile, which can be a concern for businesses engaged in international trade. However, stablecoins and other mechanisms are emerging to mitigate this volatility. Scalability Issues: Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin in its early days, have faced scalability challenges in processing a large volume of transactions. However, technological advancements are addressing these issues. Education and Awareness: Widespread adoption requires greater education and awareness about cryptocurrencies and their benefits among businesses and consumers. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Financial Landscape For businesses and individuals looking to navigate this evolving financial landscape, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in both global trade and the cryptocurrency space. Follow reports from institutions like VanEck and stay updated on regulatory changes. Explore Crypto Payment Solutions: Businesses involved in international trade should explore integrating cryptocurrency payment solutions to potentially reduce costs, increase efficiency, and mitigate risks associated with traditional financial systems. Consider Bitcoin as a Hedge: In an environment of dollar weakness and geopolitical uncertainty, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Educate Yourself: Invest time in understanding the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This knowledge will be crucial for making informed decisions in the future. Conclusion: Embracing the Inevitable Shift? VanEck’s report paints a compelling picture of how tariff tensions are acting as an unexpected catalyst for crypto payment adoption . While challenges remain, the potential benefits – from reduced transaction costs to greater financial independence – are undeniable. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as alternative settlement tools and hedges against uncertainty is likely to become increasingly significant.

This development is significant as Atkins has promised to provide regulatory clarity for the industry, which was lacking under past Chair Gary Gensler’s administration. US Senate Confirms Paul Atkins As SEC Chair In an X post , Journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that the US Senate has confirmed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. The Upper Chamber voted 52 to 44 in favor of Atkins’ nomination for the SEC role. Pro-Bitcoin and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis also confirmed this development, sharing her excitement about Atkin’s confirmation as the SEC Chair. The Senator revealed her discussion with him about digital asset legislation and affirmed that she is confident that his leadership will bring positive change. As CoinGape reported, Paul Atkins had promised during his nomination hearing to prioritize providing regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. The incoming SEC Chair also promised to repair the Commission’s image following Gensler’s infamous regulation-by-enforcement approach. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of the top crypto exchange , Coinbase, also congratulated Atkins on his confirmation. He stated that more progress is “sorely needed” after four years of regress. One Final Step Before The Swearing In Terrett revealed that the US Senate will send Paul Atkins’ confirmation to the White House, where US President Donald Trump will sign off on it. Once that happens, the president will swear him in as the next US SEC Chair. However, it remains unclear when exactly this will happen. In the meantime, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda would continue at the helm of affairs. The Commission has planned a roundtable for April 11, which would focus on crypto trading. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce remarked that hearing the public’s concerns and suggestions helps the Commission “create a clear, sensible, and fair path forward for the crypto industry.” The post US Senate Confirms Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins As SEC Chair appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News|paul atkins|US SEC|US SEC Chair,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-10 00:12:53

The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF would seek to track the price of the memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), according to the firm’s April 9 Form S-1 registration statement. The Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, plans to assist 21Shares with marketing the fund. 21Shares said Coinbase Custody would be the proposed custodian of its Dogecoin ETF but did not specify a fee, ticker or what stock exchange it would list on. Source: James Seyffart 21Shares must also file a 19b-4 filing with the SEC to kickstart the regulator's approval process for the fund. DOGE currently has a $24.2 billion market cap and is the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by value. It was created in 2013 as a joke and is a fork of Lucky Coin, which itself is a fork of Bitcoin. 21Shares’ proposed Dogecoin ETF is the company’s latest effort to expand its spot crypto ETF offerings, which currently includes only a spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) fund. The issuer also filed with the SEC in February to launch a spot Polkadot ( DOT ) ETF and last year, it filed to create a spot XRP ( XRP ) ETF. Related: Dogecoin millionaires are buying dips as DOGE price eyes 30% rally The recent surge in crypto ETF filings reflects a “spaghetti cannon approach” from issuers testing which products the new SEC leadership might approve, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in February. “Issuers will try to launch many many different things and see what sticks,” Seyffart said. Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in February that there is a 75% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Dogecoin ETF this year, while the betting platform Polymarket currently gives approval odds of 64%. 21Shares and House of Doge partner for DOGE funds in Switzerland 21Shares also said on April 9 that it partnered with House of Doge to launch a fully backed Dogecoin exchange-traded product on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange. The 21Shares Dogecoin product will trade under the ticker “DOGE” with a 2.5% fee. 21Shares president Duncan Moir said that Dogecoin “has become more than a cryptocurrency: it represents a cultural and financial movement that continues to drive mainstream adoption, and DOGE offers investors a regulated avenue to be part of this exciting project.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-10 00:16:44

A top White House official is boldly proclaiming that a golden age for digital assets could be unleashed under a Trump administration. Bo Hines, chairman of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, has ignited excitement in the crypto community with his recent statements. Could this be the dawn of a new era for crypto in the United States? Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of digital currencies. Is Trump the Crypto President Ushering in a Golden Age? Bo Hines didn’t mince words when he took to X (formerly Twitter) to declare President Donald Trump as the true crypto president . This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a signal of a potentially dramatic change in approach towards digital assets in the US. Hines argues that under Trump’s leadership, the United States is poised to enter a ‘golden age’ for crypto and other groundbreaking financial technologies. This statement is a stark contrast to the current regulatory environment and hints at a future where innovation in the digital asset space might be not just tolerated, but actively encouraged. Here’s a breakdown of Hines’ key points: Trump as the ‘Crypto President’: Hines positions Trump as a champion for the crypto industry, suggesting a deep understanding and support for its growth. Golden Age Promise: The claim of a ‘golden age’ implies a period of significant growth, innovation, and perhaps less restrictive regulation for the crypto sector. Critique of Biden Administration: Hines alleges that crypto companies have been unfairly targeted by a ‘weaponized judicial system’ under the current administration, suggesting a hostile regulatory environment. What Does a Crypto Golden Age Actually Mean for Digital Assets? The term ‘ golden age ‘ is certainly attention-grabbing, but what could it realistically entail for the world of digital assets ? For crypto enthusiasts and businesses, this phrase conjures up images of reduced regulatory burdens, clearer legal frameworks, and a government that fosters rather than hinders innovation. Let’s consider some potential benefits: Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: A golden age could mean a move away from what many in the industry perceive as regulation by enforcement. Clearer rules and guidelines could attract more investment and encourage growth. Innovation Hub: With a more supportive stance, the US could become a global hub for crypto innovation, attracting talent and businesses from around the world. Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector can create jobs, spur technological advancements, and contribute significantly to the economy. Mainstream Adoption: Less hostile policies could pave the way for wider mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology across various sectors. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that a ‘golden age’ isn’t just about deregulation. It also necessitates responsible growth, consumer protection, and addressing legitimate concerns around illicit activities. The challenge lies in finding the right balance. Navigating Crypto Regulation: A Trump vs. Biden Comparison The current narrative from Hines paints a picture of stark contrast between potential crypto regulation under Trump and the existing policies under Biden. While the Biden administration has focused on investor protection and combating illicit finance in the crypto space, leading to increased scrutiny and enforcement actions, the Trump camp seems to be signaling a more industry-friendly approach. Here’s a simplified comparison: Aspect Biden Administration (Perceived) Potential Trump Administration (Projected) Regulatory Focus Investor protection, combating illicit finance, increased scrutiny Innovation, economic growth, potentially lighter regulatory touch Industry Perception Seen as restrictive and sometimes hostile Potentially more supportive and encouraging Enforcement Actions Increased, with focus on compliance and alleged violations Potentially reduced, with focus on fostering growth Overall Tone Cautious, emphasizing risks Optimistic, emphasizing opportunities It’s important to note that these are perceptions and projections based on current statements and trends. Actual policies and outcomes can be complex and influenced by various factors. The Future of US Crypto Policy: What to Expect? Looking ahead, the direction of US crypto policy remains a critical question for the global digital asset market. Hines’ statements suggest a significant potential shift if Trump were to regain the presidency. This could have far-reaching implications not only for the US crypto industry but also for the global landscape, influencing how other countries approach digital asset regulation. Key questions to consider: Will Regulation Ease? Could we see a rollback of some current regulations or a shift towards a more permissive regulatory framework? Innovation Boom? Would a Trump administration actively promote crypto innovation through policy and incentives? Global Impact? How would a US ‘golden age’ for crypto affect international crypto markets and regulatory trends? Balancing Innovation and Protection? Can a Trump administration strike the right balance between fostering growth and ensuring consumer protection and financial stability? The answers to these questions will unfold over time, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto policy in the US is heating up, and the potential for significant change is palpable. The prospect of a ‘golden age’ under a Trump presidency is a powerful narrative that has undoubtedly captured the attention of the crypto world. Conclusion: A New Dawn or Just a Promise? Bo Hines’ bold pronouncements have injected a surge of optimism into the crypto community. The idea of a ‘golden age’ for digital assets under a Trump administration is certainly compelling for those who feel stifled by current regulations. Whether this vision becomes reality remains to be seen. However, it’s undeniable that the political winds are shifting, and the future of crypto in the United States could be on the cusp of a significant transformation. Keep a close watch on developments in US crypto policy – the next chapter could be truly groundbreaking.

A new report from CryptoQuant, shared via X, paints a compelling picture of Binance’s growing dominance in the spot trading arena, leaving competitors in its wake. Let’s dive into the numbers and analyze what this powerful trend means for the crypto landscape. Binance Spot Trading Volume: A Deep Dive into Dominance The numbers don’t lie. According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, the overall spot trading volume for Bitcoin and altcoins has seen a significant decrease since February 3rd. Spot Bitcoin trading volume plummeted from a robust $44 billion to a more modest $10 billion. Similarly, altcoin spot trading volume experienced a sharp decline, shrinking from $122 billion to $23 billion. This market-wide contraction makes Binance’s performance even more noteworthy. Here’s where Binance’s crypto exchange dominance truly shines: Bitcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s share of the Bitcoin spot trading volume reached an impressive 49% during this period of market decline. Nearly half of all spot Bitcoin trades are happening on Binance. Altcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s grip on altcoin trading is even stronger. The exchange commands a staggering 64% of the total altcoin spot trading volume. That’s almost two-thirds of the entire market! Competitor Contraction: While Binance’s share has surged, the volume accounted for by its competitors has noticeably decreased. This indicates a clear shift in market share towards Binance. Why is Binance Solidifying its Spot Trading Lead? What factors are contributing to Binance’s growing market share in spot trading? Several elements likely play a crucial role: Liquidity: Binance is renowned for its deep liquidity. Traders flock to exchanges where they can execute large orders quickly and efficiently without significantly impacting prices. High liquidity attracts more volume, creating a positive feedback loop. Variety of Trading Pairs: Binance offers an extensive selection of trading pairs, including a vast array of altcoins. This caters to a wide range of traders with diverse investment strategies. User Experience: Binance’s platform is generally considered user-friendly, with a robust trading interface, comprehensive charting tools, and mobile accessibility. A seamless user experience can be a significant draw for both novice and experienced traders. Global Reach: Binance operates globally, serving users in numerous countries. This broad reach expands its potential user base and trading volume. Reputation and Trust: Despite facing regulatory challenges in some jurisdictions, Binance has built a strong brand reputation and a degree of trust within the crypto community, particularly for its trading capabilities. Bitcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Near Half-Share The fact that Binance captures nearly half of the Bitcoin trading volume is a testament to its strength in the flagship cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin remains the most traded cryptocurrency, and Binance’s dominance here underscores its position as a primary venue for Bitcoin transactions. This substantial Bitcoin volume contributes significantly to Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Altcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Commanding Two-Thirds Binance’s control over altcoin trading volume is even more pronounced, reaching almost two-thirds of the market. Altcoins, with their higher volatility and diverse narratives, often attract speculative trading interest. Binance’s extensive altcoin listings and deep liquidity in these pairs make it the go-to platform for altcoin traders. This dominance in the altcoin space further solidifies Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Is Binance’s Dominance a Threat or a Benefit to the Crypto Market? The question arises: is Binance’s increasing crypto exchange dominance a positive or negative development for the broader cryptocurrency market? Potential Benefits: Increased Liquidity: Binance’s dominance can concentrate liquidity, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient trading conditions for users on its platform. Platform Stability and Innovation: As a leading exchange, Binance has the resources to invest in platform stability, security, and innovation, potentially benefiting the entire ecosystem. Potential Challenges: Centralization Risks: Concentrated market share in one exchange raises concerns about centralization. If Binance were to face significant issues (regulatory, technical, or security-related), it could have a disproportionate impact on the market. Reduced Competition: Excessive dominance could stifle competition among exchanges, potentially leading to fewer choices and less innovation in the long run. Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance’s size and influence attract increased regulatory attention, which could lead to compliance burdens and operational challenges. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders For crypto traders, Binance’s spot trading dominance has several implications: Liquidity Access: Binance remains a prime destination for accessing deep liquidity, especially for Bitcoin and a wide range of altcoins. Price Discovery: Prices on Binance can be highly influential in the broader market due to its significant trading volume. Traders should monitor Binance’s price action closely. Diversification Considerations: While Binance offers advantages, traders should also consider diversifying their exchange usage to mitigate risks associated with relying heavily on a single platform. Conclusion: Binance’s Reign in Spot Trading Binance’s deepening dominance in spot trading is undeniable. As Binance spot trading volume continues to outpace competitors, the exchange is solidifying its position as a central hub in the cryptocurrency market. While this dominance brings both potential benefits and challenges, it’s a trend that demands close attention from traders, regulators, and the crypto industry as a whole. The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and Binance’s ability to maintain and expand its lead will be a key factor shaping the future of crypto trading.

In a closely watched vote, the Senate has moved to advance Paul Atkins’ nomination to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development, confirmed by Crypto In America host Eleanor Terrett on X, signals a potential shift in how digital assets will be governed in the United States. With a final confirmation vote potentially on the horizon, the crypto community is keenly observing what this could mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Why is Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination a Hot Topic in Cryptocurrency Regulation? Paul Atkins is not a new face in the realm of financial regulation. Having previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, Atkins brings a wealth of experience to the table. His nomination is particularly noteworthy for the cryptocurrency industry, a sector that has been navigating a complex and often unclear regulatory environment. But why is this nomination generating so much buzz, and what could it mean for the future of digital assets? Here’s a breakdown of why Atkins’ nomination is significant: Experience Matters: Atkins’ prior tenure at the SEC provides him with deep insights into the workings of the commission and the intricacies of securities law. This experience could translate into a more informed and nuanced approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Potential Policy Shift: Depending on Atkins’ stance on digital assets (which we will delve into further), his confirmation could signal a shift in the SEC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. This could range from stricter enforcement to a more accommodating framework. Market Impact: Regulatory clarity is crucial for the growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Atkins’ presence on the SEC could influence the direction of regulations, impacting investor sentiment, market innovation, and the overall trajectory of the digital asset space. Investor Protection: A key mandate of the SEC is investor protection. Atkins’ views and policies will likely play a role in how the SEC aims to protect investors in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. Decoding the Senate Vote: What Does 51-45 Mean for the SEC Nomination? The Senate vote of 51-45 to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC nomination is a procedural step, but a crucial one. It indicates that there is enough support in the Senate to move forward with the nomination process. However, the relatively close margin also suggests that there is some level of opposition or at least reservations regarding his appointment. Let’s break down what this vote signifies: Vote Outcome Implication 51-45 Advance Vote Indicates sufficient support to proceed with the nomination. A final confirmation vote is likely to follow. Close Margin Suggests potential opposition or debate surrounding the nomination. The final vote may also be closely contested. Possible Confirmation Vote Soon As indicated by Eleanor Terrett, a final confirmation vote could happen quickly, possibly even on the same day or in the immediate future. The narrow margin underscores the politically charged environment surrounding financial regulation and potentially differing views on the approach to cryptocurrency oversight within the Senate. Paul Atkins and Cryptocurrency: What are His Stances? To understand the potential impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on cryptocurrency regulation, it’s essential to examine his past statements and positions on digital assets. While direct quotes specifically addressing cryptocurrency might be less readily available from his time as SEC Commissioner (given the nascent stage of crypto then), we can infer potential approaches based on his broader regulatory philosophy and statements on related topics. Here’s what we can glean: Free Market Principles: Atkins is generally considered to be a proponent of free markets and limited government intervention. This perspective could suggest a potentially less heavy-handed regulatory approach to cryptocurrency, favoring innovation and market-driven solutions. Rule of Law and Clarity: A consistent theme in Atkins’ public statements has been the importance of clear rules and regulations. For the cryptocurrency space, which often grapples with regulatory ambiguity, this could be a positive sign. Clear guidelines could foster compliance and encourage institutional investment. Investor Protection Focus: While advocating for less burdensome regulation, Atkins, like all SEC Commissioners, is bound by the mandate to protect investors. His approach might involve focusing on disclosure and anti-fraud measures rather than overly restrictive rules that stifle innovation. Technology Neutrality: A potential approach consistent with free market principles is technology neutrality. This would mean applying existing securities laws to cryptocurrencies based on their characteristics and functions, rather than creating entirely new and separate regulatory frameworks just for digital assets. It’s important to note that these are inferences. The actual policies and positions Atkins might take as an SEC Commissioner in 2024, especially concerning the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, will need to be observed after his potential confirmation. Impact on the Crypto Market: Navigating the New Regulatory Horizon The immediate and long-term impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on the cryptocurrency market is a subject of intense speculation and analysis. While predicting the future is impossible, we can consider potential scenarios and factors that will shape the market’s response. Potential Positive Impacts: Regulatory Clarity: If Atkins champions clearer regulatory guidelines, this could reduce uncertainty in the market, encouraging institutional investment and broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Innovation-Friendly Environment: A less restrictive regulatory approach could foster innovation within the crypto space, allowing new projects and technologies to flourish in the US. Market Maturity: Clear and sensible regulations can contribute to the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, making it more stable and attracting a wider range of participants. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Enforcement Actions: Even with a potentially less interventionist approach, the SEC will still be responsible for enforcing securities laws in the crypto space. Companies must remain vigilant about compliance. Global Regulatory Landscape: US regulations are just one piece of the puzzle. The cryptocurrency market is global, and international regulatory coordination will be crucial for long-term stability and growth. Evolving Technology: The pace of innovation in cryptocurrency is rapid. Regulations need to be adaptable to keep up with technological advancements without stifling progress. What’s Next After the Senate Advances the SEC Nomination? Following the Senate’s move to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination, the next steps are crucial and could unfold rapidly. Here’s a likely timeline and what to watch for: Final Confirmation Vote: As reported, a final confirmation vote could take place very soon. This vote will determine whether Atkins is officially confirmed as an SEC Commissioner. Senate Debate (Possible): Even after the advance vote, there could be further debate on the Senate floor before the final vote. This debate could offer more insights into senators’ views on Atkins and cryptocurrency regulation. SEC Commissioner Role: If confirmed, Atkins will assume his role as an SEC Commissioner. The immediate impact will depend on the existing agenda of the SEC and how quickly Atkins can influence policy. Policy Announcements and Actions: Over time, we can expect to see policy announcements, enforcement actions, and regulatory guidance emerging from the SEC that reflect the perspectives of the commissioners, including Atkins. For those in the cryptocurrency industry and investors, staying informed about these developments is paramount. Monitoring SEC announcements, statements from commissioners, and expert analysis will be key to navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Cryptocurrency and Regulation The Senate’s advancement of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. While the final outcome and long-term impacts are still unfolding, this development signals a potential shift in the regulatory winds. For the cryptocurrency community, this is a time to pay close attention, engage in informed discussions, and prepare for the evolving regulatory horizon. Whether this nomination leads to a more innovation-friendly or a more stringent regulatory environment remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: cryptocurrency regulation is entering a new and crucial chapter.

Last around $0.63, the Cardano price is up a stunning 23% from its Monday lows around $0.50. The US President announced a 90-day pause on the implementation of new tariffs on some countries on Wednesday. Good news!

And Trump backing off from at least some of his tariff threats was just the catalyst traders needed to close out some shorts, and for dip buyers to flood back into the market. Could this be the start of a new Cardano price rally back to its December highs in the $1.30 area? Where Next for the Cardano Price – Back to All-time Highs? The impressive Wednesday rally has some traders asking if the Cardano price might now have bottomed, and a return to late-2024 highs might be on the cards. Well, an easing of trade war concerns and the fact that the market got so bearish and oversold earlier this week suggest that a local low is likely in. A choppy continued recovery could well extend in the coming days, assuming no new trade war escalation headlines rock sentiment once again. Of course, that’s no guarantee, as the trade war between the US and China continues to heat up, even if things are cooling off with other nations. Macro could also throw spanners in the works. Still too hot inflation, which could rise further as tariff affects creep through, and a robust labor market are preventing the Fed from being able to ease to support falling markets and a slower economy.

Gonna be… pic.twitter.com/LHfUqwf52y — World War Bitcoin (@WWBitcoin) April 9, 2025 With money markets currently pricing 100bps of easing by the year’s end, per the CME’s Fed Watch Tool , there is a risk that hot inflation data disappoints the market and risk appetite is hurt. And US treasury markets continue to send disturbing signals, with the US 10-year yield having jumped 45bps from earlier weekly lows to around 4.30% as of early Thursday overnight trade. With US long-dated yields still well above 4.0%, investors will be disappointed by the lack of downside in US bond yields despite the meaningful correction in US stock markets in recent weeks. All said, it remains a complicated backdrop for risk assets. Investors, retail or institutional, are unlikely to feel confident enough to pile back into crypto’s like Cardano anytime soon. Cardano Back to $0.30? Bearish technicals and a lack of any notable Cardano specific narratives further increase the risk of further price downside in the near-future. Cardano has seen a decent bounce from recent weekly lows, but remains in an overall downtrend, and remains substantially below all of its major moving averages. Meanwhile, all of the hype that Cardano would somehow be one of the major beneficiaries of the arrival of a pro-crypto Trump administration hasn’t come to anything yet. Cardano hasn’t been selected as the blockchain to run Treasury payments on top of. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson didn’t make it into Trump’s inner circle of crypto advisors. Yet the Cardano price still remains around 2x above its pre-Trump election victory levels. A worsening backdrop in the months ahead coupled with a continued deflation of retail hype, suggests the Cardano price could continue to ebb lower back to its mid-2024 range in the $0.20s-40s. One theme to watch: Ripple and Cardano appear to be cooking up some sort of collaboration. It remains to be seen whether this will yield any bullish results for either crypto.

The pullback has deepened over the past two months, with Bitcoin trading between $75,000 and $79,000 in April. The bullish prospect is becoming very weak, and the crypto sector is searching for technical clarity amidst a buildup of pressure across traditional markets, especially with equities. Given the situation, crypto analyst Tony Severino noted that the current setup offers one major move that could invalidate an extended bearish momentum. Tony “The Bull” Identifies Important LMACD Inflection Point To Reject Bearish Hypothesis According to Tony “The Bull” Severino, the most important chart development is the incoming bearish crossover on Bitcoin’s 1-month LMACD indicator. The LMACD, which tracks market momentum on a logarithmic scale, currently shows the blue line drifting toward a crossover beneath the orange signal line. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Reveals Why The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over With Crash Below $80,000 This kind of intending crossover is known to be an important bearish confirmation, and its appearance has coincided with growing weakness across broader markets, including traditional indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Although the crossover has not yet been confirmed by a monthly close, its presence at the open of April is enough to stir concern. Severino explained that unless a significant rally occurs before the end of the month, the blue line will cross below the orange line, and momentum will officially turn bearish. If the month closes with the crossover intact, it will mark the first confirmed bearish momentum shift on the LMACD since the bullish reversal in July 2023. Bitcoin Bulls Still Have A Window To Flip The Outlook Before April Ends According to Tony Severino, this crossover is not the sole reason for leaning bearish on Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory, but it stands out as the most precise technical marker that could trigger a rethink. The crossover isn’t isolated to the Bitcoin price chart. Severino highlighted that the same bearish crossover was already confirmed last month in major indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Interestingly, the crossover has already shown up in the BTCUSD versus GOLD chart, further supporting the idea that Bitcoin is no longer moving in isolation but reacting to widespread macro pressures. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price 1-Month Stochastic: Expert Warns Investors To Stop Comparing BTC To 2017 Moves Despite the bearish tilt, the situation is not yet final. The current crossover is provisional, meaning there’s still time for bulls to reverse the signal. A powerful upward move this month could cause the blue LMACD line to diverge higher, reestablish upward momentum and invalidate the bearish setup before it solidifies. The analyst also noted this possibility of a rebound considering the current oversold levels. This is because oversold technical conditions generally creates the kind of environment where a dramatic reversal is possible. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $77,260, down by 2.23% and 8.93% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

43146648,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147966,1744246853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Progress: US Legislators Advance Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-regulation-legislative-progress/,"Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States! If you’re invested in digital assets or closely following the crypto space, you’ll want to pay close attention to the recent strides made by U.S. legislators. The buzz is all about the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, which has been actively working on shaping the future of crypto regulation . Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you. What’s the Latest on US Crypto Legislation? The House Financial Services Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee recently convened a hearing that’s generating significant optimism. The core purpose? To openly discuss and refine proposed legislation concerning cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just talk; it’s about laying the groundwork for clear and effective rules for the digital asset market. According to reports from CoinDesk, key figures are expressing confidence in the progress being made. Here’s a quick rundown of the key highlights from the hearing: Bipartisan Effort: The discussions are happening across party lines, suggesting a growing consensus on the need for US crypto legislation . Focus on Clarity: The aim is to create a regulatory framework that provides clarity for businesses and investors in the crypto space. Stakeholder Engagement: Lawmakers are actively collaborating with various stakeholders to ensure the legislation is robust and practical. Stablecoin Bill: A Priority for the Trump Administration? One of the most talked-about pieces of potential US crypto legislation is the stablecoin bill. Why is this significant? Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value (often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar), are crucial for facilitating transactions within the crypto ecosystem. Chairman Bryan Steil of the House Financial Services Committee Digital Assets Subcommittee revealed some interesting insights during the hearing: Top Priority: Steil indicated that the stablecoin bill is a high priority, potentially even one of the initial goals for the Trump administration. This suggests strong political will behind moving this legislation forward. Smooth Progress: He described the progress on the stablecoin bill as “smooth,” implying that legislative hurdles are being overcome effectively. This is encouraging news for those seeking regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Market Structure Legislation: Strengthening the Crypto Framework Beyond stablecoins, the broader market structure legislation is another critical area of focus. This legislation aims to establish a comprehensive framework for how the crypto market operates, covering aspects like exchanges, custody, and trading. Chairman French Hill of the House Financial Services Committee emphasized the collaborative approach being taken: Refinement and Strengthening: Chairman Hill stated that the committee is actively working with various stakeholders to “refine and strengthen” the market structure legislation. This indicates a commitment to creating well-thought-out and effective regulations. Collaborative Approach: Engaging with stakeholders is vital. It ensures that the legislation considers diverse perspectives and addresses real-world challenges faced by the crypto industry. Why is Crypto Regulation Important? Unlocking the Potential of Digital Assets You might be wondering, why all this focus on crypto regulation ? Well, clear and well-designed regulations are essential for the sustainable growth and mainstream adoption of digital assets . Here’s why it matters: Benefit Explanation Investor Protection Regulation can help protect investors from fraud and manipulation within the crypto market, fostering greater trust and confidence. Market Stability Clear rules can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing volatility and encouraging institutional investment. Innovation and Growth A well-defined regulatory framework can actually foster innovation by providing businesses with the certainty they need to invest and build in the crypto space. Mainstream Adoption For cryptocurrencies to truly go mainstream, they need to operate within a recognized and regulated system, making them more accessible and acceptable to a wider audience.
