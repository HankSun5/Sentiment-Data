A swearing-in ceremony will soon put the former SEC commission in charge of the high-profile regulator — a matter cheered on by the digital assets sector that sees him as a strong ally after his significant background advising crypto firms as a financial-services consultant in Washington. Atkins' Senate confirmation was easily cleared on Wednesday in a 52-44 vote. The longtime figure in U.S. financial policy — both in government and as an outside adviser — was generally expected to easily move through confirmation, though the Senate Banking Committee approved Atkins along party lines , with all the panel's Democrats opposing the nominee. Atkins' confirmation took the usual months to emerge from the Senate, and in the time between the departure of predecessor Gary Gensler and Atkins' arrival, Trump's interim agency chief, Mark Uyeda, carried out an ambitious and rapidly deployed crypto overhaul. The SEC has thrown out almost all of its high-profile digital assets enforcement actions, and its staff quickly outlined a number of segments of the industry that it considers outside its jurisdiction — including some stablecoins, memecoins (such as the president's own $TRUMP) and proof-of-work mining. Many of the areas in which the agency has already demonstrated policy shifts overlap with Trump's family crypto businesses, including the family's memecoins and its ties to World Liberty Financial, which has pursued its own stablecoin. Atkins will be taking over those issues to apply permanent standards, potentially directed by future legislation that's now a priority in Congress. Atkins' tenure will begin with an incomplete commission, which is meant to have five members and whose sole Democrat — Caroline Crenshaw — is occupying an already expired term. The White House hasn't yet moved to fill the two Democratic positions on the commission.",Policy|Top Stories|Breaking News|Paul Atkins|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Senate,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 23:50:11
43144401,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147928,1744242627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking $1B US Fine Looms for TSMC in Huawei AI Chip Export Control Storm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-fine-tsmc-huawei-ai-chip/,"The tech world is buzzing with news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a giant in chip manufacturing, could be facing a monumental US fine . Reports suggest this penalty could reach a staggering $1 billion or more. The reason? A US export control investigation linked to a chip allegedly made by TSMC and used in a Huawei AI processor. This development, initially reported by Reuters, has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and technology sectors, raising questions about international trade and technological sovereignty. Why is the US considering a fine against TSMC? The core of the issue revolves around potential violations of US export control regulations. Let’s break down what we know: The Allegations : The investigation centers on a chip manufactured by TSMC that reportedly found its way into Huawei’s advanced Ascend 910B AI processor. The Players : Key entities involved are TSMC, Huawei, and Xiamen Sophgo Technologies (Sophgo), a Chinese chip designer affiliated with Bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain. The Timeline : This situation first surfaced in late 2024, with investigations unfolding into 2025. According to reports, the chip in question was designed by Sophgo and manufactured by TSMC. It’s then alleged that this Sophgo chip was incorporated into Huawei’s Ascend 910B AI chip . This multi-layered arrangement is crucial because Huawei’s processor is considered a cutting-edge piece of technology, especially for being produced in China. The estimated production runs into hundreds of thousands of units, amplifying the potential scale of the export control breach. TSMC, in response to these allegations, stated, “TSMC is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” They further emphasized their proactive communication with the U.S. Commerce Department and commitment to compliance. Timeline of Events: Unpacking the TSMC-Huawei-Sophgo Situation To better understand the gravity of this potential US fine , let’s look at a timeline of key events: Date Event Significance October 2024 TechInsights, a Canadian research firm, disassembles Huawei’s 910B AI processor. Discovery of a TSMC-based chipset inside, resembling a Sophgo design, triggering initial concerns. November 2024 U.S. Department of Commerce orders TSMC to halt advanced chip shipments to Chinese customers, including Sophgo. Escalation of US scrutiny and direct impact on TSMC’s business with Chinese firms. December 2024 U.S. Commerce Department considers adding Sophgo to the U.S. blacklist. Increased pressure on Sophgo and further tightening of export controls. January 2025 U.S. adds over twenty Chinese companies, including Sophgo and Zhipu AI, to the blacklist. Formal blacklisting of Sophgo, restricting its access to US technology and markets. What’s at Stake for TSMC and the Chip Industry? The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is not just about the money. It carries significant implications: Financial Impact : A billion-dollar fine is substantial, even for a company as large as TSMC. It could impact their profitability and future investments. Reputational Damage : Allegations of export control violations can tarnish TSMC’s reputation as a trusted global chip manufacturer. Geopolitical Ramifications : This incident underscores the escalating tensions in the global technology race, particularly between the US and China. It highlights the complexities of supply chains and international regulations in the semiconductor industry. Industry-Wide Alert : This case serves as a stark reminder for all chip manufacturers about the stringent enforcement of export controls and the need for meticulous compliance. Huawei ‘s Role and the Tech Cold War Huawei , at the center of this controversy, has been a focal point of US-China tech tensions for years. The US government has repeatedly expressed concerns about Huawei’s technology and its potential national security implications. The alleged use of TSMC-manufactured chips in Huawei’s AI processor further intensifies this ongoing tech cold war. For Huawei , securing advanced AI chips is crucial for maintaining its competitiveness in the global market. Despite US sanctions, Huawei has shown resilience and continues to innovate. This situation underscores the immense pressure on Chinese tech companies to achieve self-sufficiency in critical technologies like semiconductors. Export Control Compliance: A New Era for Tech Companies? This unfolding situation with TSMC emphasizes the critical importance of export control compliance for tech companies operating globally. The regulations are complex and constantly evolving, requiring companies to be vigilant and proactive in their compliance efforts. Key takeaways for tech companies: Robust Compliance Programs : Companies need to invest in comprehensive export control compliance programs. Due Diligence : Thorough due diligence is essential to ensure adherence to all applicable regulations. Transparency and Communication : Open communication with regulatory authorities is crucial when potential issues arise. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for TSMC, Huawei, and US-China Tech Relations? The outcome of the US fine investigation into TSMC will be closely watched by the global tech industry. It will not only impact TSMC and Huawei but also set precedents for how export controls are enforced in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and semiconductor technology. As the investigation progresses, the industry braces for potential shifts in supply chains, compliance strategies, and the delicate balance of US-China tech relations. The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is a stark reminder of the high stakes in the global tech arena. It highlights the intricate web of international regulations, technological innovation, and geopolitical tensions that define the modern semiconductor industry. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech investors alike, this saga underscores the interconnectedness of global technology policy and market dynamics.

As of 8th of April 2025 , Solana trades at $107 , XRP at $1.75 , Ethereum at $1,520 , and MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.0002772 in its presale. While the first three leverage established ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5.5 million presale raise and $5 target—a 71,329% ROI—could outshine them all by 2025 . Solana: A 500% Gain to $642? Solana, at $107 after a 10% dip in 7 days , is a favorite for its 4,000 transactions per second and $5 billion DeFi TVL across 1,000+ projects. Its 8,000% growth since 2021 shows promise. Coinpedia forecasts $1,000 by 2025 , an 834% gain, turning $100 into $934 . A 500% gain requires $642 , achievable by late 2025 , per X posts, if Solana’s NFT and gaming sectors grow. However, its $50 billion market cap (adjusted for $107 price) and competition from layer-1s like Aptos ( $2 billion TVL) may cap its upside in a bearish market. XRP: Targeting $10.50 for 500%? XRP, down 15% to $1.75 as of 7th of April 2025 , benefits from its SEC settlement on 25th of March 2025 , reducing a $125 million fine to $50 million . Its 1,500 transactions per second at 0.00001 XRP per transaction and 300+ financial partnerships drive adoption. Bitnation predicts $12 by 2026 , but some X posts see $10 by 2025 , a 471% gain, making $100 worth $571 . A 500% gain needs $10.50 , possible by 2025 if ETF approvals materialize, though its $118 billion market cap and RLUSD competition ( $170 million cap) pose challenges. Ethereum: 500% to $9,120 in Reach? Ethereum, at $1,520 after a 15% drop in 7 days , boasts a 619,116% historical ROI and $182 billion market cap (adjusted for $1,520 price). Its layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( $1.5 billion TVL) and 1,000+ dApps fuel growth. Analysts on X predict $10,000 by 2025 , a 558% gain, turning $100 into $658 . A 500% gain requires $9,120 , possible by 2025 , per Changelly, if tokenization and staking ( $100 billion locked) accelerate. Ethereum’s gas fees ( $2.50 average) and competition from Solana may slow its path to 500% in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Rising Star Analysts Predict Could Deliver 18,500% Returns 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $5.5 million , with Phase 7 at 80% sold out as of 5th of April 2025 . Priced at $0.0002772 , its listing price of $0.007 offers a 2,500% ROI—already surpassing 500% . Analysts forecast $5 by 2025 , a 71,329% gain from listing. A $100 investment buys 360,750 tokens, worth $2,500 at listing and $1.8 million at $5 . A 500% gain is hit at just $0.00166 , a fraction of its target. With a 100% Hashex audit, DeFi lending at 20%+ yields, and 50,000 supporters growing by 12,000 weekly across 30+ countries, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 1,570.6% presale rise from Stage 1 sets it apart. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshines the Pack Solana ( $642 ), XRP ( $10.50 ), and Ethereum ( $9,120 ) need 500% gains that their large market caps ( $50 billion , $118 billion , $182 billion ) make tough in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 target and 71,329% potential—already 2,500% at listing—leverage a smaller cap. Its $5.5 million raise, against XRP’s $1.5 million weekly inflow, shows stronger retail faith. A $100 investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE hits $10K at $0.027 , a 100x , making 500% a mere milestone.

Last month, the DeFi project announced plans to launch a new stablecoin called USD1, which it says is pegged to the US dollar and backed by short-term government treasuries, dollar deposits and cash equivalents. Now, World Liberty wants to test its on-chain airdrop feature by distributing a small amount of USD1 to all current WLFI token holders. In a new proposal , the project says the final exact amount will be based “on total eligible wallets and budget.” Explains World Liberty, “Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1.” World Liberty notes in the fine print on its website that President Donald Trump is not an officer, director, founder, or employee of the firm or any of its affiliates, but the company does name the president as the “Chief Crypto Advocate.” World Liberty’s website also states that DT Marks DEFI LLC, an entity affiliated with Trump and some of his family members, holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens and is entitled to receive fees from the project.

The ETF, trading under the ticker XXRP, achieved this milestone as cryptocurrency markets faced widespread selling pressure. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the performance “very respectable” given the current bearish market conditions.

The price briefly recovered to over $1.87 on Tuesday before falling again to $1.69 by evening. Even with these unstable price movements, Teucrium moved forward with its ETF launch, aiming to give investors a way to profit from price swings in either direction. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 New XRP ETF Outperforms Similar Solana Product Based on reports from Bloomberg’s Balchunas, the XXRP ETF’s first-day trading volume was about four times higher than what Solana’s similar 2x ETF saw on its launch day. This performance puts Teucrium’s product in the top 5% of all new ETF launches. However, the $5.43 million figure still pales in comparison to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF debut, which saw trading volume roughly 200 times larger. Community Shows Interest Despite Broad Market Losses The altcoin community has responded positively to the ETF launch, especially considering the harsh market conditions. Data shows that 137,000 traders faced liquidations in the 24 hours surrounding the launch, with total losses exceeding $413 million across cryptocurrency markets. Some XRP supporters have suggested that while XXRP’s volume was much smaller than BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a potential spot ETF (which some have dubbed “IXRP”) could provide stronger competition. How The 2x XRP ETF Works And Its Risks Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold the underlying asset, Teucrium’s XXRP does not invest directly in XRP tokens. Instead, it’s designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP’s price movements, which amplifies both gains and losses for investors. Related Reading: XRP Dump? Not So Fast—Software Engineer Says Panic Selling Makes No Sense Community figure Crypto Eri warned about the ETF’s built-in risk factors, noting that even if XRP’s price stays flat, volatility alone could cause significant losses. For example, if XRP experiences 25% volatility, XXRP holders could see a 6% loss. With 70% volatility, those losses could balloon to 40%. The launch comes as more than 10 asset managers have filed applications with the SEC for spot XRP ETFs. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications, though BlackRock has not yet expressed interest in launching an XRP-specific ETF product.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently addressed the Ways & Means Committee, making a statement that has reverberated across economic and political circles. According to reports from Walter Bloomberg X account, Greer indicated that President Donald Trump’s authority to impose tariffs is not without boundaries. This revelation sparks crucial questions about the future of US trade policy and the balance of power within the U.S. government. Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal announcement and explore its potential ramifications. What Did the Trade Representative Reveal About Trump’s Tariff Authority? Jamieson Greer’s appearance before the Ways & Means Committee was closely watched, especially given the Trump administration’s assertive approach to trade and tariffs. His statement, as reported, directly addresses the extent of presidential power in this domain. Here’s a breakdown of what we understand: Not Unlimited Power: The core message is clear – the President’s authority to apply tariffs is not absolute. This suggests there are checks and balances in place, even in matters of trade, which are often considered under executive purview. Congressional Oversight: Greer’s testimony before the Ways & Means Committee itself highlights the role of Congress in overseeing trade policy. The committee’s questioning and Greer’s responses underscore the legislative branch’s interest and influence in this area. Legal and Constitutional Framework: The notion of limited authority implies that tariff decisions are likely subject to a legal and constitutional framework. This could mean that certain tariff actions could be challenged or reviewed, ensuring they align with existing laws and trade agreements. This isn’t just about semantics; it’s about the very foundation of how US trade policy is formulated and implemented. It sets the stage for a potentially more nuanced and collaborative approach to international trade relations. Why is the Scope of Presidential Tariff Authority Under Scrutiny? The question of presidential tariff authority isn’t new, but it has gained prominence in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration. Several factors contribute to this increased scrutiny: Trump Administration’s Trade Actions: President Trump frequently utilized tariffs as a tool in trade negotiations and to address perceived trade imbalances. High-profile tariff disputes with countries like China and the European Union brought the issue of tariff authority to the forefront. Economic Impact of Tariffs: Tariffs can have significant economic consequences, affecting industries, consumers, and international relations. Concerns about these impacts naturally lead to questions about the process and authority behind tariff decisions. Separation of Powers: In the U.S. system of government, the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is fundamental. Debates about tariff authority often touch upon the balance of power between the President and Congress in matters of trade. Global Trade Norms: International trade is governed by a complex web of agreements and norms. Unilateral tariff actions can sometimes clash with these norms, raising questions about the consistency and predictability of US trade policy on the global stage. Therefore, Greer’s statement can be seen as part of a broader discussion about the appropriate limits of executive power in trade, especially in a globalized economy where trade policies have far-reaching effects. The Role of the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill Understanding the context of Jamieson Greer’s statement requires looking at the roles of both the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill . The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR): Key Trade Negotiator: The USTR is the primary entity responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and commodity policy. They lead negotiations with foreign governments and represent the U.S. at international trade organizations. Advisor to the President: The Trade Representative serves as the principal trade advisor to the President. Their views and statements carry significant weight in shaping the administration’s trade agenda. Congressional Interaction: While part of the executive branch, the USTR regularly interacts with Congress, particularly committees like the Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade matters. This interaction is crucial for policy alignment and oversight. Capitol Hill and the Ways & Means Committee: Legislative Oversight: Capitol Hill , as the seat of Congress, plays a vital role in legislative oversight of executive actions, including trade policy. Committees like the Ways & Means Committee are specifically tasked with reviewing and shaping trade-related legislation. Public Forum for Debate: Congressional hearings, such as the one where Greer testified, provide a public forum for discussing and debating important policy issues. They allow for transparency and accountability in government actions. Influence on Trade Laws: Congress has the power to enact laws that can shape and constrain presidential authority, including in the area of tariffs. The Ways & Means Committee’s engagement signals a potential legislative interest in clarifying or reinforcing the limits of Trump tariff authority or any presidential tariff authority in the future. The dialogue between the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill is thus a critical part of the checks and balances system, ensuring that trade policy is not solely determined by the executive branch. Implications for Future US Trade and Global Relations Greer’s statement about the limits of Trump tariff authority has several potential implications: More Predictable Trade Policy: If presidential tariff authority is perceived as constrained, it could lead to a more predictable and stable trade policy environment. This predictability is beneficial for businesses, investors, and international partners. Increased Congressional Role: Acknowledging limits on presidential authority could empower Congress to play a more active role in shaping trade policy. This might lead to more bipartisan and consensus-based approaches to trade. Potential for Reduced Trade Tensions: If the U.S. signals a move away from unilateral tariff actions, it could help reduce trade tensions with other countries. This could foster a more cooperative global trade environment. Legal Challenges to Tariffs: The recognition of limits might also open the door for legal challenges to tariffs that are seen as exceeding presidential authority. This could create a more judicial dimension to trade policy oversight. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges: Executive Branch Pushback: Future administrations might push back against perceived limitations on their tariff authority, potentially leading to further political and legal battles. Navigating Geopolitical Tensions: Trade is often intertwined with geopolitical considerations. Limits on tariff authority could constrain the U.S.’s ability to respond assertively to unfair trade practices or geopolitical challenges. Domestic Political Pressures: Domestic industries and political groups may lobby for tariff protections, and a perceived weakening of presidential tariff power could create domestic political tensions. Actionable Insights and Looking Ahead For businesses and stakeholders involved in international trade, Greer’s statement offers several key takeaways and actionable insights: Monitor Policy Developments: Closely track further statements and actions from both the USTR and Capitol Hill regarding trade policy and tariff authority. Policy shifts can significantly impact business strategies. Assess Risk and Opportunity: Evaluate how potential changes in US trade policy might affect your supply chains, markets, and competitive landscape. Identify both risks and opportunities arising from a potentially more constrained approach to tariffs. Engage in Policy Dialogue: Participate in industry associations and engage with policymakers to voice your perspectives on trade policy. Your input can help shape future trade regulations and agreements. Prepare for Legal and Regulatory Scrutiny: Be prepared for potential legal challenges to tariff actions and increased regulatory scrutiny of trade practices. Ensure compliance and seek legal counsel when needed. The unfolding narrative around Trump tariff authority and its limitations is a crucial development in the landscape of international trade. It signals a potential shift towards a more balanced and perhaps less unilateral approach to trade policy. For those operating in the global economic sphere, understanding these nuances is not just academic—it’s essential for strategic planning and navigating the complexities of the modern trade environment. Conclusion: A New Chapter in US Trade Policy? Jamieson Greer’s statement on Capitol Hill , highlighting the limits of presidential Trump tariff authority , marks a potentially pivotal moment for US trade policy . It underscores the enduring principles of checks and balances within the U.S. government and signals a possible recalibration of trade policy away from unilateral actions towards a more collaborative and predictable framework. While the full implications will unfold over time, this development warrants close attention from anyone invested in international trade, global economics, and the evolving dynamics of power in Washington D.C. The future trajectory of US trade policy may well be shaped by this crucial acknowledgement of limitations.

BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price sunk to its lowest level in five months, dropping over 10% from last week. BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. ETH is down ~56% year to date and is ~69% below its record high from November 2021. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. XRP's is down ~23% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

The escalating trade tensions led by the U.S. are not just reshaping international commerce; they’re inadvertently fueling a surge in crypto payment adoption . VanEck, a well-regarded investment management firm, has released a compelling report highlighting this unexpected consequence of tariff wars. Let’s dive into how these global economic pressures are pushing nations and businesses towards cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Why Tariff Tensions Are a Catalyst for Crypto Payment Adoption? The core of the issue lies in the disruption of traditional financial systems. When countries impose tariffs and engage in trade disputes, the stability of fiat currencies can be called into question. VanEck’s report suggests that this instability, coupled with a desire to circumvent traditional financial rails, is making crypto payment adoption increasingly attractive. Think of it as a financial detour around roadblocks erected by trade wars. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Dollar Weakness: Continued uncertainty and trade imbalances can lead to a weakening U.S. dollar, the world’s reserve currency. This makes alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, more appealing as stores of value and mediums of exchange. Geopolitical Fragmentation: As global alliances shift and trade blocs realign, countries are seeking financial independence. Cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized, borderless solution that sidesteps traditional geopolitical constraints. Sanctions and Restrictions: Tariff wars often go hand-in-hand with sanctions. Cryptocurrencies can provide a route for nations and entities to conduct transactions outside the reach of these restrictions. Desire for Alternatives: Businesses and individuals caught in the crossfire of trade disputes may actively seek alternative payment systems to mitigate risks and ensure smooth transactions. Bitcoin : The Unexpected Beneficiary? While the cryptocurrency landscape is vast, Bitcoin is emerging as a primary beneficiary of this trend. Its established network, decentralized nature, and increasing acceptance as a store of value position it uniquely in this evolving scenario. VanEck’s report highlights specific instances where Bitcoin is gaining traction due to tariff-related pressures. Examples from the Report: China and Russia Energy Deals: Watcher Guru’s report on X indicates that China and Russia are reportedly utilizing cryptocurrencies for some energy transactions. This could be a strategic move to bypass dollar-denominated systems and mitigate the impact of potential tariffs or sanctions on energy trade. Emerging BTC Mining Hubs: Countries like Bolivia, France, and Germany are reportedly exploring Bitcoin mining and energy strategies. This suggests a proactive approach to leveraging Bitcoin, potentially as a means to attract investment, diversify energy resources, and position themselves in the burgeoning crypto economy. What Are the Potential Benefits of Crypto Payments in a Tariff-Driven World? The rise of crypto payment adoption , spurred by tariff tensions, presents several potential advantages: Reduced Transaction Costs: Cross-border transactions using traditional banking systems can be expensive and time-consuming. Cryptocurrencies can offer significantly lower fees and faster settlement times. Increased Efficiency: Crypto transactions are often processed more quickly than traditional bank transfers, streamlining international trade and payments. Greater Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide access to financial services for individuals and businesses in regions with limited banking infrastructure, fostering greater global economic participation. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies, offers enhanced security and transparency in transactions, reducing the risk of fraud and corruption. Are There Challenges to Overcome for Widespread Crypto Payment Adoption? Despite the promising outlook, widespread crypto payment adoption in international trade faces certain hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Lack of clear and consistent regulations can hinder widespread adoption by businesses and institutions. Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrency prices can be volatile, which can be a concern for businesses engaged in international trade. However, stablecoins and other mechanisms are emerging to mitigate this volatility. Scalability Issues: Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin in its early days, have faced scalability challenges in processing a large volume of transactions. However, technological advancements are addressing these issues. Education and Awareness: Widespread adoption requires greater education and awareness about cryptocurrencies and their benefits among businesses and consumers. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Financial Landscape For businesses and individuals looking to navigate this evolving financial landscape, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in both global trade and the cryptocurrency space. Follow reports from institutions like VanEck and stay updated on regulatory changes. Explore Crypto Payment Solutions: Businesses involved in international trade should explore integrating cryptocurrency payment solutions to potentially reduce costs, increase efficiency, and mitigate risks associated with traditional financial systems. Consider Bitcoin as a Hedge: In an environment of dollar weakness and geopolitical uncertainty, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Educate Yourself: Invest time in understanding the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This knowledge will be crucial for making informed decisions in the future. Conclusion: Embracing the Inevitable Shift? VanEck’s report paints a compelling picture of how tariff tensions are acting as an unexpected catalyst for crypto payment adoption . While challenges remain, the potential benefits – from reduced transaction costs to greater financial independence – are undeniable. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as alternative settlement tools and hedges against uncertainty is likely to become increasingly significant.

This development is significant as Atkins has promised to provide regulatory clarity for the industry, which was lacking under past Chair Gary Gensler’s administration. US Senate Confirms Paul Atkins As SEC Chair In an X post , Journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that the US Senate has confirmed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. The Upper Chamber voted 52 to 44 in favor of Atkins’ nomination for the SEC role. Pro-Bitcoin and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis also confirmed this development, sharing her excitement about Atkin’s confirmation as the SEC Chair. The Senator revealed her discussion with him about digital asset legislation and affirmed that she is confident that his leadership will bring positive change. As CoinGape reported, Paul Atkins had promised during his nomination hearing to prioritize providing regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. The incoming SEC Chair also promised to repair the Commission’s image following Gensler’s infamous regulation-by-enforcement approach. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of the top crypto exchange , Coinbase, also congratulated Atkins on his confirmation. He stated that more progress is “sorely needed” after four years of regress. One Final Step Before The Swearing In Terrett revealed that the US Senate will send Paul Atkins’ confirmation to the White House, where US President Donald Trump will sign off on it. Once that happens, the president will swear him in as the next US SEC Chair. However, it remains unclear when exactly this will happen. In the meantime, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda would continue at the helm of affairs. The Commission has planned a roundtable for April 11, which would focus on crypto trading.

The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF would seek to track the price of the memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), according to the firm’s April 9 Form S-1 registration statement. The Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, plans to assist 21Shares with marketing the fund. 21Shares said Coinbase Custody would be the proposed custodian of its Dogecoin ETF but did not specify a fee, ticker or what stock exchange it would list on. Source: James Seyffart 21Shares must also file a 19b-4 filing with the SEC to kickstart the regulator's approval process for the fund. DOGE currently has a $24.2 billion market cap and is the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by value. It was created in 2013 as a joke and is a fork of Lucky Coin, which itself is a fork of Bitcoin. 21Shares’ proposed Dogecoin ETF is the company’s latest effort to expand its spot crypto ETF offerings, which currently includes only a spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) fund. The issuer also filed with the SEC in February to launch a spot Polkadot ( DOT ) ETF and last year, it filed to create a spot XRP ( XRP ) ETF. Related: Dogecoin millionaires are buying dips as DOGE price eyes 30% rally The recent surge in crypto ETF filings reflects a “spaghetti cannon approach” from issuers testing which products the new SEC leadership might approve, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in February. “Issuers will try to launch many many different things and see what sticks,” Seyffart said. Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in February that there is a 75% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Dogecoin ETF this year, while the betting platform Polymarket currently gives approval odds of 64%. 21Shares and House of Doge partner for DOGE funds in Switzerland 21Shares also said on April 9 that it partnered with House of Doge to launch a fully backed Dogecoin exchange-traded product on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange. The 21Shares Dogecoin product will trade under the ticker “DOGE” with a 2.5% fee. 21Shares president Duncan Moir said that Dogecoin “has become more than a cryptocurrency: it represents a cultural and financial movement that continues to drive mainstream adoption, and DOGE offers investors a regulated avenue to be part of this exciting project.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-10 00:16:44

A top White House official is boldly proclaiming that a golden age for digital assets could be unleashed under a Trump administration. Bo Hines, chairman of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, has ignited excitement in the crypto community with his recent statements. Could this be the dawn of a new era for crypto in the United States? Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of digital currencies. Is Trump the Crypto President Ushering in a Golden Age? Bo Hines didn’t mince words when he took to X (formerly Twitter) to declare President Donald Trump as the true crypto president . This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a signal of a potentially dramatic change in approach towards digital assets in the US. Hines argues that under Trump’s leadership, the United States is poised to enter a ‘golden age’ for crypto and other groundbreaking financial technologies. This statement is a stark contrast to the current regulatory environment and hints at a future where innovation in the digital asset space might be not just tolerated, but actively encouraged. Here’s a breakdown of Hines’ key points: Trump as the ‘Crypto President’: Hines positions Trump as a champion for the crypto industry, suggesting a deep understanding and support for its growth. Golden Age Promise: The claim of a ‘golden age’ implies a period of significant growth, innovation, and perhaps less restrictive regulation for the crypto sector. Critique of Biden Administration: Hines alleges that crypto companies have been unfairly targeted by a ‘weaponized judicial system’ under the current administration, suggesting a hostile regulatory environment. What Does a Crypto Golden Age Actually Mean for Digital Assets? The term ‘ golden age ‘ is certainly attention-grabbing, but what could it realistically entail for the world of digital assets ? For crypto enthusiasts and businesses, this phrase conjures up images of reduced regulatory burdens, clearer legal frameworks, and a government that fosters rather than hinders innovation. Let’s consider some potential benefits: Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: A golden age could mean a move away from what many in the industry perceive as regulation by enforcement. Clearer rules and guidelines could attract more investment and encourage growth. Innovation Hub: With a more supportive stance, the US could become a global hub for crypto innovation, attracting talent and businesses from around the world. Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector can create jobs, spur technological advancements, and contribute significantly to the economy. Mainstream Adoption: Less hostile policies could pave the way for wider mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology across various sectors. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that a ‘golden age’ isn’t just about deregulation. It also necessitates responsible growth, consumer protection, and addressing legitimate concerns around illicit activities. The challenge lies in finding the right balance. Navigating Crypto Regulation: A Trump vs. Biden Comparison The current narrative from Hines paints a picture of stark contrast between potential crypto regulation under Trump and the existing policies under Biden. While the Biden administration has focused on investor protection and combating illicit finance in the crypto space, leading to increased scrutiny and enforcement actions, the Trump camp seems to be signaling a more industry-friendly approach. Here’s a simplified comparison: Aspect Biden Administration (Perceived) Potential Trump Administration (Projected) Regulatory Focus Investor protection, combating illicit finance, increased scrutiny Innovation, economic growth, potentially lighter regulatory touch Industry Perception Seen as restrictive and sometimes hostile Potentially more supportive and encouraging Enforcement Actions Increased, with focus on compliance and alleged violations Potentially reduced, with focus on fostering growth Overall Tone Cautious, emphasizing risks Optimistic, emphasizing opportunities It’s important to note that these are perceptions and projections based on current statements and trends. Actual policies and outcomes can be complex and influenced by various factors. The Future of US Crypto Policy: What to Expect? Looking ahead, the direction of US crypto policy remains a critical question for the global digital asset market. Hines’ statements suggest a significant potential shift if Trump were to regain the presidency. This could have far-reaching implications not only for the US crypto industry but also for the global landscape, influencing how other countries approach digital asset regulation. Key questions to consider: Will Regulation Ease? Could we see a rollback of some current regulations or a shift towards a more permissive regulatory framework? Innovation Boom? Would a Trump administration actively promote crypto innovation through policy and incentives? Global Impact? How would a US ‘golden age’ for crypto affect international crypto markets and regulatory trends? Balancing Innovation and Protection? Can a Trump administration strike the right balance between fostering growth and ensuring consumer protection and financial stability? The answers to these questions will unfold over time, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto policy in the US is heating up, and the potential for significant change is palpable. The prospect of a ‘golden age’ under a Trump presidency is a powerful narrative that has undoubtedly captured the attention of the crypto world. Conclusion: A New Dawn or Just a Promise? Bo Hines’ bold pronouncements have injected a surge of optimism into the crypto community. The idea of a ‘golden age’ for digital assets under a Trump administration is certainly compelling for those who feel stifled by current regulations. Whether this vision becomes reality remains to be seen. However, it’s undeniable that the political winds are shifting, and the future of crypto in the United States could be on the cusp of a significant transformation. Keep a close watch on developments in US crypto policy – the next chapter could be truly groundbreaking.

43145926,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147945,1744245600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unstoppable Binance: Dominates Crypto Spot Trading as Competitors Falter,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-dominates-spot-trading/,"Is Binance becoming the undisputed king of crypto spot trading? Recent data suggests a resounding ‘yes.’ As the cryptocurrency market navigates fluctuating volumes, Binance appears to be not just weathering the storm, but actually expanding its influence. A new report from CryptoQuant, shared via X, paints a compelling picture of Binance’s growing dominance in the spot trading arena, leaving competitors in its wake. Let’s dive into the numbers and analyze what this powerful trend means for the crypto landscape. Binance Spot Trading Volume: A Deep Dive into Dominance The numbers don’t lie. According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, the overall spot trading volume for Bitcoin and altcoins has seen a significant decrease since February 3rd. Spot Bitcoin trading volume plummeted from a robust $44 billion to a more modest $10 billion. Similarly, altcoin spot trading volume experienced a sharp decline, shrinking from $122 billion to $23 billion. This market-wide contraction makes Binance’s performance even more noteworthy. Here’s where Binance’s crypto exchange dominance truly shines: Bitcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s share of the Bitcoin spot trading volume reached an impressive 49% during this period of market decline. Nearly half of all spot Bitcoin trades are happening on Binance. Altcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s grip on altcoin trading is even stronger. The exchange commands a staggering 64% of the total altcoin spot trading volume. That’s almost two-thirds of the entire market! Competitor Contraction: While Binance’s share has surged, the volume accounted for by its competitors has noticeably decreased. This indicates a clear shift in market share towards Binance. Why is Binance Solidifying its Spot Trading Lead? What factors are contributing to Binance’s growing market share in spot trading? Several elements likely play a crucial role: Liquidity: Binance is renowned for its deep liquidity. Traders flock to exchanges where they can execute large orders quickly and efficiently without significantly impacting prices. High liquidity attracts more volume, creating a positive feedback loop. Variety of Trading Pairs: Binance offers an extensive selection of trading pairs, including a vast array of altcoins. This caters to a wide range of traders with diverse investment strategies. User Experience: Binance’s platform is generally considered user-friendly, with a robust trading interface, comprehensive charting tools, and mobile accessibility. A seamless user experience can be a significant draw for both novice and experienced traders. Global Reach: Binance operates globally, serving users in numerous countries. This broad reach expands its potential user base and trading volume. Reputation and Trust: Despite facing regulatory challenges in some jurisdictions, Binance has built a strong brand reputation and a degree of trust within the crypto community, particularly for its trading capabilities. Bitcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Near Half-Share The fact that Binance captures nearly half of the Bitcoin trading volume is a testament to its strength in the flagship cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin remains the most traded cryptocurrency, and Binance’s dominance here underscores its position as a primary venue for Bitcoin transactions. This substantial Bitcoin volume contributes significantly to Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Altcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Commanding Two-Thirds Binance’s control over altcoin trading volume is even more pronounced, reaching almost two-thirds of the market. Altcoins, with their higher volatility and diverse narratives, often attract speculative trading interest. Binance’s extensive altcoin listings and deep liquidity in these pairs make it the go-to platform for altcoin traders. This dominance in the altcoin space further solidifies Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Is Binance’s Dominance a Threat or a Benefit to the Crypto Market? The question arises: is Binance’s increasing crypto exchange dominance a positive or negative development for the broader cryptocurrency market? Potential Benefits: Increased Liquidity: Binance’s dominance can concentrate liquidity, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient trading conditions for users on its platform. Platform Stability and Innovation: As a leading exchange, Binance has the resources to invest in platform stability, security, and innovation, potentially benefiting the entire ecosystem. Potential Challenges: Centralization Risks: Concentrated market share in one exchange raises concerns about centralization. If Binance were to face significant issues (regulatory, technical, or security-related), it could have a disproportionate impact on the market. Reduced Competition: Excessive dominance could stifle competition among exchanges, potentially leading to fewer choices and less innovation in the long run. Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance’s size and influence attract increased regulatory attention, which could lead to compliance burdens and operational challenges. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders For crypto traders, Binance’s spot trading dominance has several implications: Liquidity Access: Binance remains a prime destination for accessing deep liquidity, especially for Bitcoin and a wide range of altcoins. Price Discovery: Prices on Binance can be highly influential in the broader market due to its significant trading volume. Traders should monitor Binance’s price action closely. Diversification Considerations: While Binance offers advantages, traders should also consider diversifying their exchange usage to mitigate risks associated with relying heavily on a single platform. Conclusion: Binance’s Reign in Spot Trading Binance’s deepening dominance in spot trading is undeniable. As Binance spot trading volume continues to outpace competitors, the exchange is solidifying its position as a central hub in the cryptocurrency market.

In a closely watched vote, the Senate has moved to advance Paul Atkins’ nomination to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development, confirmed by Crypto In America host Eleanor Terrett on X, signals a potential shift in how digital assets will be governed in the United States. With a final confirmation vote potentially on the horizon, the crypto community is keenly observing what this could mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Why is Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination a Hot Topic in Cryptocurrency Regulation? Paul Atkins is not a new face in the realm of financial regulation. Having previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, Atkins brings a wealth of experience to the table. His nomination is particularly noteworthy for the cryptocurrency industry, a sector that has been navigating a complex and often unclear regulatory environment. But why is this nomination generating so much buzz, and what could it mean for the future of digital assets? Here’s a breakdown of why Atkins’ nomination is significant: Experience Matters: Atkins’ prior tenure at the SEC provides him with deep insights into the workings of the commission and the intricacies of securities law. This experience could translate into a more informed and nuanced approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Potential Policy Shift: Depending on Atkins’ stance on digital assets (which we will delve into further), his confirmation could signal a shift in the SEC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. This could range from stricter enforcement to a more accommodating framework. Market Impact: Regulatory clarity is crucial for the growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Atkins’ presence on the SEC could influence the direction of regulations, impacting investor sentiment, market innovation, and the overall trajectory of the digital asset space. Investor Protection: A key mandate of the SEC is investor protection. Atkins’ views and policies will likely play a role in how the SEC aims to protect investors in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. Decoding the Senate Vote: What Does 51-45 Mean for the SEC Nomination? The Senate vote of 51-45 to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC nomination is a procedural step, but a crucial one. It indicates that there is enough support in the Senate to move forward with the nomination process. However, the relatively close margin also suggests that there is some level of opposition or at least reservations regarding his appointment. Let’s break down what this vote signifies: Vote Outcome Implication 51-45 Advance Vote Indicates sufficient support to proceed with the nomination. A final confirmation vote is likely to follow. Close Margin Suggests potential opposition or debate surrounding the nomination. The final vote may also be closely contested. Possible Confirmation Vote Soon As indicated by Eleanor Terrett, a final confirmation vote could happen quickly, possibly even on the same day or in the immediate future. The narrow margin underscores the politically charged environment surrounding financial regulation and potentially differing views on the approach to cryptocurrency oversight within the Senate. Paul Atkins and Cryptocurrency: What are His Stances? To understand the potential impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on cryptocurrency regulation, it’s essential to examine his past statements and positions on digital assets. While direct quotes specifically addressing cryptocurrency might be less readily available from his time as SEC Commissioner (given the nascent stage of crypto then), we can infer potential approaches based on his broader regulatory philosophy and statements on related topics. Here’s what we can glean: Free Market Principles: Atkins is generally considered to be a proponent of free markets and limited government intervention. This perspective could suggest a potentially less heavy-handed regulatory approach to cryptocurrency, favoring innovation and market-driven solutions. Rule of Law and Clarity: A consistent theme in Atkins’ public statements has been the importance of clear rules and regulations. For the cryptocurrency space, which often grapples with regulatory ambiguity, this could be a positive sign. Clear guidelines could foster compliance and encourage institutional investment. Investor Protection Focus: While advocating for less burdensome regulation, Atkins, like all SEC Commissioners, is bound by the mandate to protect investors. His approach might involve focusing on disclosure and anti-fraud measures rather than overly restrictive rules that stifle innovation. Technology Neutrality: A potential approach consistent with free market principles is technology neutrality. This would mean applying existing securities laws to cryptocurrencies based on their characteristics and functions, rather than creating entirely new and separate regulatory frameworks just for digital assets. It’s important to note that these are inferences. The actual policies and positions Atkins might take as an SEC Commissioner in 2024, especially concerning the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, will need to be observed after his potential confirmation. Impact on the Crypto Market: Navigating the New Regulatory Horizon The immediate and long-term impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on the cryptocurrency market is a subject of intense speculation and analysis. While predicting the future is impossible, we can consider potential scenarios and factors that will shape the market’s response. Potential Positive Impacts: Regulatory Clarity: If Atkins champions clearer regulatory guidelines, this could reduce uncertainty in the market, encouraging institutional investment and broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Innovation-Friendly Environment: A less restrictive regulatory approach could foster innovation within the crypto space, allowing new projects and technologies to flourish in the US. Market Maturity: Clear and sensible regulations can contribute to the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, making it more stable and attracting a wider range of participants. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Enforcement Actions: Even with a potentially less interventionist approach, the SEC will still be responsible for enforcing securities laws in the crypto space. Companies must remain vigilant about compliance. Global Regulatory Landscape: US regulations are just one piece of the puzzle. The cryptocurrency market is global, and international regulatory coordination will be crucial for long-term stability and growth. Evolving Technology: The pace of innovation in cryptocurrency is rapid. Regulations need to be adaptable to keep up with technological advancements without stifling progress. What’s Next After the Senate Advances the SEC Nomination? Following the Senate’s move to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination, the next steps are crucial and could unfold rapidly. Here’s a likely timeline and what to watch for: Final Confirmation Vote: As reported, a final confirmation vote could take place very soon. This vote will determine whether Atkins is officially confirmed as an SEC Commissioner. Senate Debate (Possible): Even after the advance vote, there could be further debate on the Senate floor before the final vote. This debate could offer more insights into senators’ views on Atkins and cryptocurrency regulation. SEC Commissioner Role: If confirmed, Atkins will assume his role as an SEC Commissioner. The immediate impact will depend on the existing agenda of the SEC and how quickly Atkins can influence policy. Policy Announcements and Actions: Over time, we can expect to see policy announcements, enforcement actions, and regulatory guidance emerging from the SEC that reflect the perspectives of the commissioners, including Atkins. For those in the cryptocurrency industry and investors, staying informed about these developments is paramount. Monitoring SEC announcements, statements from commissioners, and expert analysis will be key to navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Cryptocurrency and Regulation The Senate’s advancement of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. While the final outcome and long-term impacts are still unfolding, this development signals a potential shift in the regulatory winds. For the cryptocurrency community, this is a time to pay close attention, engage in informed discussions, and prepare for the evolving regulatory horizon. Whether this nomination leads to a more innovation-friendly or a more stringent regulatory environment remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: cryptocurrency regulation is entering a new and crucial chapter.

Last around $0.63, the Cardano price is up a stunning 23% from its Monday lows around $0.50. The US President announced a 90-day pause on the implementation of new tariffs on some countries on Wednesday. Good news! Tariffs delayed for 90 days… Let's hope for a productive resolution… pic.twitter.com/gk8U1eFebg — Mark Humphery-Jenner, PhD (@humpheryjenner) April 9, 2025 However, he increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% over the “lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets.” With Cardano , other major cryptos and stock markets having become very oversold at lows earlier this week, the market was ripe for a bounce. And Trump backing off from at least some of his tariff threats was just the catalyst traders needed to close out some shorts, and for dip buyers to flood back into the market. Could this be the start of a new Cardano price rally back to its December highs in the $1.30 area? Where Next for the Cardano Price – Back to All-time Highs? The impressive Wednesday rally has some traders asking if the Cardano price might now have bottomed, and a return to late-2024 highs might be on the cards. Well, an easing of trade war concerns and the fact that the market got so bearish and oversold earlier this week suggest that a local low is likely in. A choppy continued recovery could well extend in the coming days, assuming no new trade war escalation headlines rock sentiment once again. Of course, that’s no guarantee, as the trade war between the US and China continues to heat up, even if things are cooling off with other nations. Macro could also throw spanners in the works. Still too hot inflation, which could rise further as tariff affects creep through, and a robust labor market are preventing the Fed from being able to ease to support falling markets and a slower economy. CPI data out later this week could further highlight strengthen the case for the Fed to sit on its hands. CPI day tomorrow. Estimate is 2.8% but Truflation has us at 1.34%. I would imagine that we'll beat expectations, and yet I'm not sure the Fed will be convinced that ""they"" have ""beaten"" ""inflation"" yet, due to the fact that the tariffs haven't priced themselves. Gonna be… pic.twitter.com/LHfUqwf52y — World War Bitcoin (@WWBitcoin) April 9, 2025 With money markets currently pricing 100bps of easing by the year’s end, per the CME’s Fed Watch Tool , there is a risk that hot inflation data disappoints the market and risk appetite is hurt. And US treasury markets continue to send disturbing signals, with the US 10-year yield having jumped 45bps from earlier weekly lows to around 4.30% as of early Thursday overnight trade. With US long-dated yields still well above 4.0%, investors will be disappointed by the lack of downside in US bond yields despite the meaningful correction in US stock markets in recent weeks. All said, it remains a complicated backdrop for risk assets. Investors, retail or institutional, are unlikely to feel confident enough to pile back into crypto’s like Cardano anytime soon. Cardano Back to $0.30? Bearish technicals and a lack of any notable Cardano specific narratives further increase the risk of further price downside in the near-future. Cardano has seen a decent bounce from recent weekly lows, but remains in an overall downtrend, and remains substantially below all of its major moving averages. Meanwhile, all of the hype that Cardano would somehow be one of the major beneficiaries of the arrival of a pro-crypto Trump administration hasn’t come to anything yet. Cardano hasn’t been selected as the blockchain to run Treasury payments on top of. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson didn’t make it into Trump’s inner circle of crypto advisors. Yet the Cardano price still remains around 2x above its pre-Trump election victory levels. A worsening backdrop in the months ahead coupled with a continued deflation of retail hype, suggests the Cardano price could continue to ebb lower back to its mid-2024 range in the $0.20s-40s. One theme to watch: Ripple and Cardano appear to be cooking up some sort of collaboration. It remains to be seen whether this will yield any bullish results for either crypto.

The pullback has deepened over the past two months, with Bitcoin trading between $75,000 and $79,000 in April. The bullish prospect is becoming very weak, and the crypto sector is searching for technical clarity amidst a buildup of pressure across traditional markets, especially with equities. Given the situation, crypto analyst Tony Severino noted that the current setup offers one major move that could invalidate an extended bearish momentum. Tony “The Bull” Identifies Important LMACD Inflection Point To Reject Bearish Hypothesis According to Tony “The Bull” Severino, the most important chart development is the incoming bearish crossover on Bitcoin’s 1-month LMACD indicator. The LMACD, which tracks market momentum on a logarithmic scale, currently shows the blue line drifting toward a crossover beneath the orange signal line. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Reveals Why The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over With Crash Below $80,000 This kind of intending crossover is known to be an important bearish confirmation, and its appearance has coincided with growing weakness across broader markets, including traditional indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Although the crossover has not yet been confirmed by a monthly close, its presence at the open of April is enough to stir concern. Severino explained that unless a significant rally occurs before the end of the month, the blue line will cross below the orange line, and momentum will officially turn bearish. If the month closes with the crossover intact, it will mark the first confirmed bearish momentum shift on the LMACD since the bullish reversal in July 2023. Bitcoin Bulls Still Have A Window To Flip The Outlook Before April Ends According to Tony Severino, this crossover is not the sole reason for leaning bearish on Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory, but it stands out as the most precise technical marker that could trigger a rethink. The crossover isn’t isolated to the Bitcoin price chart. Severino highlighted that the same bearish crossover was already confirmed last month in major indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Interestingly, the crossover has already shown up in the BTCUSD versus GOLD chart, further supporting the idea that Bitcoin is no longer moving in isolation but reacting to widespread macro pressures. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price 1-Month Stochastic: Expert Warns Investors To Stop Comparing BTC To 2017 Moves Despite the bearish tilt, the situation is not yet final. The current crossover is provisional, meaning there’s still time for bulls to reverse the signal. A powerful upward move this month could cause the blue LMACD line to diverge higher, reestablish upward momentum and invalidate the bearish setup before it solidifies. The analyst also noted this possibility of a rebound considering the current oversold levels. This is because oversold technical conditions generally creates the kind of environment where a dramatic reversal is possible. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $77,260, down by 2.23% and 8.93% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

43146648,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147966,1744246853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Progress: US Legislators Advance Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-regulation-legislative-progress/,"Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States! If you’re invested in digital assets or closely following the crypto space, you’ll want to pay close attention to the recent strides made by U.S. legislators. The buzz is all about the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, which has been actively working on shaping the future of crypto regulation . Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you. What’s the Latest on US Crypto Legislation? The House Financial Services Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee recently convened a hearing that’s generating significant optimism. The core purpose? To openly discuss and refine proposed legislation concerning cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just talk; it’s about laying the groundwork for clear and effective rules for the digital asset market. According to reports from CoinDesk, key figures are expressing confidence in the progress being made. Here’s a quick rundown of the key highlights from the hearing: Bipartisan Effort: The discussions are happening across party lines, suggesting a growing consensus on the need for US crypto legislation . Focus on Clarity: The aim is to create a regulatory framework that provides clarity for businesses and investors in the crypto space. Stakeholder Engagement: Lawmakers are actively collaborating with various stakeholders to ensure the legislation is robust and practical. Stablecoin Bill: A Priority for the Trump Administration? One of the most talked-about pieces of potential US crypto legislation is the stablecoin bill. Why is this significant? Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value (often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar), are crucial for facilitating transactions within the crypto ecosystem. Chairman Bryan Steil of the House Financial Services Committee Digital Assets Subcommittee revealed some interesting insights during the hearing: Top Priority: Steil indicated that the stablecoin bill is a high priority, potentially even one of the initial goals for the Trump administration. This suggests strong political will behind moving this legislation forward. Smooth Progress: He described the progress on the stablecoin bill as “smooth,” implying that legislative hurdles are being overcome effectively. This is encouraging news for those seeking regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Market Structure Legislation: Strengthening the Crypto Framework Beyond stablecoins, the broader market structure legislation is another critical area of focus. This legislation aims to establish a comprehensive framework for how the crypto market operates, covering aspects like exchanges, custody, and trading. Chairman French Hill of the House Financial Services Committee emphasized the collaborative approach being taken: Refinement and Strengthening: Chairman Hill stated that the committee is actively working with various stakeholders to “refine and strengthen” the market structure legislation. This indicates a commitment to creating well-thought-out and effective regulations. Collaborative Approach: Engaging with stakeholders is vital. It ensures that the legislation considers diverse perspectives and addresses real-world challenges faced by the crypto industry. Why is Crypto Regulation Important? Unlocking the Potential of Digital Assets You might be wondering, why all this focus on crypto regulation ? Well, clear and well-designed regulations are essential for the sustainable growth and mainstream adoption of digital assets . Here’s why it matters: Benefit Explanation Investor Protection Regulation can help protect investors from fraud and manipulation within the crypto market, fostering greater trust and confidence. Market Stability Clear rules can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing volatility and encouraging institutional investment. Innovation and Growth A well-defined regulatory framework can actually foster innovation by providing businesses with the certainty they need to invest and build in the crypto space. Mainstream Adoption For cryptocurrencies to truly go mainstream, they need to operate within a recognized and regulated system, making them more accessible and acceptable to a wider audience. Challenges Ahead in Shaping US Crypto Legislation While the progress is encouraging, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain in the journey towards comprehensive US crypto legislation . Some of these hurdles include: Complexity of Technology: Cryptocurrency technology is complex, and crafting regulations that are both effective and technologically sound requires deep understanding and careful consideration. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The goal is to regulate the crypto space without stifling innovation. Striking this balance is a delicate act. Inter-Agency Coordination: Multiple regulatory agencies may be involved in overseeing different aspects of the crypto market, requiring effective coordination to avoid conflicting or overlapping regulations. Global Landscape: Crypto is a global phenomenon. US regulations need to consider the international landscape and aim for some level of harmonization with global standards. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what can you take away from these developments in crypto regulation ? Stay Informed: Keep following news and updates on US crypto legislation . Changes in regulations can significantly impact the crypto market. Engage in Dialogue: If you are part of the crypto industry, consider engaging with policymakers and industry associations to contribute to the regulatory conversation. Prepare for Change: Be prepared for potential changes in how the crypto market operates as new regulations are implemented. This might include adjustments to compliance procedures or business models. Conclusion: A Positive Step Forward for Crypto in the US The recent hearing and the statements from key legislators signal a positive and hopeful step forward for crypto regulation in the United States. The focus on stablecoins and broader market structure legislation, coupled with a collaborative and bipartisan approach, suggests a genuine effort to create a clear and supportive regulatory environment for digital assets . While challenges undoubtedly remain, the progress being made offers a sense of optimism for the future of the crypto industry in the US.

The new phase introduces several changes and benefits for users. The most prominent change is to the pricing of the HINU token. During the pre-launch phase, the HINU token price will increase every two days until they sell out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community, ensuring early project backers can benefit from favorable pricing. The HINU token price has already undergone one increase and is set to witness another price jump in 18 hours and 59 minutes. The Pre-Launch Phase The Husky Inu team recently announced several updates, revealing the official launch dates of the HINU token and the Earn App. According to the team, the pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy, rewarding early adopters and project supporters while maintaining growth and transparency. With the pre-launch phase underway, the HINU token’s price will increase every two days, following a compounded growth model until the tokens are sold or it reaches its presale target. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. Adverse Market Conditions The pre-launch phase begins in extremely adverse market conditions, with major cryptocurrencies in the red. After a brief recovery on Tuesday, markets were back in bearish territory on Wednesday, with volatility also experiencing a substantial uptick. Despite bearishness, BTC has climbed above $80,000 as markets plot yet another recovery. However, the recovery’s sustainability depends on the market’s reaction to China’s announcement that it is increasing tariffs on all imported US goods to 84%. The Chinese embassy in the US announced the decision on X, stating, “China will raise tariffs for all imported US goods from 34% to 84% on April 10.” The move comes after the US increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%. “The US increased the tariff rates to 104 percent on China, which fueled the uncertainty among the market participants, as expected. Bitcoin price slumped hard and is about to drop below $75,000 for the second time this week, raising alarms over the entire crypto market. Market sentiments become extremely fearful, hinting towards a potential bear market.” Meme Coins Rally Meanwhile, meme coins have rallied as market sentiment improves, with top tokens trading in positive territory over the past 24 hours, although they remain in the red over a weekly timeframe. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 10%, crossing $0.150 and trading at $0.156. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up over 8% and Pepe (PEPE) is up a staggering 14%. Bonk (BONK) is up almost 13%, while Floki (FLOKI) and Dogwifhat (WIF) are up 11.97% and 11.44%. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43147319,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147968,1744248045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking MIT AI Study: Unveiling the Truth About Machine Learning Values,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mit-ai-study-machine-values/,"Is artificial intelligence (AI) developing its own moral compass? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy readers alike, the rapid advancement of AI is both fascinating and, at times, concerning. Recent discussions have even touched upon whether AI systems are acquiring ‘values’ akin to humans, leading to speculation about AI’s priorities and potential conflicts. However, a groundbreaking new AI study from MIT throws cold water on these sensational notions, suggesting a far more nuanced reality about AI values . Does AI Truly Have Values? The MIT Study Debunks Myths Forget the headlines about AI developing complex ethical frameworks and prioritizing self-preservation over humanity. The MIT research team meticulously investigated several prominent machine learning models from tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI. Their findings? AI, as we currently understand it, doesn’t hold coherent AI values . Instead of possessing ingrained principles, these models appear to be sophisticated imitators, adept at mimicking patterns and responding to prompts, but lacking genuine, stable viewpoints. Key Takeaways from the MIT AI Study: Inconsistency is Key: The study revealed that machine learning models are remarkably inconsistent in their ‘preferences.’ Depending on how questions were phrased, the same AI could adopt wildly different stances on issues, demonstrating a lack of a fixed value system. Imitation, Not Internalization: According to Stephen Casper, a lead co-author, these models are essentially ‘imitators deep down,’ skilled at generating responses based on vast datasets, but not truly internalizing or understanding human-like preferences. Challenge to AI Alignment: The research highlights that ‘aligning’ AI – ensuring it behaves predictably and desirably – might be a significantly greater challenge than previously thought. If AI doesn’t have stable values, guiding its behavior becomes a more complex task. Why This Matters for the Future of Artificial Intelligence This MIT AI study has profound implications, especially as we navigate an increasingly AI-driven world. Understanding the true nature of artificial intelligence is crucial, particularly within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where AI is being explored for various applications, from trading algorithms to cybersecurity. Challenging the Anthropomorphic View of AI Mike Cook, an AI research fellow at King’s College London, supports the MIT team’s conclusions. He points out the common tendency to anthropomorphize artificial intelligence systems, projecting human-like qualities and intentions onto them. It’s vital to distinguish between how AI systems operate – optimizing for specific goals – and attributing human-like motivations or value acquisition to them. Describing AI behavior with overly ‘flowery’ language can lead to misinterpretations and inflated expectations. The Implications for AI Alignment and Safety The concept of AI alignment , ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human intentions and values, is a central topic in AI ethics and development. This MIT research underscores the complexity of this challenge. If AI doesn’t possess inherent, stable values, how do we ensure its long-term safety and beneficial integration into society? Key Questions Raised by the Study: Steerability Concerns: The study questioned whether AI viewpoints could be reliably ‘steered’ or modified. The inconsistent responses suggest that controlling AI behavior might be more difficult than anticipated. Stability and Extrapolability: Casper emphasizes that current machine learning models don’t adhere to assumptions of stability, extrapolability, and steerability. This unpredictability necessitates a more cautious approach to AI development and deployment. Rethinking AI Ethics: The findings prompt us to re-evaluate our approach to artificial intelligence ethics. Instead of focusing on aligning AI with pre-existing ‘values’ it may not possess, we need to concentrate on robust safety measures and ensuring predictable, beneficial outcomes. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Realities of AI So, what does this mean for you, the cryptocurrency and tech-forward reader? It’s a call for a more realistic and less sensationalized understanding of artificial intelligence . While AI offers immense potential, it’s crucial to base our expectations and development strategies on empirical evidence rather than speculative assumptions about AI sentience or inherent values. Practical Steps to Consider: Embrace Critical Thinking: Approach AI-related news and discussions with a healthy dose of skepticism. Distinguish between scientific findings and hyped narratives. Focus on Practical Alignment Strategies: Support research and development focused on verifiable methods for ensuring AI safety and predictability, rather than relying on anthropomorphic models of AI values. Promote Responsible AI Development: Advocate for ethical guidelines and regulations that prioritize transparency, accountability, and human oversight in artificial intelligence development and deployment. Conclusion: A Sobering Yet Essential Perspective on AI Values The MIT AI study delivers a vital, albeit less sensational, message: artificial intelligence , in its current form, doesn’t operate with human-like values. This isn’t necessarily a setback, but rather a crucial clarification. By understanding the true nature of machine learning models – as powerful imitators rather than value-driven agents – we can adopt more effective strategies for AI alignment , safety, and responsible innovation. This grounded perspective is essential for navigating the exciting, yet complex, future of artificial intelligence in all sectors, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

43147966,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147983,1744249234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Relief: Trump’s 90-Day Tariff Suspension Ignites Hope in Cryptocurrency Markets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariff-suspension-crypto-markets/,"In a surprising turn of events that has sent ripples through global markets, former U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed a tariff suspension lasting 90 days. This bold move, initially reported by Yonhap News, offers a temporary reprieve from reciprocal tariffs for nations agreeing not to retaliate against existing U.S. trade measures. But what does this mean for the volatile world of cryptocurrency, and could this be the economic relief the markets have been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details and unpack the potential impact of this significant announcement. Decoding the Tariff Suspension: A Beacon of Hope? The core of Trump’s proposal is straightforward: a 90-day timeout on tariffs for countries choosing not to engage in retaliatory trade actions against the United States. This isn’t just about easing trade tensions; it’s a strategic play that could have far-reaching consequences across the global trade landscape. Here’s a breakdown of what this could entail: Temporary Pause: The most immediate impact is the 90-day suspension itself. This provides businesses and economies a breather from the ongoing trade friction, allowing for potential recalibration and strategic planning. Non-Retaliation Clause: The condition of non-retaliation is crucial. It incentivizes countries to de-escalate trade disputes, potentially fostering a more cooperative international trade environment, at least temporarily. Geopolitical Implications: This move could be interpreted in various ways on the global stage – as an olive branch, a strategic maneuver, or even a sign of changing U.S. trade policy. The geopolitical ramifications are significant and worth watching closely. How Does Tariff Suspension Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? Now, let’s pivot to the question on every crypto enthusiast’s mind: how does a tariff suspension relate to cryptocurrency markets ? The connection might not be immediately obvious, but it’s deeply rooted in the broader economic climate. Here’s how: Reduced Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars and tariffs breed uncertainty. This uncertainty often leads to volatility in traditional markets and, by extension, can influence cryptocurrency markets. A tariff suspension can be seen as a step towards reducing this uncertainty, potentially stabilizing markets and fostering a more positive investment environment. Global Economic Health: Tariffs impact global economic growth. Reduced tariffs can stimulate trade, boost economic activity, and improve overall economic sentiment. A healthier global economy generally translates to increased investor confidence, which can positively affect both traditional and digital asset markets. Risk-On Sentiment: When trade tensions ease, investors may become more inclined to take on risk. Cryptocurrencies, often considered risk-on assets, could benefit from this shift in sentiment. Increased appetite for risk can drive investment into crypto, potentially leading to price appreciation. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical scenario: Scenario Impact on Global Trade Potential Cryptocurrency Market Reaction Escalating Trade Wars (No Suspension) Increased trade barriers, reduced global trade volume, economic slowdown Increased market volatility, potential flight to safety, negative pressure on risk assets like crypto 90-Day Tariff Suspension Temporary easing of trade tensions, potential for increased trade flow, economic stabilization Reduced volatility, potential for increased investor confidence, positive sentiment towards risk assets like crypto Navigating the Market Impact: What to Expect? Understanding the potential market impact of this tariff suspension is crucial for investors and market participants. While the suspension is a positive development, it’s essential to approach it with a balanced perspective. Here’s what to consider: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Effects: The 90-day suspension is, by nature, a short-term measure. While it may provide immediate economic relief and market optimism, the long-term trade policy landscape remains uncertain. Investors should be mindful that this is a temporary pause, not necessarily a permanent resolution. Market Sentiment is Key: The immediate reaction of the market will heavily depend on sentiment. If investors perceive this as a genuine step towards de-escalation and improved trade relations, we could see a positive surge in both traditional and crypto markets. However, skepticism or doubts about the sustainability of this suspension could limit its positive impact. Geopolitical Watch: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments. How other countries respond to this proposal, and whether further trade negotiations ensue, will significantly shape the long-term market impact . Any signs of renewed trade tensions could quickly reverse the positive sentiment. Seizing the Opportunity: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those in the cryptocurrency space, this tariff suspension presents both opportunities and considerations. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Reactions: Closely observe how cryptocurrency markets react to this news. Look for indicators like trading volume, price movements, and shifts in market sentiment. This will provide valuable clues about the immediate impact. Diversify Strategically: While positive news can be encouraging, diversification remains key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global trade news and geopolitical developments. The situation is fluid, and staying informed will enable you to make timely and informed investment decisions. Consider Long-Term Strategy: While short-term gains are enticing, always align your actions with your long-term investment strategy. A 90-day suspension is a temporary event; focus on building a resilient and well-thought-out long-term crypto portfolio. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air or a Fleeting Moment? Trump’s proposal for a 90-day tariff suspension is undoubtedly a noteworthy development in the realm of global trade . Whether it’s a genuine turning point or a temporary respite remains to be seen. For cryptocurrency markets , this news injects a dose of optimism and potential economic relief . However, the crypto world, much like global trade, is dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Prudence, informed decision-making, and a keen eye on evolving geopolitical landscapes will be paramount in navigating the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. This urgent development calls for careful observation and strategic positioning in the ever-exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

Just like in the crypto market where trust and verification are paramount, the AI community faces a similar challenge: ensuring the benchmarks used to evaluate AI are robust, relevant, and truly reflective of real-world performance. OpenAI, a leading force in AI innovation, recognizes this critical need and is taking a bold step forward. They’ve just launched the OpenAI Pioneers Program, a groundbreaking initiative designed to overhaul how we measure AI success, particularly in specific industries. Let’s dive into what this program entails and why it could be a game-changer for the future of AI development and adoption, impacting everything from cryptocurrency algorithms to smart contracts and beyond. Why Current AI Benchmarks Are Broken: The Urgent Need for Domain-Specific AI Evaluation For a while now, whispers of discontent have been circulating within the AI research community regarding the effectiveness of current AI benchmarks . OpenAI isn’t just joining this conversation; they are amplifying it with the launch of the Pioneers Program. The core issue? Many existing benchmarks are simply not cutting it anymore. They often focus on: Esoteric Tasks: Think of AI models acing doctorate-level math problems. Impressive? Yes. Relevant to everyday applications? Not always. These benchmarks often miss the mark when it comes to evaluating practical, real-world AI utility. Gaming the System: Some benchmarks can be ‘gamed’ or optimized for in ways that don’t truly reflect improved general intelligence or practical application. It’s like training for a very specific exam, rather than gaining a broad understanding of a subject. Misaligned Preferences: What a benchmark measures might not align with what users actually value in AI applications. Think about customer service bots – speed might be measured, but what about helpfulness and empathy? The recent stir around LM Arena and Meta’s Maverick model further highlights this problem. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to discern genuine progress and differentiate between AI models based on existing metrics. This lack of clarity is a significant hurdle as AI adoption accelerates across various sectors. Introducing the OpenAI Pioneers Program: A Revolutionary Approach to AI Benchmarks Enter the OpenAI Pioneers Program, a proactive solution aimed at creating domain-specific AI benchmarks. OpenAI’s vision is clear: to develop evaluations that truly “set the bar for what good looks like.” This program isn’t about tweaking existing benchmarks; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how we assess AI performance in real-world contexts. Here’s what makes this program stand out: Focus on Real-World Use Cases: The program will concentrate on creating benchmarks tailored to specific industries like legal, finance, insurance, healthcare, and accounting. This means evaluations will directly address the practical challenges and opportunities within these domains. Industry Collaboration: OpenAI plans to partner with multiple companies, starting with startups, to co-design these benchmarks. This collaborative approach ensures that the evaluations are grounded in real-world needs and challenges faced by businesses. Publicly Available Benchmarks: Transparency is key. The benchmarks developed through the Pioneers Program, along with industry-specific evaluations, will be made public. This open-source approach will benefit the entire AI community and foster wider adoption and improvement. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Opportunity: Participating companies will also get the chance to work with OpenAI’s experts to refine their AI models through reinforcement fine-tuning. This is a powerful technique to optimize models for specific tasks, enhancing their performance in targeted applications. The initial cohort of the Pioneers Program will specifically focus on startups. OpenAI is carefully selecting startups working on “high-value, applied use cases where AI can drive real-world impact.” This strategic focus on startups ensures that the program is working with companies at the cutting edge of AI application, fostering innovation from the ground up. The Promise of Domain-Specific AI Benchmarks: Benefits and Impact What are the potential benefits of shifting towards domain-specific AI evaluation ? The advantages are numerous and far-reaching: Benefit Description More Relevant Evaluations Benchmarks will directly assess AI performance in tasks that matter most to specific industries. For example, a legal benchmark might evaluate an AI’s ability to analyze contracts, while a financial benchmark could assess risk assessment capabilities. Improved Model Development With clearer, domain-relevant benchmarks, developers can focus their efforts on building AI models that are genuinely effective and useful in practical applications, leading to more targeted and impactful AI innovation. Faster AI Adoption Businesses will have greater confidence in adopting AI solutions when they can rely on benchmarks that accurately reflect performance in their specific industry. This can accelerate AI integration across various sectors. Enhanced Transparency and Trust Publicly available, domain-specific benchmarks will increase transparency in the AI field. This can build greater trust in AI technology among businesses and the public, fostering wider acceptance and responsible development. Imagine the implications for the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. AI benchmarks tailored for finance could revolutionize the development of AI-powered trading algorithms, risk management systems for DeFi platforms, or even smart contract auditing tools. By having clear, industry-relevant metrics, innovation in these areas can be significantly accelerated and made more reliable. Navigating the Ethical Tightrope: OpenAI’s Role and Community Trust However, the OpenAI Pioneers Program isn’t without its potential challenges and ethical considerations. The big question looming is: Will the AI community fully embrace benchmarks created and funded by OpenAI? While OpenAI has a history of supporting benchmarking efforts, the fact that they are partnering directly with customers to release these AI evaluation tools raises some eyebrows. Concerns might arise around: Perceived Bias: Will benchmarks developed in collaboration with OpenAI’s partners be seen as inherently biased towards OpenAI’s technologies or preferred approaches? Ensuring impartiality and objectivity will be crucial. Conflict of Interest: Can OpenAI, as a major AI developer, be seen as a neutral and objective entity in setting industry-wide benchmarks? Transparency in the benchmark development process and clear governance structures will be essential to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. Community Ownership: For benchmarks to be widely adopted and trusted, the AI community needs to feel a sense of ownership. OpenAI will need to foster open collaboration and ensure that the program doesn’t appear to be a top-down initiative dictated solely by OpenAI. Addressing these ethical considerations head-on will be critical for the success and widespread acceptance of the OpenAI Pioneers Program. Building trust within the AI community will be just as important as the technical robustness of the benchmarks themselves. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards More Meaningful AI Evaluation The OpenAI Pioneers Program represents a significant and potentially transformative step in the evolution of AI benchmarks . By focusing on domain-specific AI evaluations and fostering collaboration with industry partners, OpenAI is attempting to address a critical gap in the current AI landscape. If successful, this initiative could lead to more relevant, reliable, and ultimately more useful AI models across a wide range of industries, including the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. While ethical considerations and community trust need careful navigation, the potential benefits of this program for the future of AI innovation are undeniable. It’s a bold move that could redefine how we measure AI progress and unlock new levels of real-world impact.

Bitcoin trades around $82,000, facing resistance at the 20-day EMA at $82,213. The altcoin market cap excluding BTC shows signs of a reversal to $1 trillion. The cryptocurrency market has been showing signs of increased strain this week with several factors weighing heavily on sentiment: ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, persistently negative derivative funding rates, and declining altcoin momentum. What Are Funding Rates Signaling? Data from Coinglass shows a consistent trend of negative or near-zero funding rates across both centralized (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX).

Here’s what this could mean for the asset. XRP Investors Younger Than Six Months Have Significantly Increased Realized Cap Share In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the Realized Cap of XRP has changed recently. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the total amount of capital that the holders of the asset as a whole have invested into it. Changes in this metric, therefore, correspond to inflows and outflows that the cryptocurrency is observing. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Realized Cap for XRP over the last few years. As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Realized Cap has shot up during the past few months, implying that a large amount of capital has flown into the cryptocurrency. More specifically, the asset has seen the metric double from around $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion. In the same chart, Glassnode has also attached the data of the indicator for the young investor age groups. It would appear that the capital held by cohorts like 1-month to 3 months and 3 months to 6 months has spiked recently, which makes sense considering the growth in the aggregated Realized Cap has come during these windows. According to the analytics firm, this short-term capital spike is a sign of retail-led momentum. The momentum appears to have cooled off, however, as the metric has no longer been growing as sharply recently. A consequence of all the fresh capital inflows is that XRP has seen a shakeup in investor dominance. As another chart shared by Glassnode shows, the new investors, comprising all the age bands under 6 months, have witnessed their Realized Cap share blow up. Prior to the new inflows, this cohort controlled just 23% of the cryptocurrency’s Realized Cap, but today that value has grown to 62.8%. This means that 62.8% of the entire capital invested into the coin has come at price levels of the last six months. Given that XRP is currently trading under the prices that it has been at for most of this window, a lot of these holders would be underwater. “This rapid concentration in new holders reflects strong retail involvement – but also raises the risk of fragility, as many hold elevated cost bases,” notes the analytics firm. From the chart, it’s apparent that these are the same conditions that led to a top during the last two bull markets. With inflows slowing down as the price declines, it’s possible that the same pattern may once again be forming for XRP.

The digital asset world is buzzing with a dramatic legal showdown. First Digital Trust (FDT), a prominent Hong Kong-based crypto custodian and the issuer of the FDUSD stablecoin, has officially launched a defamation lawsuit against none other than Justin Sun, the founder of TRON. This isn’t just another day in crypto – this is a high-stakes battle with potentially significant repercussions for the industry. Let’s dive into what’s unfolding and what it all means. Why is First Digital Trust Launching a Defamation Lawsuit Against Justin Sun? The root of this legal storm lies in recent statements made by Justin Sun. He publicly cast doubts on the financial stability of First Digital Trust, suggesting the company was insolvent. These allegations, made across social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), sent ripples through the crypto market, particularly impacting FDUSD. For FDT, these claims weren’t just noise; they were a direct attack on their reputation and business. Defamation, in legal terms, is the act of damaging someone’s reputation through false statements, and that’s precisely what FDT alleges Sun has done. Here’s a breakdown of the key events leading to the defamation lawsuit : Justin Sun’s Allegations: Sun publicly raised concerns about First Digital Trust’s solvency. FDUSD De-pegging: Following Sun’s statements, FDUSD, the stablecoin issued by FDT, experienced a temporary de-pegging from its intended 1:1 USD value, indicating market concern. FDT’s Response: First Digital Trust vehemently denied the insolvency claims and initiated legal action. Summons Filed: FDT officially filed a summons with the Hong Kong High Court, marking the first formal step in the defamation lawsuit . Seeking Injunction: Beyond monetary damages, FDT is seeking an injunction to prevent Justin Sun from making further statements that they deem defamatory. What Does Justin Sun Say About the Lawsuit? Justin Sun , known for his active social media presence and often controversial statements, has responded to the lawsuit with characteristic nonchalance. He stated via X (Twitter) that he “welcomes any legal process.” This seemingly unfazed reaction suggests Sun is prepared to fight the allegations and potentially use the legal proceedings to further his narrative. However, the implications of a formal defamation lawsuit are serious, and Sun’s public bravado might not fully reflect the legal challenges ahead. The Impact on FDUSD and the Crypto Market The immediate aftermath of Justin Sun’s solvency concerns was the de-pegging of FDUSD. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. A de-pegging event erodes trust in the stablecoin and can trigger wider market instability. While FDUSD has since recovered its peg, the incident highlights the vulnerability of stablecoins to reputational attacks and the significant market influence figures like Justin Sun wield. Let’s consider the potential ripple effects: Impact Area Description FDUSD Stability The lawsuit and its outcome will directly impact the perceived stability and trustworthiness of FDUSD. A win for FDT could reinforce confidence; a loss or prolonged battle could create lasting uncertainty. Investor Confidence in First Digital Trust The lawsuit is essentially a fight for FDT’s reputation. Positive resolution can solidify their standing as a reliable crypto custodian ; negative outcomes could damage their credibility. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment High-profile legal battles within the crypto space can contribute to market volatility and uncertainty. This lawsuit adds to the ongoing narrative of regulatory scrutiny and potential instability within the industry. Stablecoin Regulation Debate Events like FDUSD’s de-pegging, triggered by public statements, could fuel further discussions and regulatory focus on stablecoin issuers and the need for stricter oversight. What are the Potential Outcomes of the Defamation Lawsuit? Predicting the outcome of a legal battle is always complex, but we can consider a few potential scenarios for this defamation lawsuit : FDT Wins: The court could rule in favor of First Digital Trust, ordering Justin Sun to cease making defamatory statements and potentially awarding damages to FDT. This would be a significant victory for FDT, reinforcing their reputation and potentially setting a precedent against spreading misinformation in the crypto space. Justin Sun Wins: If Sun successfully defends against the defamation lawsuit , it could embolden him and others to be more outspoken about their criticisms of crypto entities. This scenario might raise concerns about the limits of free speech versus the protection of business reputations in the crypto industry. Settlement: Often, legal battles are resolved through settlements. FDT and Justin Sun could reach an agreement outside of court, which might involve Sun retracting his statements, issuing a public apology, or other terms. A settlement could offer a quicker resolution but might leave some questions unanswered. Prolonged Legal Battle: These types of lawsuits can drag on for months or even years. A protracted legal fight would keep the uncertainty hanging over FDT and FDUSD, and continue to generate headlines, potentially impacting market sentiment. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Users and Investors Watch For? This defamation lawsuit is more than just a spat between two crypto figures. It offers valuable lessons and points to watch for: Monitor Court Proceedings: Keep an eye on updates regarding the lawsuit in the Hong Kong High Court. The court hearings and any rulings will provide crucial insights into the legal arguments and the direction of the case. FDUSD Performance: Track FDUSD’s performance closely. While it has re-pegged, continued scrutiny and market sentiment will influence its stability. Be aware of potential volatility and manage your holdings accordingly. Social Media Influence: This case underscores the immense power of social media and influential figures in the crypto world. Be critical of information spread online, especially when it comes to financial claims. Always do your own research (DYOR). Stablecoin Risks: Remember that even stablecoins are not entirely risk-free. Reputational risks, regulatory changes, and market events can all impact their stability. Diversification and understanding the underlying mechanisms of stablecoins are crucial. Conclusion: A Crypto Showdown with Far-Reaching Implications The defamation lawsuit between First Digital Trust and Justin Sun is a landmark event in the crypto industry. It highlights the growing tensions, the high stakes involved in reputation management, and the potential legal ramifications of public statements in this rapidly evolving space. Whether you’re an investor, a crypto enthusiast, or simply an observer, this legal battle is worth watching. It’s a powerful reminder that even in the decentralized world of crypto, traditional legal principles and reputational integrity still hold significant sway. The outcome will not only shape the future of FDT and FDUSD but could also set important precedents for how disputes are handled and how information is disseminated within the crypto ecosystem.

With the help of modern messaging apps like WhatsApp, paying for cross-border calls and texts is now obsolete. For money transfers, stablecoins might do just that: democratize the payments industry by eliminating historical gatekeepers, says venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). ""Just as WhatsApp disrupted costly international phone calls, blockchain payments and stablecoins are transforming global money transfers,"" the firm said in a blog post on Wednesday . The current global payment infrastructure is a complex web involving points of sale, payment processors, acquiring banks, issuing banks, correspondent banks, foreign exchanges, and card networks. Read more: What Is a Stablecoin? To make matters more difficult, each of these intermediaries charges fees and introduces delays, making international transactions cumbersome. For instance, a16z says remittance fees can reach up to 10% — just like cross-border calls or text used to be restrictive before instant messaging apps came into play. Enter blockchain and stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. ""Stablecoins offer a clean-slate alternative. Instead of stitching together clunky, costly, and outdated systems, stablecoins flow seamlessly on top of global blockchains,"" the blog post said. ""Already, stablecoins are slashing the cost of remittances: Sending $200 from the U.S. to Columbia using traditional methods will cost you $12.13; with stablecoins, it costs $0.01."" And, it's not just remittances where stablecoins are eliminating inefficiencies; this could help boost B2B payments on a massive scale, too. A16z uses business transactions from Mexico to Vietnam as an example, which take three to seven days to process and cost anywhere between $14-to-$150 per $1000 transacted. These pass through as many as five intermediaries along the way, each of which takes a cut. The adoption of stablecoin could make such transactions nearly free and instant, it says. Some corporations have taken notice, and Elon Musk's SpaceX is already using stablecoins to manage their corporate treasuries to shield itself from FX volatility. So, it shouldn't surprise anyone to see that the total market cap of stablecoins has passed $200 billion or that the annualized transaction value of stablecoins in 2024 hit $15.6 trillion — roughly 119% and 200% that of Visa and Mastercard , respectively. However, the rise of stablecoins isn't without challenges. Regulatory bodies have scrutinized their use, making it ""incredibly difficult"" to bridge traditional finance to stablecoins, said a16z. The landscape is now finally evolving, as policymakers are now actively shaping rules to recognize and regulate stablecoins in the U.S. ""A forthcoming bill clarifying this regulation could pave the way for even broader adoption and integration into the global financial system,"" the blog said. With the rapidly changing landscape for finance and crypto becoming more mainstream, stablecoins could become the transformative force that revolutionizes the future of money.

43148934,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147998,1744251024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlocking Blockchain Innovation: US Treasury Eyes Positive Crypto Regulation Review,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-treasury-blockchain-regulation-review/,"Exciting news for the crypto community! The winds of regulatory change might be blowing in favor of blockchain and stablecoins in the United States. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently hinted at a significant shift, suggesting a re-evaluation of existing blockchain regulations that could be stifling innovation. This move signals a potentially more welcoming environment for the burgeoning cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of crypto and the broader financial landscape. Why is the US Treasury Reviewing Blockchain Regulations Now? Secretary Bessent’s announcement at the American Bankers Association conference underscores a growing recognition within the Trump administration of the transformative potential of blockchain technology and stablecoins regulation . The current regulatory framework, while intended to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, may inadvertently be hindering the very innovation it should be nurturing. Several factors are likely driving this re-evaluation: Global Competition: Other nations are actively exploring and implementing crypto-friendly regulations to attract blockchain businesses and investment. The U.S. risks falling behind in this technological race if it maintains overly restrictive policies. Economic Growth Imperative: The administration’s focus on economic growth aligns perfectly with the potential of blockchain and crypto to create new industries, jobs, and investment opportunities. Streamlining regulations could unlock significant economic benefits. Financial Inclusion Goals: Bessent specifically mentioned financial inclusion as a priority. Blockchain and stablecoins offer the promise of expanding access to financial services for underserved populations, a key objective for any administration aiming for broad-based economic prosperity. Industry Advocacy: The cryptocurrency industry has been consistently advocating for clearer and more innovation-friendly regulations. This persistent dialogue seems to be finally resonating with policymakers. What are the Potential Benefits of Reforming Blockchain Regulations? A more balanced regulatory environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation could unleash a wave of positive outcomes for the U.S. economy and its citizens: Boost to Innovation: Clearer guidelines and reduced regulatory hurdles will encourage entrepreneurs and businesses to build and deploy blockchain-based solutions in the U.S., fostering a vibrant ecosystem of innovation. Increased Investment: Regulatory clarity attracts investment. Both domestic and international investors will be more inclined to pour capital into U.S.-based crypto ventures if the rules of the game are well-defined and supportive. Job Creation: A thriving blockchain industry translates directly into job creation across various sectors, from software development and cybersecurity to legal and compliance. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins and blockchain-based payment systems can offer cheaper, faster, and more accessible financial services, particularly for those excluded from traditional banking. Global Leadership in Fintech: By embracing blockchain innovation, the U.S. can solidify its position as a global leader in financial technology, shaping the future of finance on the world stage. Challenges and Considerations for New Regulations While the prospect of regulatory reform is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that policymakers must address to ensure a responsible and effective framework: Challenge Consideration Investor Protection: Regulations must safeguard investors from fraud and scams in the often-volatile crypto market. Money Laundering and Illicit Finance: Robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures are essential to prevent the misuse of cryptocurrencies. Financial Stability: The regulatory framework needs to ensure that the growth of stablecoins and other crypto assets doesn’t pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. Clarity and Consistency: Regulations should be clear, consistent, and applied uniformly across different states and federal agencies to avoid confusion and compliance burdens. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The key is to strike a balance – regulations should be robust enough to address risks but flexible enough to allow innovation to flourish. Scott Bessent and the US Treasury’s Stance Secretary Bessent’s remarks at the American Bankers Association conference offer a glimpse into the US Treasury ‘s evolving perspective on crypto. His emphasis on reviewing regulations that may hinder innovation, coupled with the administration’s broader goal of benefiting both Wall Street and Main Street, suggests a pragmatic and forward-looking approach. The focus on financial inclusion further highlights a commitment to ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements are shared widely. According to Crypto Briefing’s report, Bessent specifically stated that the administration is pursuing reforms for the benefit of U.S. capital markets and aims to create a more balanced regulatory environment. This signals a potential shift away from a purely enforcement-focused approach towards a more proactive and supportive stance towards responsible blockchain regulations and innovation. What Does This Mean for Stablecoins Specifically? Stablecoins regulation is a particularly hot topic within the crypto regulatory landscape. These digital assets, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, have the potential to revolutionize payments and remittances due to their stability and efficiency. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns among regulators regarding their potential impact on monetary policy and financial stability. A positive regulatory review could pave the way for clearer guidelines on: Reserve Requirements: Defining appropriate reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers to ensure they are fully backed by the assets they claim to hold. Issuance and Redemption: Establishing clear rules for the issuance and redemption of stablecoins to maintain transparency and prevent market manipulation. Regulatory Oversight: Determining which agencies should have primary oversight of stablecoin issuers and their activities. If the US Treasury adopts a more supportive stance on stablecoins regulation , it could unlock their potential for mainstream adoption and significantly impact the global payments landscape. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those in the crypto space and traditional finance, here are some actionable insights and things to watch out for in the coming months: Treasury Department Reports: Keep an eye out for any reports or white papers released by the US Treasury regarding their review of blockchain and stablecoin regulations. These documents will provide valuable insights into the administration’s thinking and potential policy changes. Legislative Developments: Monitor legislative activity in Congress related to cryptocurrency and blockchain. New bills or amendments to existing laws could signal the direction of regulatory reform. Agency Guidance: Pay attention to pronouncements and guidance from regulatory agencies like the SEC, CFTC, and FinCEN. These agencies will play a crucial role in implementing any new regulatory framework. Industry Consultations: Engage in industry consultations and discussions with policymakers to contribute to the development of sensible and innovation-friendly regulations. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for Crypto’s Future Secretary Bessent’s announcement is undoubtedly a positive and promising development for the cryptocurrency industry. The US Treasury’s willingness to re-evaluate blockchain regulations and stablecoins regulation suggests a growing understanding of the technology’s potential and a desire to foster responsible cryptocurrency innovation . While the specifics of any regulatory changes remain to be seen, this shift in tone from a key government agency offers a beacon of hope for a more constructive and supportive regulatory environment in the United States. This could pave the way for the next wave of growth and adoption in the crypto space, solidifying the U.S.’s position in the global fintech arena.

As a result, the FDUSD stablecoin briefly de-pegged on April 3 following Sun’s accusations . However, it has since virtually recovered. Moreover, the company requested an injunction to prevent Sun from publishing “similar words” to statements regarding insolvency. First Digital Trust takes Justin Sun’s remarks seriously and files a lawsuit against him Earlier, Tron’s founder Justin Sun initially shared an X post claiming First Digital was insolvent. In addition, he held a press conference in Hong Kong late last week where he accused the company of fraud. This pushed the First Digital Trust to file a lawsuit against Justin Sun for defamation over insolvency allegations. The summons writ, the initial stage of a defamation lawsuit submitted late last week, asked the Hong Kong High Court to grant an order prohibiting Sun from speaking about the issue in the future. Additionally, the company requested an injunction compelling Sun to take back what he previously stated. In addition, First Digital Trust requested the court to issue an award for damages, without stating the exact amount, for causing damage to Plaintiff’s business and unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s contractual and business relationships. An initial court hearing date had not yet been established. Sun did not respond to this; however, he shared an X post that he favored any legal action . Furthermore, Sun’s spokesperson remained silent on the issue. Notably, HCA 680 was the case number in the High Court of Hong Kong. FDT claims that the FDUSD stablecoin has proven to be resilient Following earlier accusations, Sun also mentioned that First Digital Trust also broke Hong Kong’s securities laws. On April 3, FDT stated in a statement on X that they vehemently deny any and all allegations that FDT participated in a coordinated scheme or misappropriation of funds. In the meantime, First Digital reassured customers that it was solvent and that FDUSD was still fully backed and redeemable. Moreover, FDT claimed that Sun and Techteryx, the company that issues the TrueUSD stablecoin, were trying to shift the blame and avoid their responsibilities to manage TUSD reserves appropriately. Based on FDT’s argument, “Techteryx and Justin Sun’s suggestion of First Digital Trust being insolvent is not only factually incorrect, but it is a malicious attempt to damage the reputation and market standing of FDT and stablecoin.” Interestingly, after Justin Sun accused First Digital of being insolvent, the FDUSD depreciated, dropping as low as $0.87. However, the company has since redeemed almost $26 million of stablecoins. Furthermore, First Digital shared another X post highlighting that they kept processing redemptions without issues, proving the FDUSD’s resilience.

With headlines breaking about token unlocks and big-name protocol updates, it’s getting harder to tell which coins are worth the hype and which ones are all smoke. Aptos is staring down the barrel of a major token unlock, while Injective is rolling out tech upgrades that should’ve pumped the price—but didn’t. Things are heating up, and folks in the crypto community are watching closely for the next breakout move. That’s where the hunt for the top cryptos to join for 2025 gets serious. Now, while the usual suspects are scrambling to maintain their footing, a new name is quietly building the rails for blockchain’s next big evolution— Qubetics ($TICS). It isn’t just adding another chain or promising a flashy feature. Qubetics is rewriting how blockchains work together entirely. This Web3 aggregator is stitching networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into one frictionless experience. And it’s not just theory—Qubetics is already deep into its presale with real momentum building. The tech? Game-changing. The price entry? Still early. Let’s break it down. Qubetics Is Solving Blockchain’s Worst Headaches in One Unified System Blockchains are cool—until you try getting them to talk to each other. Right now, a logistics company using Ethereum can’t seamlessly share data with a payment processor running on Solana. A dev building on Avalanche might hit a wall trying to deploy cross-chain smart contracts. And casual users? Forget it. Juggling wallets, interfaces, and swap bridges is enough to push people away. Qubetics solves this nightmare by functioning as a universal Web3 translator. It doesn’t just connect chains—it aggregates them into one smooth ecosystem. This is why Qubetics stands tall among the top cryptos to join for 2025. By eliminating data silos, reducing scalability constraints, and enforcing tight interoperability standards, Qubetics empowers everyone—from NFT artists and DeFi developers to corporate backend engineers—to build, deploy, and operate across multiple blockchains like it’s all one platform. No more friction, no more tech dead-ends. Just clean, user-friendly integration built for how Web3 was always supposed to work. Qubetics Presale: The Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 Are Selling Fast If you’ve been waiting for the right presale to make a move—this is it. The Qubetics presale is now in its 29th stage, and the current price is $0.1573 per $TICS token. With each stage lasting only seven days and ending every Sunday at 12 am sharp, that price rises by 10% like clockwork. Over 507 million $TICS have already been sold, with 24,500+ token holders and a presale tally crossing $15.9 million. That’s not hype—that’s momentum, and it’s building fast ahead of Qubetics’ mainnet launch in Q2 2025. Let’s get real with the numbers. If you get in now and $TICS hits just $1 post-presale, you’re looking at a 535.65% return. At $5? You’re in the 3,078.26% ROI zone. But things get wilder—at $10, that jumps to a jaw-dropping 6,256.47%, and at $15, we’re talking 9,434.71%. For example, a $100 entry right now could earn you $9,540 if $TICS reaches $15. That’s why the Qubetics presale isn’t just another offering—it’s being watched closely by anyone serious about the top cryptos to join for 2025 and looking for that breakout return in the best crypto presale opportunity. Injective’s Major Q1 Upgrades Fall Flat on Price Action Injective has been shipping major tech updates, but the market’s just not responding—yet. In Q1 2025, Injective rolled out native Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support and launched its new Injective AI Index. This index brings together top AI tokens like FET and RNDR along with legacy equity assets like Meta and Nvidia, which is a big step toward integrating traditional markets into DeFi. Still, despite these solid moves, Injective’s price has taken a dive. As of April 8, the coin trades at $7.22, with a 12.64% dip in 24 hours and a full 19.07% drop over the last week. Technical analysis shows bearish pressure isn’t letting up. The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) just crossed below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)—a red flag for momentum. It gets worse: trading volume is shrinking, showing fading interest, and the token now sits in the deep oversold zone. After peaking earlier in the year, Injective’s breakout in January couldn’t hold, and prices have been drifting downward ever since. The protocol’s tech is evolving fast, but the market hasn’t caught up—yet. Aptos Faces Pressure Ahead of $47M Token Unlock Aptos has one of the most anticipated events this week in crypto—and not in the way many hoped. On April 12, it’s scheduled to unlock a whopping $47 million worth of tokens. The problem? That fresh supply could trigger heavy sell-offs from early buyers looking to cash out, potentially driving down the price even further. Token unlocks always shake things up, but when the dollar value is this high, it sends ripples across the market. There’s no sugarcoating it—this kind of unlock could seriously test Aptos’ short-term strength. The community is on edge, watching for signs of a price dip or a mass exodus of liquidity. While Aptos continues to innovate under the hood, the unlock timing has cast a shadow on its momentum. Whether it rebounds post-unlock will depend on how much of that supply actually hits exchanges and how resilient its ecosystem proves under pressure. Why These Coins Matter in the 2025 Crypto Race So what’s the verdict? Injective is dropping major updates but still battling bearish pressure. Aptos has exciting development activity but is caught in the crosshairs of a massive unlock event. Then there’s Qubetics—quietly but powerfully solving blockchain’s biggest usability and interoperability challenges, while building serious traction with a strategic, limited-time presale. If you’re mapping out your next move and eyeing the top cryptos to join for 2025, Qubetics might just be the one project that’s got both the tech and timing in its favor. This could be your best chance to join this best crypto presale before $TICS makes its leap post-mainnet. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics, and how does it work? Qubetics is a Web3 aggregator designed to unify blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into a single, seamless network—allowing for easier, faster, and more secure data exchange. Why is Qubetics considered one of the top cryptos to join for 2025? Because it solves real-world issues like data silos and limited interoperability that blockchains have struggled with for years—giving users and businesses a practical reason to adopt it. What’s the risk-reward potential of joining the Qubetics presale? With $TICS priced at $0.1573 and ROI projections as high as 9,434.71%, the upside is strong—especially with the presale ending every Sunday and prices increasing by 10% per stage.

43149249,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148003,1744251621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Optimistic Shift: Goldman Sachs Abandons Recession Prediction After Tariff Relief,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/goldman-sachs-recession-tariff-pause/,"In a surprising turn of events, leading investment bank Goldman Sachs has recalibrated its economic outlook, offering a sigh of relief to markets worldwide. Just days after sounding alarms about a potential U.S. recession, the financial giant has withdrawn its forecast. What sparked this dramatic change of heart? It all boils down to a significant pause in tariff implementations by the Trump administration, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X. Let’s dive into the details of this economic U-turn and explore what it means for the US economy and beyond. Why Did Goldman Sachs Initially Predict a Recession? On April 7th, Goldman Sachs raised eyebrows across the financial landscape by increasing its 12-month recession probability for the U.S. economy from 35% to a concerning 45%. This revision reflected growing anxieties about various economic headwinds, including potential impacts from ongoing trade disputes and anticipated tightening of monetary policy. Investors and market analysts closely monitor such forecasts from institutions like Goldman Sachs, as they often influence market sentiment and investment strategies. The initial prediction underscored the fragility of the economic recovery and the potential for unforeseen shocks to derail growth. Here’s a quick look at the timeline: April 7th: Goldman Sachs increases 12-month recession probability to 45%. {{Date of Bloomberg X post}} (Approximate): Trump administration pauses tariff implementation. {{Date of Goldman Sachs withdrawal}} (Approximate): Goldman Sachs withdraws recession forecast. The Game Changer: Tariff Pause and its Economic Implications The central catalyst for Goldman Sachs’ revised outlook is the pause in tariff implementation. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can have a ripple effect across the economy. They can increase costs for businesses, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and reduced corporate profits. In an environment already grappling with inflation concerns, the prospect of new tariffs added another layer of uncertainty and downside risk. By pausing these tariff implementations, the Trump administration has seemingly eased some of the immediate pressures on the US economy, providing a more stable foundation for growth. Consider these potential benefits of a tariff pause: Reduced Inflationary Pressure: Paused tariffs can help prevent further price increases on imported goods, easing inflationary pressures. Business Stability: Companies can operate with more predictability, knowing that input costs are less likely to spike due to new tariffs. Improved Trade Relations: A pause can signal a willingness to negotiate and potentially de-escalate trade tensions, fostering better international economic relationships. What Does This Mean for the US Economy? Goldman Sachs’ withdrawal of its recession call is a significant vote of confidence in the resilience of the US economy . It suggests that while challenges remain, the immediate threat of a sharp economic downturn has diminished. This doesn’t mean the economy is out of the woods entirely, but it does signal a potentially more optimistic trajectory. The pause in tariffs is seen as a crucial factor in mitigating downside risks and supporting continued economic expansion. However, it’s important to remember that economic forecasts are not guarantees, and various factors can still influence the future economic landscape. Key factors influencing the US economy: Factor Potential Impact Inflation High inflation can erode purchasing power and dampen economic growth. Interest Rates Rising interest rates can cool down economic activity and increase borrowing costs. Global Events Geopolitical instability and global economic slowdowns can impact the US economy. Consumer Spending Consumer spending is a major driver of the US economy; changes in consumer behavior can significantly impact growth. Impact on Market Sentiment and Crypto The news from Goldman Sachs is likely to have a positive impact on market sentiment . The removal of a prominent recession forecast can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased investment in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. In the volatile world of crypto, market sentiment plays a crucial role in price movements. Positive news can trigger rallies, while negative news can lead to sell-offs. A more optimistic outlook on the broader economy can create a more favorable environment for crypto adoption and investment. Potential impacts on crypto market sentiment: Increased Investor Confidence: Reduced recession fears can encourage investors to take on more risk, potentially including crypto assets. Positive Price Action: Improved sentiment can lead to increased buying pressure and positive price movements in the crypto market. Broader Market Rally: A general market rally, driven by positive economic news, can often lift the crypto market as well. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do? While Goldman Sachs’ revised forecast is encouraging, it’s crucial for investors to maintain a balanced and informed approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic developments and market analysis from reputable sources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risk, especially in volatile markets. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to short-term market fluctuations. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand your own risk tolerance and invest accordingly. The withdrawal of the recession forecast by Goldman Sachs is a noteworthy development, offering a glimmer of optimism in uncertain times. While economic challenges persist, the pause in tariffs appears to have provided a crucial buffer, altering the near-term outlook. This shift underscores the interconnectedness of global economics and the significant impact of policy decisions on market sentiment. As always, staying informed and maintaining a strategic approach is paramount for navigating the ever-evolving financial landscape.

Crypto transactions would be taxed at 18% with a 5% military levy on top as part of the proposed framework, released on April 8 by Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission. NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Magomedov said in an April 8 statement that “the issue of crypto taxes is not a hypothesis, but a reality that is fast approaching.” He added that the agency created the framework to help lawmakers make an “informed resolution” by considering each suggestion’s advantages and disadvantages because “these aspects can have a critical impact on the market and tax liability.” Under the NSSMC’s proposed crypto framework, a tax will be applied when crypto is cashed out for fiat currency or exchanged for goods or services. Crypto-to-crypto transactions wouldn’t be taxed, bringing Ukraine in line with other European countries, including Austria and France, as well as crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore, the NSSMC said. The regulator says it “makes sense” to exclude stablecoins backed by foreign currencies or only apply a 5% or 9% tax because Ukraine’s tax code already excludes income from transactions in “foreign exchange values.” A translated excerpt of the NSSMC’s report said stablecoins backed by foreign currencies could be exempt from taxation. Source: NSSMC Mining, staking, hard forks and airdrops Other crypto-related activities, such as mining, staking and airdrops, are also addressed in the framework which floated a few options for taxation. The NSSMC said crypto mining is generally considered a business activity, but there might be a general tax-free limit for certain crypto transactions, including mining. Under the framework, staking could be considered as “business captive income” or only taxed if the crypto is cashed out for fiat currencies. While hard forks and airdrops could be taxed either as ordinary income or when the tokens are cashed. Related: Ukraine officials get training on crypto and virtual assets investigation The regulator suggests a tax-free threshold could help “relieve the burden on small investors” and is common in other jurisdictions. Exemptions for donations, transfers between family members, and holders who keep their crypto for a set amount of time are also flagged as possibilities. However, the NSSMC says the exemption might not apply to non-custodial crypto wallets . Last December, Daniil Getmantsev, head of the tax committee of Ukraine’s parliament, said a draft bill to legalize cryptocurrencies was under review and expected to be finalized early this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy first signed a law establishing a legal framework for the country to operate a regulated crypto market in March 2022.

As confirmed by Ripple executives, the SEC has agreed to return $75 million of the $125 million fine Ripple was ordered to pay last year. That would leave Ripple with just a $50 million payment to settle the case. But here’s the catch: the SEC hasn’t officially confirmed anything yet. Big SEC Meeting Set for April 10 The SEC has a closed-door meeting scheduled for Thursday, April 10. This is expected to be very important because Ripple’s deadline to file its response in the appeal process is just days later — on Wednesday, April 16. If the SEC wants to withdraw its appeal about Ripple’s XRP sales, it will likely need to make that decision during this week’s meeting. Otherwise, the case could continue in court. Legal Expert Says Something Is Coming Soon Attorney Fred Rispoli, who has been following the case closely, said that something will happen before or on April 16. He said there’s a 90% chance the case will settle or the appeal will be withdrawn — and only a 10% chance Ripple will actually have to file its legal brief. On SEC v. Ripple, expect to see something happen on or before next Wednesday, 4/16, the due date for @ripple 's appellate brief. Ripple cannot get an extension and either has to file it (10%) or there will be a notice of settlement/withdrawal (90%). https://t.co/j9z0CpTBQo — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) April 9, 2025 When asked if the SEC had already agreed to end the case, Rispoli said the two sides had likely reached an agreement behind the scenes — but the SEC hasn’t made anything public yet, which is standard for them. Why This Matters The appeal is about whether Ripple’s XRP sales on exchanges were illegal. A judge had ruled they were not securities — a major win for Ripple and the crypto industry. If the SEC officially drops its appeal, it would be a big step toward ending the case for good. What’s Next? All eyes are now on the SEC’s April 10 meeting. If the SEC acts, we could see the legal battle finally come to a close by April 16. Until then, Ripple’s fate — and a key moment for crypto regulation — is still in waiting.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-10 02:26:49

The world of trade just took an unexpected turn, and it could ripple through the cryptocurrency landscape. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, known for his assertive trade policies, has announced a temporary tariff freeze . But what’s behind this surprising move, and how might it impact the volatile world of digital assets? Decoding Trump’s Tariff Freeze: A Shock to the System? According to a recent update from Walter Bloomberg, a respected economic news source on X (formerly Twitter), Donald Trump cited ‘fear’ as the primary driver behind this decision. Yes, you read that right – fear. This is quite a shift from his previously stated stance. Let’s break down what we know: The Fear Factor: Trump reportedly stated that ‘people are afraid,’ leading to his approval of a temporary halt on tariff hikes. While the specifics of this fear remain somewhat vague in the initial reports, it suggests concerns about broader economic instability or market jitters. Temporary Relief: This tariff freeze is described as temporary, implying it’s not a permanent policy shift. The duration and exact conditions are still unfolding, leaving room for speculation and market adjustments. Reciprocal Tariffs (Previously): Trump had earlier proposed a 90-day tariff freeze for countries that refrained from retaliating against U.S. tariffs. The condition included a reciprocal tariff rate of 10%. However, China was explicitly excluded from this concession. It’s unclear if the current ‘fear-driven’ freeze follows the same conditions or represents a modified approach. This announcement injects a dose of uncertainty into the already complex global trade environment. But what does this mean for you, the crypto-savvy investor? Market Fear and Crypto: A Tangled Web Market fear is a potent force in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. When fear grips investors, it can trigger sell-offs, volatility spikes, and shifts in investment strategies. Trump’s mention of ‘fear’ as the basis for the tariff freeze is noteworthy. It suggests an acknowledgment of underlying anxieties within the economic system. Here’s how this could connect to the crypto world: Safe Haven Asset? During times of economic uncertainty and market fear , some investors turn to assets perceived as safe havens. Historically, gold has played this role. Increasingly, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being considered as potential digital safe havens, though this narrative is still evolving and debated. Volatility Catalyst: News related to tariffs and trade policies can inject volatility into financial markets. The crypto market, already known for its price swings, could experience amplified volatility in response to these developments. Traders might see opportunities in this increased volatility, while long-term holders may need to brace for potential turbulence. Economic Indicator: Tariff decisions and the underlying ‘fear’ they reflect can be seen as indicators of broader economic health. If market fear is indeed a significant factor influencing policy decisions, it might signal deeper concerns about economic growth, inflation, or geopolitical stability. These macroeconomic factors can indirectly influence investor sentiment towards both traditional and crypto assets. Global Trade Dynamics and Crypto’s Reach Global trade is the lifeblood of the modern economy, and tariffs are a significant tool in shaping trade relationships between nations. Trump’s tariff policies have been a major factor in reshaping global trade flows in recent years. A tariff freeze , even if temporary, can have ripple effects across industries and economies. Here’s the potential link to crypto: Decentralization Appeal: Cryptocurrencies, by their decentralized nature, operate outside the direct control of governments and traditional financial institutions. In a world where global trade is increasingly influenced by geopolitical tensions and policy shifts, the decentralized and borderless nature of crypto could become more appealing to some. Cross-Border Transactions: Cryptocurrencies facilitate cross-border transactions more easily and potentially at lower costs compared to traditional banking systems. In a dynamic global trade environment, this efficiency could be advantageous for businesses engaged in international commerce, especially if traditional trade routes face disruptions. Emerging Markets Focus: Many emerging economies are heavily reliant on global trade . These regions are also witnessing growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. Tariff policies and shifts in global trade dynamics can disproportionately impact emerging markets, potentially influencing the adoption and usage of crypto as alternative financial systems in these areas. Economic Impact : Will the Freeze Thaw Market Concerns? The economic impact of a tariff freeze is multifaceted and depends on various factors, including its duration, scope, and the broader economic context. While a freeze might offer temporary relief, the underlying issues driving market fear may persist. Here’s a look at potential economic impact scenarios and their crypto implications: Scenario Potential Economic Impact Possible Crypto Market Reaction Temporary Relief & Status Quo Short-term market stabilization, reduced immediate trade tensions. Modest positive reaction, potential for sideways trading as markets await further clarity. Sign of Deeper Economic Concerns If the freeze signals broader economic weakness, it could increase investor anxiety. Increased volatility, potential for both upward (safe haven seeking) and downward (risk-off sentiment) pressure on crypto prices. Shift in Trade Policy If the freeze hints at a more lasting change in trade policy, it could reshape global economic relationships. Longer-term implications, potentially influencing capital flows and investor appetite for different asset classes, including crypto. It’s crucial to remember that the economic impact of this tariff freeze is still developing. Market reactions will likely be driven by evolving information, interpretations of Trump’s motives, and broader macroeconomic trends. Navigating the Tariff Terrain: Actionable Insights So, what should crypto investors and enthusiasts make of this tariff freeze ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to trade policy, economic indicators, and market sentiment. Reliable news sources like Walter Bloomberg and reputable financial media outlets are essential. Manage Risk: Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and events like tariff freezes can amplify it. Implement sound risk management strategies, including diversification and position sizing. Consider Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto space. Decentralization, technological innovation, and growing adoption trends remain powerful forces. Analyze Macro Trends: Pay attention to broader macroeconomic trends, including inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth. These factors can indirectly influence crypto market dynamics. Conclusion: A Pause or a Pivot? Trump’s surprising tariff freeze injects a fresh layer of complexity into the global economic narrative. Whether it’s a temporary truce driven by market fear or a sign of a more significant shift in trade policy remains to be seen. For the crypto market, this development underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and the potential for macroeconomic events to create both challenges and opportunities. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and navigate the evolving landscape with a balanced perspective.

43150206,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148023,1744253408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Bitcoin Skeptic Roubini Exposes Fed’s Limits in Trump Trade War,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-intervention-trump-trade-war/,"In a market brimming with anticipation for a Federal Reserve (Fed) bailout at every sign of economic turbulence, a prominent voice of caution has emerged. Nouriel Roubini, the New York University professor and well-known Bitcoin skeptic , has thrown cold water on the widespread expectation that the Fed will swoop in to rescue the markets from the fallout of Trump’s trade war. His recent interview has sent ripples through the financial world, particularly among those invested in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Is the safety net we’ve come to expect truly gone? Let’s dive into Roubini’s stark assessment and what it could mean for your investments. Decoding Roubini’s Warning: Is Fed Intervention Off the Table? Roubini’s core message is blunt: don’t count on the Fed to be your knight in shining armor amidst the escalating trade war impact . He argues that the prevalent belief among traders—that the moment things get shaky, the Fed will step in with monetary easing—might be dangerously misplaced this time. Why this shift in perspective? Several factors are at play: Limited Effectiveness of Rate Cuts: Roubini suggests that the traditional tools of monetary policy, like interest rate cuts, may be less potent in addressing the economic disruptions caused by trade tariffs. Trade wars are supply-side shocks that can lead to stagflation (a combination of inflation and economic stagnation), a scenario where simply lowering interest rates might not be the appropriate or effective solution. Fed’s Hesitation to Intervene Prematurely: He points out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is unlikely to jump into action at the first sign of market jitters. Instead, Powell is expected to adopt a wait-and-see approach, possibly waiting for a clearer signal that Trump is willing to de-escalate his trade actions before considering intervention. This delay could leave markets vulnerable to prolonged periods of uncertainty. Moral Hazard Concerns: Constant Fed intervention to bail out markets can create a ‘moral hazard.’ This means market participants might take on excessive risks, anticipating that the Fed will always be there to cushion any downturn. Roubini’s perspective suggests a potential shift away from this predictable pattern of intervention. In essence, Roubini is challenging the ingrained market reflex of expecting immediate Fed support. He’s urging investors to consider a scenario where the central bank’s response might be delayed or less forceful than in the past, especially when dealing with the complexities of a global trade conflict. The Looming Threat of Trade War Impact on Financial Markets The global trade war impact , primarily initiated by the Trump administration’s tariffs, is not just about import duties and export figures. It’s a multifaceted economic challenge that can trigger a cascade of negative consequences across various sectors and markets. Roubini highlights several key areas of concern: Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, leading to increased costs for businesses. Companies may struggle to find alternative suppliers, leading to production bottlenecks and reduced efficiency. This is particularly relevant in industries with complex international production networks. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, which can translate into higher prices for consumers. While some argue that domestic industries might benefit, the immediate effect can be a rise in inflation, eroding purchasing power and potentially slowing down consumer spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty surrounding trade policies can deter businesses from making long-term investments. Companies may postpone expansion plans, hiring, and capital expenditures until there is more clarity on the trade front. This investment slowdown can dampen economic growth. Global Economic Slowdown: Trade wars can have a contagious effect, impacting not just the countries directly involved but also the global economy as a whole. Reduced trade flows, increased uncertainty, and dampened business sentiment can contribute to a broader economic slowdown, potentially even leading to recessionary pressures. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these broader economic headwinds is crucial. While some view Bitcoin and other digital assets as safe havens during times of economic uncertainty, the reality is far more nuanced. A significant global economic turmoil event can impact all asset classes, including crypto, at least in the short term. Why Bitcoin Skeptic Roubini Doubts Fed Intervention: A Deeper Dive Roubini’s skepticism about the Fed’s willingness or ability to effectively intervene is rooted in his understanding of the current economic and political landscape. Being a known Bitcoin skeptic , his analysis is generally grounded in traditional economic principles, and his views carry weight in mainstream financial circles. Let’s break down his reasoning further: Roubini’s Argument Explanation Trade War is a Supply Shock, Not Just Demand: Traditional monetary policy (rate cuts) is designed to stimulate demand. Trade wars, however, primarily disrupt supply chains and increase costs. Lowering interest rates might not directly address these supply-side issues and could even exacerbate inflationary pressures. Political Constraints on Fed Independence: The Fed is supposed to be politically independent, but in reality, it operates within a political context. Roubini might be suggesting that the Fed could be hesitant to aggressively counter Trump’s trade policies, especially if it’s perceived as directly opposing the administration’s agenda. Limited Policy Space: Interest rates are already relatively low in many developed economies. The Fed has less room to cut rates compared to previous economic downturns. This limited policy space could constrain their ability to effectively respond to a significant economic shock. Risk of Stagflation: As mentioned earlier, trade wars can lead to stagflation. If inflation rises due to tariffs while economic growth slows down, the Fed faces a difficult dilemma. Aggressively easing monetary policy to boost growth could further fuel inflation, while tightening policy to control inflation could worsen the economic slowdown. Roubini’s perspective serves as a stark reminder that the economic challenges posed by trade conflicts are complex and may not be easily resolved by conventional monetary policy tools. His urgent warning encourages a more realistic assessment of the market’s vulnerabilities. Market Instability and the Cryptocurrency Connection The potential for market instability in the wake of trade wars and a potentially less responsive Fed has significant implications for all investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space. While cryptocurrencies are often touted as uncorrelated assets or hedges against traditional market downturns, the reality is more nuanced: Initial Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of heightened market instability , investors tend to move towards cash and perceived safe-haven assets. Initially, this ‘risk-off’ sentiment can negatively impact even cryptocurrencies, as investors reduce exposure to all volatile assets. We witnessed this during the initial market panic of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Longer-Term Inflation Hedge Narrative: If trade wars lead to sustained inflationary pressures, as Roubini suggests is possible, the narrative of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges could gain traction. In this scenario, some investors might turn to crypto as a store of value if they lose confidence in traditional currencies or central bank policies. Correlation with Macroeconomic Events: Cryptocurrency markets, while still relatively nascent, are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic events and global economic sentiment. Significant economic turmoil , such as a global recession triggered or exacerbated by trade wars, could have complex and unpredictable effects on crypto prices. It’s not guaranteed that crypto will act as a safe haven in all scenarios. Regulatory Responses: Economic instability can also prompt regulatory responses from governments and financial authorities. In times of crisis, regulators might become more inclined to tighten control over emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies, which could introduce new challenges and uncertainties for the crypto market. Therefore, while the cryptocurrency market might present unique opportunities, it is not immune to broader economic risks. Understanding the potential for market instability and the complex interplay between macroeconomics and crypto is crucial for informed investment decisions. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights in Times of Economic Turmoil Roubini’s analysis paints a picture of potential economic turmoil and increased market volatility. So, what actionable insights can investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, take away? Diversification is Key: In uncertain times, diversification across asset classes is more important than ever. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto, stocks, bonds, or any other single asset class. A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. Stress-Test Your Portfolio: Consider how your portfolio would perform under different economic scenarios, including a prolonged trade war, market instability , and potential economic turmoil . Understanding your portfolio’s vulnerabilities can help you make informed adjustments. Stay Informed and Agile: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, trade policy announcements, and central bank communications. Be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as the situation evolves. Agility and adaptability are crucial in volatile markets. Manage Risk Prudently: Avoid excessive leverage and risky bets, especially in highly uncertain environments. Focus on risk management and capital preservation. This is particularly relevant in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Consider Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is likely, try to maintain a long-term perspective. Major economic shifts often create opportunities for patient investors who can weather the storm and position themselves for future growth. Roubini’s urgent warning is not necessarily a prediction of doom, but rather a call for realism and preparedness. By acknowledging the potential limitations of Fed intervention and understanding the multifaceted risks of trade wars, investors can navigate the current economic landscape with greater awareness and resilience. In conclusion, Nouriel Roubini’s perspective serves as a crucial counterpoint to the prevailing market optimism regarding Fed intervention. His analysis highlights the potential for prolonged market instability and economic turmoil stemming from trade wars, urging investors to reassess their expectations and strategies. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this means acknowledging that while crypto may offer unique opportunities, it is not immune to broader macroeconomic headwinds. A prudent and diversified approach, coupled with a keen awareness of global economic trends, is paramount in these uncertain times. The era of relying solely on a Fed ‘put’ may be waning, and a new era of market vigilance and strategic adaptation may be upon us.

If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $83,500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $81,400 level. The first major support is near the $80,500 level. The next support is now near the $79,500 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $74,572 swing low to the $83,548 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $78,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $75,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $81,400, followed by $80,500.

43150553,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148024,1744254005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BREAKING: SEC Greenlights Options Trading on Spot Ethereum ETFs – A Game Changer?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-approves-ethereum-etf-options/,"Exciting news for Ethereum enthusiasts and crypto investors! The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just given the green light to options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs . This monumental decision marks a significant expansion in the world of ETH-based financial products, offering investors a wider array of tools to engage with the second-largest cryptocurrency. But what exactly does this mean for you, and how will it reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency options trading? Unlocking New Opportunities with Spot Ethereum ETFs Options For quite some time, the crypto community has eagerly awaited the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs . With the SEC’s prior approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the expectation for Ethereum followed suit, and now it’s a reality! This latest development, as reported by Unfolded on X, takes things a step further by enabling options trading on these newly approved ETFs. But why is this such a big deal? Enhanced Investment Strategies: Options provide sophisticated investors with tools beyond simply buying and holding. With cryptocurrency options on spot Ethereum ETFs , investors can now implement strategies like covered calls, protective puts, straddles, and strangles to manage risk, generate income, or speculate on ETH’s price movements with greater precision. Increased Market Liquidity: The introduction of options typically brings more liquidity to the underlying asset. As market makers and traders engage in options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs , it can lead to tighter bid-ask spreads and more efficient price discovery for ETH itself. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: Options are a staple in traditional finance. The availability of cryptocurrency options on regulated spot Ethereum ETFs may further encourage institutional investors who are familiar with options strategies to enter the Ethereum market. This could lead to a significant influx of capital. Accessibility for Retail Investors: While options trading can be complex, the approval of options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs eventually makes these strategies more accessible to retail investors through brokerage platforms that offer ETF trading. Decoding SEC Approval for Ethereum ETF Options The SEC’s approval process for crypto-related financial products has been closely watched and often scrutinized. The fact that they have now approved options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs signals a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto within the traditional financial framework. Let’s break down what this SEC approval really entails: Aspect Details Regulatory Oversight SEC approval means that the exchanges listing these options trading contracts will be subject to regulatory oversight, providing a degree of investor protection and market integrity. Listing Exchanges While the SEC has approved the *concept* of options on spot Ethereum ETFs , individual exchanges still need to file and receive approval to list specific options trading products. Expect announcements from exchanges in the coming weeks and months. Product Complexity Options trading involves derivatives, which are inherently more complex than simply buying and selling the underlying asset (ETH or spot Ethereum ETFs ). Investors need to understand the risks involved, including time decay, volatility, and leverage. Market Maturity This SEC approval is a sign of increasing maturity in the cryptocurrency market. It demonstrates a move towards more sophisticated financial products and a deeper integration with traditional finance. Navigating the Landscape of Cryptocurrency Options Trading on ETH ETFs With the doors now open for options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs , it’s crucial to understand how to navigate this evolving landscape. Here are some key considerations and actionable insights: Education is Key: Before diving into cryptocurrency options , especially on spot Ethereum ETFs , ensure you have a solid understanding of options terminology, strategies, and risk management. Numerous online resources and educational platforms can help. Start Small: If you’re new to options, begin with small positions and gradually increase your trading size as you gain experience and confidence. Choose Reputable Platforms: Select regulated and reputable exchanges or brokerage platforms that will offer options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs once they become available. Look for platforms with robust security measures and clear fee structures. Risk Management is Paramount: Always employ sound risk management techniques when trading cryptocurrency options . This includes setting stop-loss orders, understanding position sizing, and never risking more capital than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and exchange announcements related to options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs . The Future is Bright for Ethereum and Options The SEC approval of options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs is a watershed moment for the crypto industry, particularly for Ethereum. It signifies a significant step forward in legitimizing and integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. While challenges and complexities remain, the availability of cryptocurrency options on spot Ethereum ETFs promises to unlock new opportunities for investors, enhance market efficiency, and potentially drive further institutional adoption of Ethereum. This development is poised to inject a new wave of excitement and sophistication into the world of crypto investing.

43151647,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63537,1744254027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Beyond BTC & BNB: Is FloppyPepe Presale the Next Big Crypto Wave?,https://timestabloid.com/beyond-btc-bnb-is-floppypepe-presale-the-next-big-crypto-wave/,"If you are on the lookout for upcoming cryptos in 2025, the market has its contradictions. It includes presales like ‘FloppyPepe,’ which have generated a lot of interest and are projected to rise meteorically. Meanwhile, the industry stalwarts, Bitcoin (BTC, 80,114.36) and Binance Coin (BNB, $560.86), exhibit stability and robust ecosystem dynamics. One must comprehend these options within the context of the evolving paradigm in order to navigate the futuristic digital landscape. FloppyPepe ($FPPE): AI Ecosystem Explosive Presale Opportunities The use of AI to facilitate engagement within a community digital ecosystem fully empowers users and allows for value creation beyond speculation, which is what sets FloppyPepe ($FPPE) apart. It intends to incorporate AI tools (FloppyAI chatbot, FloppyX video framework), community aspects (a content creation tool, Meme DAO governance), and purposeful tokenomics through a 3% transaction fee structure (charity funding, holder rewards, and token burns). This extensive framework targeting the 120 trillion token supply seeks to cultivate active users and long-term relevance. Primary interest stems from the presale stage at this point. Offering 60% of tokens for early participation and setting ambitious funding targets of $20M and $45M caps, the returns are expected to be mind-blowing. Seeing as the current price is extraordinarily low at $0.0000002, a speculative target of $0.01 would suggest a staggering 4,999,900% ROI. In other words, a $100 investment would theoretically turn into $5 million dollars, a sharp example of the high-risk, high-reward scenario that the FloppyPepe presale focuses on for those wanting exponential returns. Binance Coin (BNB): Ecosystem Dominance BNB’s value, which anchors the Binance ecosystem and trades strongly at the price of $560.86, receives constant development and further utility through fee payment mechanisms. The launchpad has been a major fee-generation utility. Both developments are supportive of HODLer Airdrops (recently featuring Particle Network); rewards demonstrate commitment that strengthens user esteem and shifts BNB into the category of blue-chip crypto assets. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Benchmark Bitcoin , the first ever introduced cryptocurrency, remains a market leader and benchmark, stabilizing around $80,114.36. Arguably, the Turkish tariff announcement was the most recent shock placed on the market, but in the middle of all this turbulence, BTC remained remarkably stable, supporting the narrative for some investors of it functioning as a digital gold store of value. Bitcoin keeps being relevant in any crypto discussion. Weighing Trending Crypto Opportunities Looking at 2025, the heavily marketed cryptos are always compared to leading ones in terms of value against untapped possibilities. For mainstream trusted options like Bitcoin, there are services like FloppyPepe ($FPPE) taking creative approaches to the presale, pricing out the market in hopes of life-changing ROI figures. The risk the FloppyPepes presale offers for higher demand in exponential growth makes for a compelling story, as opposed to the reasons for BTC and BNB’s predictability.

China announced an increase in tariffs on US goods to 84%, which is to take effect on April 10. This represents a direct response to President Donald Trump’s earlier imposition of a 104% tariff on Chinese imports. These tit-for-tat measures have intensified the ongoing trade war between the two largest global economies. How Did Markets React to Conflicting News? Interestingly, while specific US-China tensions worsened, broader financial markets, including crypto, showed slight recovery in the last 24 hours. The rally was in response to news reports from the White House announcing a 90-day pause on other planned US tariff hikes (not related to the active China tariffs). Prior to this pause, Bitcoin briefly fell below $75,000 and Ethereum was testing levels near $1,400.

Several Wednesday filings show investors can now trade options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Mini Trust. Options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, ETH in this case, at a predetermined price within a set date. James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that the approval was “100% expected,” and the Commission had until April 9 to decide on the approval. Good news.

Covered call strategy eth ETFs, buffer eth ETFs, etc. https://t.co/Ndqz4cEBQ2 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 9, 2025 SEC’s Delayed Decision Over Ether ETF Options The US financial watchdog’s approval of ETHA options on Wednesday, comes after the agency initially postponed its decision on allowing options. Nasdaq ISE filed for the options on July 22, 2024. Following Nasdaq’s filing on BlackRock’s behalf, a letter from Better Markets, warned the SEC to be careful before allowing options trading for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, citing their high volatility. Last October, the SEC approved options trading on 11 Bitcoin ETFs for NYSE American, Nasdaq, and Cboe Exchange. The recent approvals offer a hedging vehicle for investors to meet their needs in connection with Ether-related products and positions, the Commission’s approval note read. “The Exchange believes that offering options on Ether Funds will benefit investors by providing them with an additional, relatively lower-cost investing tool to gain exposure to the price of Ether.” ETH Price Soars Over 14% on ETFs and Trump’s Tariff Pause Following the SEC’s options approval on the ETH ETFs and the recent 90-day Trump tariff pause , Ethereum price spiked 14% in the past 24 hours. Coinmarketplace data shows that Ethereum is now trading for $1,641 at press time. Per Farside Investors data , the SEC’s approval comes at a time when ETH ETF holders are seeing increased losses. The funds were down over 50% YTD, and the trend has affected ETH ETF flows, which saw only four days of inflows since February 20. On the other hand, two -2x ETH ETFs are the best-performing ETFs so far in 2025, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted. These products represent a 2x leverage short positioning on ETH ETFs. The best performing ETF this year is the -2x Ether ETF $ETHD , up 247%. #2 is the other -2x Ether ETF. I was sure it would be $UVIX (2x VIX), but that's #3.

The company submitted an S-1 registration form with the SEC and is also awaiting its approval of a 19-b4 filing, both of which are needed before its trading can begin. Notably, the 21 Shares Dogecoin ETF will track the price of DOGE using the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, giving investors a simple and regulated way to gain exposure to the memecoin without directly needing to hold the asset. 21Shares Joins Grayscale and Bitwise This move comes as Dogecoin bounces back from a sharp sell-off which led to a drop in its price to $0.14. 21Shares becomes the third firm to file for the Dogecoin ETF after Grayscale and Bitwise. The next step is to file a 19b-4 for the fund which will formally begin the approval process with the SEC. Notably, this move comes on the same day as 21Shares launched a Dogecoin ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange, in an ‘exclusive partnership’ with the House of Doge. This ETP is notably the first and only one endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. If the SEC approves the ETF, 21Shares and the House of Doge will collaborate again to promote the fund. Coinbase will serve as the custodian for the fund. This development serves as a bullish outlook for the memecoin which could boost its adotion and drive a surge in its price. Crypto Market Rallies After Trump’s Unexpected Pause Crypto analyst Kevin Capital pointed out a bullish pattern on DOGE’s chart that could signal a potential rebound. While the recent rally may be tied to macro news, specifically Trump’s decision to pause tariffs for 90 days, Kevin noted that the charts had already been hinting at this move. The crypto market saw a rebound after Trump’s announcement with Bitcoin juming to as much as 7.7% to $82,967. While Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP all surged by more than 12%, Solana shot up by an impressive 14%. Paul Atkins Now Confirmed Earlier this year, the firm also filed with the SEC to launch spot ETFs for Polkadot (DOT) and XRP. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart notes that the surge in crypto ETF filings is like a “spaghetti cannon” with companies trying all kinds of ideas to see what the new SEC leadership might approve. The Bloomberg analysts believe there’s a 75% chance that a Dogecoin ETF will get approved this year. Last month, the SEC delayed taking actions on Litecoin, Dogecoin, Solana and XRP ETFs since Paul Atkins was not yet confirmed as the SEC Chair. In a 52-44 vote, the Senate has now confirmed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair, with President Trump expected to sign off soon. With Atkins known for his pro-crypto stance, this marks a major shift in crypto and financial regulation under the Trump administration.",News|Crypto news|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,DOGE|DOT|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-10 03:12:51

The surge appears to validate BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s Monday prediction that the looming economic uncertainty could create an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Trump Tariff U-Turn Ignites $84K Bitcoin Price Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) entered a 12% rebound on Thursday, was triggered by Trump’s abrupt reversal on sweeping tariffs initially aimed at all U.S. trading partners. The revised trade policy, which now targets a flat 10% tariff (excluding China), eased investor fears of an escalating global trade war. Bitcoin price action, April 10 2025 The crypto market responded swiftly. BTC price soared from an intraday low of $74,700 to peak near $83,600, its strongest single-day move since March. Top altcoins followed in Bitcoin bullish lockstep, with Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Solana and Dogecoin also pulled double-digit gains. Markets Reaction Aligns with Blackrock CEO’s prediction Bitcoin 10% price rebound on Thursday coincided with remarks made earlier in the week by Larry Fink at the Economic Club of New York. When asked about Trump’s tarrifs, warned that broad tariffs could trigger a 20% correction in global markets, but added that such a move would likely present an “incredible buying opportunity.” “I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity,” Blackrock CEO, Larry Fink said, emphasising a positive near-term outlook. With Trump’s early tariff U-turn appears to affirm the Blackrock CEO’s prediction that the trade war turbulence over the past, provides a opportunity for savvy traders to buy the dip. negate one of the key bearish risks, market participants seemed to interpret the event as a green light for reentry—validating Fink’s foresight. Binance sees $1.3B exchange deposits amid two-week turbulence Bitcoin price has endured intense volatility over the past week, as Trump tariffs sparked bearish pressure. However, on-chain data trends suggests that the intra-day see-saw price movements may not be over yet. Bitcoin Exchange Deposits vs. BTC price | Source: CryptoQuant According to CryptoQuant data, total Bitcoin deposits on Binance increased by over significantly since the market turbulence began. As seen above, between March 28 and April 10, Binance BTC deposits rose from 2,419,603 BTC to 2,435,662 BTC. Valued at the current BTC prices around $83,500, it means that investors have deposited 16,059 BTC worth $1,340,926,500 over the last two weeks, i When exchange deposits surge, flashes bearish signals, inflating short-term supply and amplifying volatility. First it hints a broad market anxiety, as investors shift tokens into exchange to enable rapid trade reactions to volatile news signals or seek short-term opportunities to reduce exposure if market sentiment worsens. Until Binance begins to see rapid exchange withdrawals indicating transfers into long-term savings, the elevated BTC deposits in Binance-hosted trading wallets suggest majority of active investors remain primed to react to short-term triggers. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Faces Key Resistance at $88.8K as Traders Eye $100K Milestone Despite the bullish momentum, Bitcoin faces a formidable technical barrier at $88,800—the high from April 2 when the initial tariff news broke. The Keltner channel upper limit on the BTCUSD 12-hour chart currently hovers around $88,130, reinforcing this as a critical resistance zone. This aligns with the recent local top recorded last Wednesday, just before Trump announced the initial sweeping tariffs. Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSD Given the speed of the rebound, traders who entered at the start of the correction may look to take profits near breakeven levels, creating a sell-wall scenario. Unless BTC breaks through this choke point with strong volume, the path to $100,000 may remain elusive in the near term. Markets are also in a holding pattern as inflation data from both the U.S. and China is set to be released Thursday. A dovish reading could provide the final confirmation for Fink’s thesis and reinvigorate bulls. Bearish Breakdown Could Target $73.5K if Inflation Prints Disappoint While sentiment has turned cautiously optimistic, the risk of retracement looms large if inflation figures exceed expectations. Hawkish surprises could shift monetary policy outlooks, prompting a market-wide pivot toward risk-off assets. The lower Keltner Channel band—currently around $73,500—marks a strong support area and aligns with a liquidity cluster from last week’s consolidation. A breach below $80,000, particularly on heightened selling volume, could accelerate downside momentum. Moreover, the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) remains negative at -1,888, suggesting the rally has yet to establish firm footing in terms of sustainable trend momentum. Conclusion While the short-term outlook has improved, BTC must overcome the $88,800 resistance to turn $100K from hopeful projection into actionable reality. If inflation data cooperates and investor sentiment remains bullish, the breakout could continue. But a failure to hold the $80,000 level might open the door for a retracement to $73,500, especially if macro headwinds return.

Following the confirmation, Atkins has been cleared to lead a regulatory agency currently undergoing major policy changes, according to Reuters . Atkins, a seasoned SEC veteran and outspoken advocate for the crypto industry, was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed Gary Gensler, who resigned in January following years of conflict with digital asset firms. Atkins served as a SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. Since then, he has led a regulatory consulting firm and advised several financial and crypto startups. He has also co-chaired the Token Alliance, a group promoting blockchain innovation, and even testified in court as an expert witness defending firms sued by the Gensler-led SEC. Ethics filings show that Atkins and his wife hold between $327 million and $588.8 million in total assets, with about $6 million tied to digital assets. Until recently, he held equity and options in Anchorage Digital and Securitize, two major crypto firms, and a $5 million limited partner stake in the crypto investment fund Off the Chain Capital. Now that he is confirmed, he has agreed to divest from all crypto holdings. You might also like: Uniswap, Coinbase, and NYSE execs to join SEC roundtable on crypto trading regulations During his Mar. 27 pre-confirmation hearing, Atkins promised to introduce clear rules for digital assets and reduce political interference in regulatory decisions. He criticized past SEC policies under Gensler as vague and overly aggressive, arguing that they slowed innovation and hurt capital formation. “It’s time to return common sense to the SEC,” he told the Senate panel. The appointment was not without controversy. Senator Elizabeth Warren led the Democratic opposition, citing Atkins’ close ties to the financial industry and his role during the 2008 financial crisis. She warned that putting him in charge of the SEC could weaken investor protections and give too much power to crypto lobbyists. Industry insiders expect Atkins to shift the agency’s focus away from enforcement and toward creating a more supportive environment for crypto innovation. His confirmation comes after acting chair Mark Uyeda and commissioner Hester Peirce recently scaled back the number of lawsuits against crypto companies and reviewed the agency’s approach to digital assets. Atkins’ appointment aligns with the Trump administration’s effort to make the U.S. a global hub for digital assets. With Atkins set to take office soon, many in the industry view this as a sign that blockchain-based financial products will be adopted more widely and that exchange-traded funds approvals will proceed more quickly.

According to an Apr. 9 press release statement , the acquisition marks a huge step for Magic Eden into broader on-chain trading, as interest in non-fungible tokens continues to decline. Slingshot’s technology simplifies cross-chain trading in decentralized finance. Today, users often need to bridge assets, manage multiple wallets, and hold different gas tokens to transact across blockchains. Slingshot streamlines this process with a “ chain abstracted ” experience, enabling users to place spot or limit orders for any token using one non-custodial balance, without worrying about gas or bridges. Magic Eden’s chief executive officer Jack Lu called the acquisition a “major step forward,” saying it aligns with the company’s vision to make trading seamless and accessible. “Pairing Slingshot’s team of product visionaries with Magic Eden’s best-in-class marketing and scaling capabilities accelerates our ability to have an impact on the future of crypto.” — Jack Lu, Magic Eden CEO You might also like: Court approves $11m settlement in Shaquille O’Neal’s Astrals NFT lawsuit Slingshot will continue to operate as an independent platform.

The app won’t launch a token for now, though Magic Eden is exploring ways to bring incentives like referrals and possible ME token integration in the future. The acquisition’s timing is notable. According to DappRadar’s Q1 2025 report , NFT trading volume dropped to $1.5 billion, a 24% decrease from Q4 2024. Sales count fell by 10%, reflecting a slowdown in high-value trades. The global NFT market cap now stands at $3.01 billion, with CryptoPunks alone accounting for 23% of that. In the past 24 hours, the total NFT trading volume was just $4.9 million, as per CoinGecko data . Through Slingshot’s acquisition, Magic Eden seems to be adjusting to this shift, betting on token trading to maintain its dominance . By providing improved discovery tools, fiat onramps like Apple Pay and Venmo, and universal trading balances, the two teams hope to compete with centralized exchanges.

After falling below $80,000 on Sunday, the digital asset has struggled to reclaim upward momentum, reflecting persistent selling pressure in the broader crypto market. While price action continues to dominate headlines, on-chain data reveals deeper shifts in market dynamics. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Onchained highlights a notable transition in Bitcoin ownership patterns. Related Reading: Next Bitcoin Peak Delayed To Late 2026, Business Cycle Expert Warns Bitcoin Short-Term Losses and Long-Term Accumulation In the post titled “Short-Term Capitulation Meets Long-Term Conviction: A Structural Shift in Bitcoin Ownership,” the analyst identified structural changes between short-term and long-term holders, providing insights into the asset’s underlying market behavior. According to the insight, Bitcoin has seen a ~15% drawdown from $88,000 to $74,400 over the past week. On April 7, Short-Term Holders (STH) realized a significant $10 billion drop in their realized cap—a metric reflecting the price at which coins were last moved—marking their largest single-day loss of the cycle. This decline was met with an almost equivalent $9.7 billion increase in Long-Term Holders’ (LTH) realized cap, suggesting a substantial transfer of coins from recent buyers to more experienced holders. By April 8, realized losses from STHs declined to $693 million, indicating a possible exhaustion of panic selling. In contrast, LTHs continued increasing their cost basis by an additional $1.13 billion, reflecting ongoing accumulation despite minimal price recovery. Onchained interprets this as a typical sign of supply transitioning from weaker hands to those with higher conviction, which has historically occurred near market bottoms or early recovery stages. The analyst noted: “This is not merely a coincidence: this is the market transferring coins from weak to strong hands.” Adding: Long-term investors are stepping in with conviction: buying weakness and absorbing supply. – This behavior has historically marked the late stages of corrections or the early phase of recovery. Potential Impact on Market Structure This divergence between STH and LTH behavior may hold broader implications for Bitcoin’s market structure. As STHs reduce their holdings, potential short-term sell pressure and overhead resistance may decline. At the same time, rising accumulation by LTHs suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, even amid current volatility. Historically, similar patterns have preceded stabilization or trend reversals. A shrinking supply in the hands of reactive traders coupled with consistent buying by long-term participants can form the foundation for renewed price support. Whether this shift signals the end of the current correction or an early stage of recovery remains to be confirmed, but on-chain trends continue to suggest meaningful repositioning within the Bitcoin market.

However, another analyst argued that while it could signal an impending sell-off, it might also indicate a bullish trend. Investors are “actively moving funds to Binance” CryptoQuant contributor Maarten Regterschot said in an April 9 post that Binance’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve increased by 22,106 BTC, worth $1.82 billion, over the last 12 days to a total of 590,874 BTC. “This shows a strong acceleration in BTC inflows to Binance. It’s likely that investors are actively moving funds to Binance due to the macro uncertainty and before the upcoming CPI announcement,” Regterschot said. CoinMarketCap shows Bitcoin is trading at $82,474 at the time of publication, up 8.8% in the past day after receiving a boost from Trump’s 90-day tariff pause on all countries but China. Binance’s Bitcoin Reserve has 590,874 Bitcoin. Source: CryptoQuant The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to deliver the CPI results for March on April 10. During uncertain times, traders often move their crypto onto exchanges to sell, leading to more volatility as confidence starts to decline. However, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that this isn’t always a bearish signal. “Large inflows could be a sign of selling, but it is a very fluid market. It is plausible that Binance is shifting assets into its hot wallets to meet heavy demand.” “The next few days are critical in understanding the appetite of the market for crypto after Trump’s climbdown on tariffs,” he said. Earlier on April 9, Trump issued a 90-day pause on his administration’s “reciprocal tariffs,” lowering the tariff rate to 10% on all countries besides China, which he ramped up to 125%, citing the country’s counter-tariffs against the US. “Tensions between the US and China remain a structural overhang,” Hundal said. Related: Bitcoin price at risk of new 5-month low near $71K if tariff war and stock market tumult continues Meanwhile, crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said that the March CPI results “will show inflation is crashing down probably close to 2.5%.” “Another interesting day coming,” he added. Crypto analyst Dyme said , “Lower than expected CPI print will send us higher.” However, FactSet’s consensus estimates show economists expect consumer prices to have risen by 0.1% month-over-month in March. On March 12, the CPI came in lower than expected at 3.1% , beating expectations of 3.2%, with a corresponding 0.1% drop in headline inflation figures.

The vote saw 128 in favor, 93 against, and seven abstentions. Libra Meme Coin Scandal According to the report , the committee will have the authority to summon top government officials and demand documentation from public institutions. Key figures expected to testify include Economy Minister Luis Caputo, Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, and Chief of Staff Guillermo Francos. However, there has been criticism regarding the exclusion of President Milei and his sister Karina from the inquiry. Lawmaker Sabrina Selva, in particular, argued that both should be compelled to clarify their involvement in the LIBRA incident. The investigation follows accusations that Milei used his influence to promote the LIBRA meme coin. The token had surged in value to $5 and even briefly reached a market capitalization of $4 billion after President Milei shared details about the token on X. The value, however, collapsed by over 94% once he deleted the post, which sparked suspicions of a pump-and-dump scheme. In response, lawyers Marcos Zelaya and Jonatan Baldiviezo, joined by engineer María Eva Koutsovitis and economist Claudio Lozano, filed a formal criminal complaint on February 17, wherein the individuals accused Milei of fraud for his role in promoting the cryptocurrency. Several critics have also alleged that the project was a “rug-pull” scam, and Milei was accused of misleading investors by using his considerable social media following of 3.8 million. Findings Related to LIBRA On-chain analytics platform Nansen’s report found that 86% of traders who purchased the meme coin lost an estimated $251 million. Only a handful of fortunate investors walked away with profits of more than $180 million. Subsequent investigation by blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps linked LIBRA’s creators to previous pump-and-dump operations and even showed evidence of profits funneled through various wallets, including one connected to MELANIA token creators.

The move comes days after appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as strategic crypto advisor. Bilal Bin Saqib, the Council’s head and advisor to the finance minister said that the country has been in talks with several Bitcoin mining firms. The location of the Bitcoin mining centre will depend on the availability of surplus power in some regions, he added. “Pakistan is in the top 10 global crypto adopters despite it not being regularised,” Saqib told Reuters , adding that the country has 15-20 million crypto users. Saqib noted that the country aims to foster fintech innovation and growth through regulatory sandboxes, and safe environments for testing. Further, he said that crypto, blockchain and AI upskilling among the country’s youths would foster job creation and economy. This would boost “exports through digital services, positioning the country as a hub for emerging tech talent on the global stage,” he added. Pakistan is consulting with global regulators to build a “Pakistan-first” crypto framework, Crypto Council CEO @Bilalbinsaqib told Cryptonews. #Pakistan #CryptoCouncil https://t.co/GZ9vkwUTo5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 1, 2025 Pakistan’s Challenging Energy Sector The South Asian nation has seen structural challenges in its energy sector over the past years, from high electricity tariffs and chronic overcapacity. Per a 2021 report , Pakistan reportedly generated more electrical capacity than needed. “We are producing much more than we need,” Tabish Gauhar, a special assistant to the prime minister on power, told Reuter at the time. The surplus energy came after the construction of new power plants, largely coal-fired ones funded by China. Per estimates from Ember Energy , Pakistan generates 59% share of electricity from fossil fuels and 41% share of electricity from clean sources, which is above the global average of 39%. Further, the country generates 3% electricity from solar and wind. Global Bitcoin Mining Firms Explore Country’s Potential In a March 25 interview with Bloomberg , Saqib noted that Pakistan is eyeing on global Bitcoin mining firms to utilize its electricity potential. “We welcome companies to visit Pakistan to evaluate for Bitcoin mining,” he said, adding that this is the right time to explore mining options. He also praised the US President Trump, calling him the “biggest, bullish catalyst for crypto in history.” “I think the US sets the tone for the world. Trump is making crypto a national priority and every country including Pakistan will have to follow suit or will be at the risk of being left behind.” The post Pakistan Plans to Utilize Part of Surplus Electricity for Bitcoin Mining: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Mining|Pakistan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|BNB,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-10 03:49:13

The move has injected fresh optimism into markets that have been weighed down by ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty. This development could be the market catalyst many investors were waiting for, potentially signaling the start of a bull run across both traditional and digital assets. Relief Rally: Stocks and Crypto Turn Green Immediately following the tariff pause announcement, U.S. stock indexes rallied sharply. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones all posted significant gains, breaking out of oversold territory with strong green candles on the daily charts. Even gold joined the rally, signaling broader investor relief. In the crypto space, Bitcoin (BTC) surged back above $82,000, marking an 8.87% gain in 24 hours. The move triggered a wave of short liquidations—over $75 million worth—fueling a further price jump. The global crypto market cap now stands at $2.59 trillion, up 8.40% on the day. What’s Next? The 90-day tariff pause runs through the end of June, potentially aligning with historical seasonality in crypto where Q2 often delivers strong gains. April, May, and June have traditionally been favorable months for Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin’s recent performance, especially compared to previous market crashes, has impressed even traditional analysts. Bernstein recently described the current 26% dip as “mild,” especially considering past corrections have reached 50-70%. Many believe this showcases BTC’s growing maturity and institutional support.

In an April 9 letter to New York federal court judge Eric Komitee, Karony’s attorney, Nicholas Smith, said the court should consider an April 7 memo from US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that disbanded the DOJ’s crypto unit . “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” Blanche said in the memo, which added the DOJ “will no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that have the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets.” Blanche also directed prosecutors not to charge violations of securities and commodities laws when the case would require the DOJ to determine if a digital asset is a security or commodity when charges such as wire fraud are available. An excerpt of the letter Karony sent to Judge Komitee. Source: PACER In the footnote of the letter, Karony’s counsel wrote an exemption to the DOJ’s new directive would be if the parties have an interest in defending that a crypto asset is a security, but added that “Karony does not have such an interest.” The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed simultaneous charges of securities violations, wire fraud, and money laundering against Karony and other SafeMoon executives in November 2023. The government alleged Karony, SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and chief technology officer Thomas Smith withdrew assets worth $200 million from the project and misappropriated investor funds. Another attempt to nix the case The letter is Karony’s latest attempt to get the case thrown out. In February, he asked that his trial , scheduled to begin on March 31, be delayed as he argued President Donald Trump’s proposed crypto policies could potentially affect the case. Related: OKX pleads guilty, pays $505M to settle DOJ charges Later in February, Smith changed his plea to guilty and said he took part in the alleged $200 million crypto fraud scheme. Nagy is at large and is believed to be in Russia. SafeMoon filed for bankruptcy in December 2023, a month after it was hit with twin cases from the SEC and DOJ. It was also hacked in March 2023, with the hacker agreeing to return 80% of the funds.

The airdrop will benefit holders of $WLFI tokens, as Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) moves ahead in rolling out its stablecoin, USD1, on Binance’s blockchain. This signs a major step for the stablecoin ecosystem and illuminates some of the not-too-distant future of institutional adoption in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. We just posted a new governance proposal: To test our airdrop functionality by distributing USD1 to all $WLFI holders — rewarding our earliest supporters and preparing for future growth. Join the discussion https://t.co/NDg5yMYUrM — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) April 7, 2025 A Key Moment for USD1 and the WLFI Community Trump’s World Liberty Financial has now deployed its stablecoin, USD1, on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), aimed at the niche community of very early adopters that hold $WLFI tokens. As part of this deployment, WLFI has recently conducted a trial airdrop of its token that is designed to reward not just any holder of $WLFI, but especially those that invested in the $WLFI presale, while at the same time testing the airdrop mechanism ahead of a much more scaled operation in the future. The intent here is very much not to just get some tokens into some hands, but to get some USD1 into the hands of real users, who can effect the sort of real market demand that will give this thing the kind of future it needs to be effective. BREAKING: @cz_binance just reposted the announcement about the $USD1 airdrop on BNB Chain for all $WLFI holders. Trump’s World Liberty Financial has deployed its stablecoin #USD1 on Binance’s blockchain — and now they’re proposing an airdrop to reward the WLFI community. #BSC … https://t.co/1EWmXUuBKI pic.twitter.com/OYAabyENBG — Notaz.Sol (@CryptoNotaz) April 8, 2025 The airdrop’s goal is to give first users a chance to get the USD1 stablecoin, which is intended for mainly institutional and sovereign users, and which is aimed at an even more secure and stable version of the already ultra-secure and stable stablecoin family. For the record, as I understand it, the way stablecoins work is that for every stablecoin that exists, there’s an equivalent amount of currency held either in a bank or something equally safe, and that currency is marked such that it can’t be spent. This is to ensure that stablecoin holders can use them safe in the knowledge that, for instance, when they use a USD1 to pay for something that isn’t a stablecoin, what they’re using isn’t some fake version of a USD1. It’s the real deal. A main point that has grabbed attention is that this airdrop will occur on the Ethereum blockchain to start, with subsequent distributions and cross-chain transfers planned. The stablecoin, USD1, is already compatible with both the Ethereum and BNB Chain ecosystems, and successful testing of token transfers between the two blockchains has been completed, with Wintermute, a key partner in the project, assisting. Key Airdrop Details: What to Expect While the firm has not fully divulged the specific sums involved for the USD1 airdrop, it has suggested that each qualifying wallet will receive a set amount. This is a purposeful move that aims to level up the distribution of funds among holders of $WLFI tokens. The airdrop’s eligibility criteria are tethered tightly to the tokens’ ownership, so the distribution should benefit participants in the presale phase of the token’s launch more than it should benefit the average Joe. While the exact day when the airdrop will happen is still up for debate, WLFI has assured us that this is all part of the live technical test. Moreover, the last details of the airdrop will be determined by community governance. WLFI holders will have a say in the final decision of when and an airdrop will happen and the specifics of how it will be executed. Voting on these decisions is still taking place, but the direction seems clear. With total amount of yes’s getting to an overwhelming amount, even as airdrop hater myself, I can’t help but think that the final destination of this vote is as clear as the number 16. In addition, the process for the final details of the airdrop will be determined through community governance. This governance structure, which is driven by the community, ensures that decisions regarding the project’s evolution are made in a transparent and inclusive manner. It empowers the WLFI community to have a direct say in the future of USD1 and its broader use case. The Bigger Picture: USD1 and Its Future Potential The USD1 stablecoin is a major player in the fast-growing stablecoin market. While most other stablecoins target retail users, USD1 is purpose-built for institutional and sovereign adoption. The backing by U.S. Treasuries and custody of the coin with BitGo offer a degree of trust and stability that is seldom seen in the stablecoin space. Yet those features alone do not secure USD1 a place in the ranks of the largest stablecoins. Deploying USD1 on the Binance Smart Chain is a clear signal that WLFI is positioning itself as a serious contender in the global stablecoin market. By choosing BNB Chain as the platform for its first major deployment, WLFI is leveraging the speed and low transaction costs associated with Binance’s blockchain. This provides a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving DeFi space, where efficiency and scalability are paramount. Successfully testing cross-chain transfers between Ethereum and BNB Chain has allowed the USD1 stablecoin to position itself as a key player in bridging ecosystems. It enables users to move easily and efficiently between disparate blockchain environments. That~s not just a cool party trick; it enhances the immediate liquidity, not to mention the perceived (and actual) accessibility, of the USD1 as a payment medium for institutions that want to integrate stablecoin-based transactions into their business. The next question, of course, is how many other blockchains are likely to interface with the USD1, directly or via smart contracts. Looking Ahead: What This Means for the Future Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial is taking many steps to establish its stablecoin as a key player in the global financial world. A USD1 airdrop is just one of them. The World Liberty USD stablecoin has the potential to become a vital tool for both institutional and retail users—for the former, particularly in a world where regulations are in flux and for the latter, especially in a world where traditional USD-denominated financial products and services are often inaccessible. Trump’s team has promised security, compliance, interoperability among different decentralized finance platforms, and something very much like a ‘normal’ financial ecosystem as part of the deal. This airdrop’s success could indicate a real-world use case shift for stablecoin projects, like the USD1, that seek to find a digital dollar equivalent. As these payment systems gain ground, the airdrop could well mark the first step toward a broader adoption trend for the project—part of a wider shift in the payments space that increasingly looks to next-gen digital assets like stablecoins. The cryptocurrency and blockchain communities will pivot closely to watch as more details unfold with USD1 and the ever-widening WLFI ecosystem. Many will have their eyes trained on the next moves in the stablecoin race. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The confirmation gives Atkins full authority to oversee the agency that regulates America’s capital markets, enforces securities laws and sets the tone for financial supervision under the Trump administration. Senate confirmation is a required step for SEC commissioners and chair appointments, giving lawmakers a chance to scrutinize nominees’ policy views and past records. While presidents nominate SEC leaders, they cannot take office without Senate approval. The process ensures that leadership of a key financial watchdog reflects both executive priorities and legislative oversight.

He is expected to steer the agency in a more market-friendly direction. His nomination was backed by Republicans who view him as a voice for streamlined regulation and crypto innovation. “His tenure will mark a pivotal moment to roll back harmful Biden-era policies, promote capital formation, and enhance opportunities for retail investors,” said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott.

Critics say the SEC had taken a more aggressive approach toward emerging financial technologies. “I have seen how ambiguous and non-existent regulations for digital assets create uncertainty in the market and inhibit innovation,” he wrote in his testimony. The comment hinted at a likely easing of enforcement in the crypto space. SEC’s New Chair Inherits Agency at Crossroads of Market Reform Atkins served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008. He later founded Patomak Global Partners, a Washington-based advisory firm for banks and financial institutions. He also supported crypto industry interests through his work with the Digital Chamber. There, he pushed for regulatory clarity without heavy-handed intervention. Last month, Atkins disclosed up to $6m in crypto-related investments in his ethics filing, including stakes in Anchorage Digital and Securitize. His nomination drew criticism from Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who pointed to his support for deregulation before the 2008 financial crisis. The Senate Banking Committee had advanced his nomination on a narrow 13 to 11 vote. The final vote reflected deep partisan divisions. Still, Atkins’ confirmation was widely expected since Trump had signaled a desire to overhaul financial regulation and replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler. Now confirmed, Atkins will lead the SEC during a pivotal period. The agency is facing market structure reforms and growing pressure around digital asset oversight. It is also confronting broader questions about the future role of federal financial regulators.

On-chain volume for stablecoins hit a never-before-seen $72 billion in a single day, the highest level since February. Moreover, the daily active addresses for stablecoins have crossed 300,000, which is a clear sign of real-world adoption of these digital assets in financial activities. In a way, stablecoins are quietly becoming one of the biggest forces in the financial ecosystem. Stablecoin activity is spiking: daily active addresses just exceeded 300k, while on-chain volume hit $72B yesterday, the highest level since February. pic.twitter.com/DCFIUAXY8e — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 8, 2025 The Rise of Stablecoins: A Shift in Global Finance In recent years, the use of stablecoins—digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar—has very much gained momentum. Among the major players are USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin). They see massive growth, absolutely, and in terms of activity on blockchains, Berachain, Tron, and USDT (Tether) see a lot of it. Those three names there—they see a lot of movement relative to stablecoin activity. Activity that, by and large, sees massive success. Stablecoin activity on these chains just saw a lot of movement. This is very good activity for cross-border payments and DeFi. In the past 7 days, stablecoins(USDT&USDC) on #Tron increased by $396M, and stablecoins(USDT&USDC) on #Berachain decreased by $269.56M. https://t.co/yr8wn96ApU pic.twitter.com/y8UY8piIqJ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 7, 2025 The rapid spread of stablecoins brings many effects. Not only are they gaining traction in the cryptocurrency universe, but they are also starting to gain acceptance in the broad arena of financial systems. What is remarkable about the stablecoin is that it offers the faster transaction times of cryptocurrencies, along with lower fees, compared to traditional financial systems. It is hard to believe that a means of payment not tied to any legal jurisdiction, with no money-back guarantees and no recourse in a court of law, could ever be more stable than the products of our best central banks. Yet that is a claim some stablecoins make. Some use the term “cryptocurrency”; some call them “digital currencies” or “digital assets”. Either way, the stablecoin is a potential game changer. Stablecoins Reach All-Time Highs: A New Digital Economy A recent report by IntoTheBlock stated that stablecoins reached an all-time high (ATH) of $220 billion in circulation during the first quarter of 2025. Not only is this figure a significant milestone for the crypto space, but it also surpasses the GDP of some countries. This underscores the size and influence of this new digital asset. The stablecoin market has now reached such a magnitude in circulation that we can safely say we’re in the early stages of a fundamental shift in the global monetary infrastructure. The trend of digital fiat currencies is accompanied by the growth of stablecoins. The central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that governments and financial institutions are looking into these days are a potential outcome of this exploration. In many respects, stablecoins are already doing the work necessary to prepare the path for the digitalization of traditional fiat currencies. For the most part, they do this through exemplifying what digital currencies tethered to tangible assets can look like. 1/ Stablecoins have quietly become one of the biggest forces in finance. With the right legislation, they can shift entire economies—making payments faster, cheaper, and borderless for everyone. The rails are ready. Regulation is the missing piece https://t.co/W8TSDfvomK pic.twitter.com/M0fu2VN0E4 — Concordium (@ConcordiumNet) April 8, 2025 What’s particularly noteworthy about stablecoins is how they provide an easy bridge between the traditional finance world and the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem. These digital assets offer the kind of stability that fiat currencies provide, yet they’re built on the now-familiar blockchain architecture, which promises (and delivers) a good measure of enhanced transparency, security, and speed in the transactions they make possible. With the right kind of regulatory framework, stablecoins could overtake global finance. The Future of Payments: Borderless and Faster People are not just thinking about cryptocurrencies in new ways because of stablecoins; they are now seeing stablecoins as tools that can be used just about every day, for every sort of transaction imaginable. Cryptocurrencies associated with stablecoins—USD Coin, for example—can be deposited and also withdrawn. When you deposit USD Coin, it goes into an account held by a company that mints the coin. When you withdraw, your funds come back to you in the form of the coin. For example, in nations experiencing elevated inflation or have unstable monetary systems, stablecoins provide an assured and secure avenue for individuals to keep their assets intact and engage in day-to-day economic interactions. But the advantages of stablecoins extend beyond private individuals. Businesses and financial intermediaries are likely to find the growing use of stablecoins associated with two important features of these digital currencies: efficiency and lower costs. As stablecoins are adopted more widely, these two features will become much clearer. Legislation and the Path Forward Stablecoin’s future is closely linked to the legislation and regulation appropriate to them. In many countries, the regulatory frameworks are still under development, and the legal status of stablecoins is a gray area. Yet, with stablecoins prompting ever-greater attention from regulators and central bankers, we can expect that clear and comprehensive guidelines will soon emerge. A clearly articulated regulatory environment can provide the essential underpinning for stablecoins to thrive, giving businesses and consumers the confidence to embrace these digital assets in a significantly more mainstream manner. The prospects of stablecoins effecting payment and transforming the world of cross-border finance are huge, and with the appropriate legislative cover, they could play a key role in the emergence of a genuinely global digital economy. Conclusion: A New Global Payment System Stablecoins are increasing in adoption, volume, and influence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They are becoming a central part of not just a new digital financial world, but of the actual global economy, too. And this is happening in relative silence, without the high drama of a public reckoning with regulators. If you think of DeFi as a new technology stack that has the potential to enable a much more performant global financial system, then stablecoins are key to the stack. The infrastructure of the financial world is growing and evolving. Its new payment system—enabled mainly by stablecoins—is replacing the old one. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The tokens that have been targeted by this decision span a range from the quite familiar to the less popular in the crypto space, and many of them seem to be experiencing sharp price drops in the aftermath of the announcement. The decision by Binance underscores the exchange’s ongoing efforts to curtail the number of questionable listings it has on its platform and to improve the overall trading experience of users. Affected Tokens and Market Reaction Those tokens that have been marked for deletion include: $BADGER, $BAL, $BETA, $CREAM, $CTXC, $ELF, $FIRO, $HARD, $NULS, $PROS, $SNT, $TROY, $UFT, and $VIDT. Following the announcement, the value of these tokens has taken a nosedive, and market sentiment indicates to us that the fear of having such a liquidity issue in a down market is the real reason for this event. The most remarkable declines have been observed in the price of $BAL (Balancer), which fell by 10% and is now at $0.99. Likewise, $BADGER, the native token of the Badger DAO ecosystem, also saw a decrease of 9% over this same timeframe and now is at $1.011. The largest decline, however, was in the price of $CREAM (Cream Finance), which saw a dramatic 20% drop and now is at $3.07. JUST IN: Binance reveals results of first delisting vote — 14 tokens to be removed on April 16. Affected tokens include: $BADGER , $BAL , $BETA , $CREAM , $CTXC , $ELF , $FIRO , $HARD , $NULS , $PROS , $SNT , $TROY , $UFT , and $VIDT . Prices dropped sharply after the announcement: $BAL … pic.twitter.com/mOhrRG4Cmf — Followin (@followin_io) April 8, 2025 The steep price drops are no shock, as people working in the markets tend to move quickly when they hear news of a token being delisted and sell off to avoid holding an asset that could become illiquid if it doesn’t have an exchange to trade on. And when one of the top exchanges bites the bullet and decides to delist a token, as Binance has with a number of tokens recently, the market reacts aggressively—not just because of the immediate potential loss of trading volume, but also due to fears that the asset might be heading down an illiquid path. Why Are Tokens Being Delisted? The delisting process at Binance aims to ensure that the tokens listed on its platform maintain a standard of quality. The exchange has levels of preemptive warnings for tokens that are on the verge of being delisted. Then it’s not just Binance doing the delisting. There’s a fair number of exchanges working in parallel here as far as I can tell. Pushing these tokens off their platforms is generally good for the health of the crypto ecosystem. Binance’s announcement didn’t provide any immediate specifics about why the 14 tokens were being delisted. But this kind of announcement is usually made for a variety of reasons, like very low trading volume, a project that lacks a community or any development going on, or potential legal issues (which many projects are now facing). In the case of the tokens being delisted today, I can’t find any potential legal problem with them, and they clearly have very low trading volume. They may have also been well-known in the DeFi space at one time, but market interest in them is way down. The DeFi project behind the token probably has little relevance these days in terms of development or use case. Although being removed from a listing can negatively affect a project and its community, it does not have to be the terminal event for the token. Some projects may opt to place more focus on obtaining listings on other exchanges. Others may concentrate on trying to fix the problems that caused the delisting in the first place so that they can achieve a better market standing. However, in the immediate aftermath of a Bitcoin exchange declaring a token ineligible for trading, the impact is felt more acutely by the users and traders of that token. The Broader Implications of Delisting on Binance When Binance decided to drop these tokens, it was a clear statement about their competitive nature. Tokens that an exchange can even almost provide visibility for, can also obviously be almost provided liquidity, uh, for. And a token—its access just to a global user base—first of all, and then second, to being perceived as not just some token that some people have heard of but as one that’s, you know, potentially driving innovation or whatever, is just completely critical. And so I think Binance delisting these tokens is just saying as much about those tokens as it is about any platform that can drop a token! And by the way, Binance can drop a token. The news serves as a cautionary tale for traders regarding the risks of trading in underdeveloped or illiquid cryptocurrencies. It brings home the necessity of grasping the probable dangers of holding assets that could be delisted at any moment, and it makes crystal clear the need for everyone to keep a close eye on all cryptocurrency exchange-related news. The projects issuing the affected tokens might view their recent delistings as a chance to revisit their game plans. If you get delisted from a major exchange, it is a setback, but it could also be an opportunity to flag your project for potential investors, have an internal chat about its direction with the core team, and maybe think about pivoting. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Affected Tokens The first-ever delisting vote held by Binance has created quite a buzz in the crypto space. The tokens that were voted on and subsequently affected experienced some nasty price drops, and those drops serve to remind everyone just how important exchange listings are to digital assets. The immediate aftermath of the vote has seen the affected tokens and their communities under quite a bit of selling pressure and with some pretty declining prices. With that said, though, this moment could serve as a crucial turning point for the delisted tokens and their communities. Because if they aren’t going to be listed on Binance anymore, then it really has to be a moment of regrouping and adaptation. In terms of Binance, its resolution underscores a sturdy dedication to keeping the bar high for the assets it lists. The crypto industry is full of companies that pay lip service to “compliance” and “regulatory engagement,” but Binance is taking a different approach: it is now proactive in ensuring that only what it sees as the most viable projects are listed on its platform. Traders can take from this announcement a couple of reminders about the asset class they work in. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Large deposits and sales of the cryptocurrency have been reported by various trading platforms. One of the most notable events concerned a mysterious trader who goes by the handle @pumpdotfun (or Pumpfun) and seems to be in the business of large-scale depositing. After a brief hiatus, this trader has returned to Kraken with another hefty deposit of $SOL. Pumpfun is not the only whale on the move, however. A Closer Look at Pumpfun’s Moves Only 20 minutes have passed since Pumpfun put another 84,358 $SOL—worth a stunning $9.32 million—into the Kraken exchange. This latest move from this private whale, who has yet to reveal his identity, is just the tip of the iceberg. Pumpfun has already sloshed over 2,883,418 $SOL into Kraken—an unbelievable amount of cash worth around $543 million at an average price of about $189 per token. Pumpfun( @pumpdotfun ) deposited 84,358 $SOL ($9.32M) to #Kraken again 20 mins ago. So far, #Pumpfun has deposited 2,883,418 $SOL ($543.5M) to #Kraken at $189 and sold 264,373 $SOL for 41.64M $USDC at $158. https://t.co/qUlZ3FNshD pic.twitter.com/YD52rtrbOp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 8, 2025 Pumpfun has been nothing short of strategic in its trading activity. In conjunction with the hefty deposits, the whale has partaken in offloading portions of its holdings. By far, the most notable of these has been a sale of 264,373 $SOL for 41.64 million USDC, which was executed at an average price of 158 $SOL. This combo of deposits and sales suggests that Pumpfun is engaged in some not-so-obvious market-making. Market observers are closely watching Pumpfun’s next move. The scale of the transactions is huge. The deposits into Kraken signal that Pumpfun may be getting ready for another big sale, or possibly several big sales, or even a take-profit moment, depending on what appears to be a rather murky broader strategy. Notably, the deposits signal a progressively larger sales moment of what was once a ‘buy the dip’ strategy. Another Whale Sells $10.7M in $SOL In an increasingly dramatic development, another whale, this one holding a staggering 1.32 million $SOL—valued at approximately $192 million at current prices—has also been active recently on the market. This whale has other plans, though. Just 30 minutes ago, it sold off 100,000 $SOL, valued at around $10.7 million. This massive sale has drawn attention not just because of the whale’s size and the scale of its holdings but also for what it might mean for the future price of $SOL. What makes this sale especially noteworthy is the context surrounding the whale’s prior actions. Approximately 15 days ago, the whale unstaked a total of 1.32 million $SOL, a move that raised eyebrows at the time. Following this, the whale deposited 1.2 million $SOL into Kamino, a decentralized liquidity protocol, and borrowed $20 million in the process. This indicates that the whale may have been looking to leverage its $SOL holdings, perhaps for liquidity purposes or to cover other positions. Given the sale’s timing, it’s possible that the whale is now divesting itself of some $SOL to cover the borrowed funds or to manage risk. A whale holding 1.32M $SOL ($192M) just sold 100,000 $SOL ($10.7M) 30 minutes ago. 15 days ago, the whale unstaked 1.32M $SOL , deposited 1.2M $SOL into #Kamino , and borrowed 20M $USDC . He likely sold $SOL to cover the loan. https://t.co/2ucFr3IYiw pic.twitter.com/paOLh9dt4O — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 9, 2025 Although it is hard to pinpoint the exact motivations behind the whale’s big moves, these large trades frequently signal a drive to manage risk or to snag some value at major price points. The whale’s choice to part with 100,000 $SOL after picking up 20 million USDC suggests they are very much in the liquidity management camp and possibly looking to hedge future volatility in the $SOL market. Potential Market Impact The combined actions of Pumpfun and the unnamed whale are making the $SOL market go absolutely berserk. This is obviously a problem because when you shove a ton of assets into an exchange like Kraken, you’re essentially making the price of that asset go up. In this case, both cryptids are clearly making big moves and using that to inflate the price of $SOL—almost like a pump and dump. Kraken has itself seen some serious movements of late, and is currently one of the bigger players in the $SOL space, especially in terms of volatility. Disproportionate affects on the price of a cryptocurrency, like $SOL, can often be traced to whale activity. $SOL has experienced turbulence this summer, but it has a relatively stable price now. Traders must be on high alert for any further actions from the large holders of $SOL, as these may cause big shifts in market sentiment. Simultaneously, the reality that these whales are so energetically interacting with decentralized liquidity protocols like Kamino prompts a re-examination of what might be driving their engagement. With what can only be described as a lot of $SOL, it’s clear that some investors are using very sophisticated strategies to attempt to wring out as much value as possible—beyond the ordinary price speculation in which most crypto investors engage—from their holdings. And those sophisticated strategies seem to mostly involve providing liquidity in decentralized exchanges like Kamino. Conclusion: What’s Next for $SOL? $SOL has been the recent center of attention among crypto projects where not only has it been mentioned here but so too have significant deposits and sales from leading whales. Some are speculating this might be the precursor to the next big thing for the token. Not that anyone could with certainty predict the next big direction for $SOL, but I would suspect that in the raw movement of large $$ amounts of deposits and sales, we’re seeing a potential change in sentiment, something for which the $SOL token could be theoretically user-upgraded. The crypto community is closely observing to see if Pumpfun and the other whale will continue to make moves that could further impact the price of $SOL. Given the size and scale of their holdings, these whales are likely to be influential in the near-term price action of Solana, and their decisions will almost certainly affect the broader market dynamics in the next few days. As always in crypto, the actions of a few powerful players can ripple out to create major shifts in the market, and $SOL may be poised for more surprises ahead.

Options are financial instruments that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, without owning it directly.

43155053,https://nulltx.com/?p=147889,1744262445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Mysterious “7 Siblings” Group Moves $8.3 Million in MKR: What’s Behind the Massive Token Shift?,https://nulltx.com/mysterious-7-siblings-group-moves-8-3-million-in-mkr-whats-behind-the-massive-token-shift/,"In a development that has left the crypto community abuzz, the obscure group known as ‘7 Siblings’ has recently unlocked a large amount of $MKR tokens from MakerDAO; this has left many in the community concerned over possible market implications. The group unlocked a total of 7,000 $MKR, worth about $8.3 million at current prices. Since unlocking the tokens just five hours ago, the group has already sold off a portion of their holdings. This has left many in the community speculating over what exactly is going on. A Strategic Move or a Market Dump? The immediate action taken by the “7 Siblings” was to sell 706.7 $MKR tokens worth about $861,000 for 594.95 $ETH. This trade, which comes to an average of around 1,218 $MKR per token, has raised quite a few eyebrows. While significant, the sale of 706.7 tokens is almost insignificant in the larger scheme of things, since there are so many more tokens yet to be sold. And even with this sale, the group still possesses a staggering amount of $MKR tokens, 6,293 to be exact, which on the open market translates into $7.47 million. Many are now asking: Why would an entity of such size and obscurity make such a big move? The market is no stranger to big token transfers and to significant sell-offs, but what makes the “7 Siblings” really interesting is the group’s anonymity. With no clear ties to MakerDAO or any other major public associations, their actions seem to be extremely well-planned and purposeful—though exactly what they are planning and for what reason remains a total mystery. The Impact on MakerDAO and the Broader Market One must also consider the timing of the sell-off. Although nearly $861,000 worth of $MKR tokens sold off may not have an immediate impact on the MakerDAO ecosystem, the potential subsequent sale of a greater number of $MKR tokens could very well pose a larger risk. Ever since the price of $MKR began not just decreasing but also showing increasing volatility, market participants had started watching for any signs of significant changes in the large holder accounts of $MKR. Given how pivotal the token is to not just the governance, but also the functioning of the entire MakerDAO system and, by extension, the DeFi ecosystem, much larger implications were at play with this sell-off. The mystery group “7 Siblings” may be dumping $8.3M worth of $MKR ! 5 hours ago, this entity unlocked 7,000 $MKR (~$8.3M) from #MakerDAO and has since sold 706.7 $MKR ($861K) for 594.95 $ETH , at an average price of $1,218. Now, 6,293 $MKR (~$7.47M) remains in their holdings,… pic.twitter.com/P0FgCqa2rg — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 9, 2025 If the 7,000 MKR tokens keep getting traded at the current rate, we could see the token’s price pushed down as the market reacts to the news. The price point of $1,218 per token that was observed when the trade happened is notable. It’s a drop, for sure, from previous price points at which MKR was trading. How far and fast MKR liquidates seems in large part to be a function (no pun intended) of how far and fast the group that has amassed a large stash of the tokens wishes to push down their price. For MakerDAO, which is already countering the riddle of DeFi market swings and governance verities, the actions of this secretive group could add another layer of uncertainty. It’s possible, though, that the group is playing a longer game, and the sell-off is part of a larger plan. The whole thing could thus turn into quite the controversy, depending on how the group decides to manage the remaining MKR tokens they hold. By the way, does anyone even know if these guys are good or bad for Maker? What We Know About the “7 Siblings” The “7 Siblings” are still a relatively obscure entity in the world of cryptocurrency. Yet they have recently been the focus of some attention—and even concern—because of their large and apparently coordinated activities within the ecosystem of MakerDAO, one of cryptocurrency’s more important projects. Who the “7 Siblings” are, and what they’re about, remains anyone’s guess. But their name is certainly good for a few raised eyebrows, with speculation about them reaching and surpassing the event horizon of a good ol’ Bay Area mystery. In crypto, large entities or wallets being anonymous is not uncommon, but it does give an air of mystery to their actions. Speculation has run rampant around the decision to unlock and begin selling a large amount of $MKR tokens with no clear reason given behind it. Could they be trying to manipulate the market for short-term gains? Are they trying to pull off the ol’ robotrading market-make trick? Or could they be trying to use the unlocked tokens to gain control over the MakerDAO ecosystem? Or, you know, maybe they’re just selling some of their assets. Conclusion: Is the Market in Danger? The group’s actions have now raised serious questions within the broader crypto community. With the remaining 6,293 $MKR tokens still in the possession of the ‘7 Siblings,’ there is now the potential for up to 6,293 more tokens to be liquidated depending on the group’s token handling decisions. Market volatility is a definite possibility. Though we can presently see the effects of the $861,000 sell-off, it’s the prospect of more moves from this enigmatic entity that has people agitated. Is this a single liquidation event or the first step in a much larger plan? Only time will tell. What remains undebatable is the fact that the “7 Siblings ” are keeping a very close eye on the MKR market and that they may well be the ones shaping its future in the next several days.

43156836,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=120704,1744262463,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here’s Why XRP Could Hit $29 if Bitcoin Claims $170K Following XRP/BTC Bullish MA Cross,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/04/10/heres-why-xrp-could-hit-29-if-bitcoin-claims-170k-following-xrp-btc-bullish-ma-cross/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-why-xrp-could-hit-29-if-bitcoin-claims-170k-following-xrp-btc-bullish-ma-cross,"A market analyst recently suggested that XRP has the potential to reach a new peak on the XRP/BTC pair following a bullish cross against Bitcoin. Notably, XRP is beginning to show signs of renewed momentum after a rough week that has seen the asset dip 2.89% in the last seven days amid widespread market volatility. Despite the bearish cloud, XRP has staged a strong recovery push, recently reclaiming the $2 mark and notching an impressive 12.38% gain in the past 24 hours. This resurgence comes at a critical moment, as a rare bullish crossover has just materialized on the XRP/BTC weekly chart.XRP/BTC Pair Observes Bullish Crossover Technical analyst EGRAG Crypto recently spotlighted this bullish signal, which involves the 55-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossing above the 155-week Simple Moving Average (MA). For context, this crossover occurred on Feb. 17, 2025, two weeks after the ongoing market-wide turbulence ensued. During this period, XRP witnessed consecutive declines against BTC, as the firstborn crypto showed less volatility. Interestingly, the February 2025 crossover marked just the second time in XRP/BTC history that such a pattern has formed. XRPBTC 1W Chart | EGRAG Crypto Notably, the last time it happened was on May 15, 2017. What followed that previous crossover was a staggering 958.97% surge in the XRP/BTC ratio , pushing the pair from deep lows to a peak of 0.00022104 BTC per XRP. This occurred as XRP skyrocketed to the ATH of $3.8 in January 2018.According to EGRAG, the current setup seems to mirror that historic pattern. Citing this historical precedent, the analyst suggests the same explosive run from 2017 could materialize once more. A Massive XRP Uptrend After Downward RetestFollowing the February 2025 crossover, XRP/BTC attempted to retest the 55 EMA but veered off before touching it. If the pair manages a proper retest now, it could crash from the current 0.00002424 level to 0.00001850. With Bitcoin trading around $80,000 in such a scenario, XRP would drop to near the $1.48 price point.Now, after this slump, XRP could finally stage the much-needed rally. Assuming XRP/BTC repeats the previous 958% rally, EGRAG indicates that the ratio would climb to about 0.000171 BTC. However, if Bitcoin trades at the Fibonacci 0.702 level near $97,000 when the pair reaches 0.000171, this will place XRP at roughly $16.5. Nonetheless, if the firstborn crypto resumes its uptrend and breaks into new highs, XRP could achieve even more dramatic prices.For instance, should Bitcoin reach $130,000, XRP would hover around $22 at an XRP/BTC ratio of 0.000171. A $150,000 BTC would push XRP to $25, while a climb to $170,000 could catapult XRP to a formidable $29. These projections focus on the XRP/BTC ratio maintaining momentum from its February bullish crossover and Bitcoin sustaining its macro uptrend.In addition to this, EGRAG's chart reveals four bottoms for XRP/BTC since 2014, with the latest forming in early 2025. Each bottom historically preceded a significant upward move, and the current market situation suggests a similar breakout could be underway.At press time, XRP changes hands at $1.98, having lost the $2 mark again. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades for $81,753, dropping from an earlier intraday peak of $82,743. With these current prices, the XRP/BTC pair stands at 0.000024.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-04-10 05:21:03
43155121,https://coinpaper.com/8449/paul-atkins-officially-confirmed-as-new-sec-chair,1744262548,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Paul Atkins Officially Confirmed as New SEC Chair,https://coinpaper.com/8449/paul-atkins-officially-confirmed-as-new-sec-chair,"Atkins was a former SEC commissioner and co-chair of the Token Alliance, and brings a lot of experience from both traditional finance and the digital asset space. His confirmation coincides with a broader push to modernize outdated US securities laws, which was mentioned during a House Committee hearing that placed a lot of emphasis on the need for clear, crypto-specific regulations. Meanwhile, Thailand is also tightening its oversight of digital assets with stricter anti-crime measures targeting foreign platforms and scam-related activities. Paul Atkins to Lead SEC Paul Atkins has officially been confirmed as the new chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a 52-44 Senate vote that mostly followed party lines. The confirmation on April 9 happened after President Donald Trump nominated the former SEC commissioner and Wall Street consultant late last year. Atkins previously served as a commissioner from 2002 to 2008 during the global financial crisis, and he is expected to usher in a pro-crypto shift at the agency. Senate vote on Paul Atkins (Source: US Senate ) SEC commissioners welcomed Atkins back to the agency in a joint statement , and they are very optimistic about his leadership. With deep ties to both the financial and digital asset sectors, Atkins brings a wealth of experience to the role. He founded Patomak Global Partners in 2009, which is a firm that focuses on regulatory compliance and risk management, and until late 2024, he served as co-chair of the crypto advocacy group Token Alliance. Atkins will replace Mark Uyeda, who served as acting chair since Jan. 20 after the resignation of former chair Gary Gensler. Under Gensler, the SEC pursued many very aggressive enforcement actions against crypto firms. In contrast, the Trump administration has already taken a much friendlier stance on digital assets, and even created a Crypto Task Force and dropped several of the Gensler-era investigations. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott is also confident in Atkins' ability to support innovation while providing regulatory clarity. At a Senate confirmation hearing in March, Atkins said that one of his top priorities will be to establish a coherent and principled regulatory framework for digital assets. However, Atkins’ confirmation was delayed due to the need to file several financial disclosures. These filings were prompted by his marriage into a billionaire family linked to TAMKO Building Products LLC, which is a roofing company that saw over $1.2 billion in revenue in 2023. Paul Atkins According to Fortune, Atkins and his wife, Sarah Humphreys Atkins, have a combined net worth of more than $327 million. His disclosures also revealed personal holdings of up to $6 million in crypto-related investments, including stakes in Anchorage Digital and Securitize, which are both key players in the digital asset ecosystem. Outdated SEC Laws Hold Back Digital Assets At a House Committee hearing on April 9, legal experts and industry leaders pointed out some of the challenges posed by outdated US securities laws in regulating digital assets. Rodrigo Seira, special counsel at Cooley LLP, testified that the existing regulatory framework under the SEC is fundamentally incompatible with the realities of the crypto industry. He argued that despite claims that crypto projects can register with the SEC, the experience of numerous companies suggests otherwise. Seira explained that no crypto project has successfully navigated the SEC’s registration process without falling into prolonged legal uncertainty or collapsing under regulatory burdens. Rodrigo Seira (Source: House Committee on Financial Services ) While acknowledging that crypto promoters who raise funds should be subject to securities laws, Seira criticized the current process, which he said requires projects to operate like traditional public companies. This, he argued, places an unreasonable strain on digital asset ventures that differ quite a bit from traditional securities issuers. The hearing was titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: Aligning the US Securities Laws for the Digital Age,” and also included testimony from WilmerHale partner Tiffany J. Smith, Polygon chief legal officer Jake Werrett, and Alexandra Thorn from the Center for American Progress. The discussion centered on the need to modernize regulations to boost innovation without compromising investor protections. Representative Bryan Steil, chair of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, opened the hearing by acknowledging that many regulatory barriers were established under the previous administration. He stated that the current administration, under President Donald Trump, is working to reform these laws through new legislation. Representative Bryan Steil (Source: House Committee on Financial Services ) One such measure, the STABLE Act , was recently advanced by the House Financial Services Committee and aims to regulate US dollar-pegged stablecoins. In the Senate, the GENIUS Act is also moving forward with its focus on reserve requirements and anti-money laundering compliance for stablecoin issuers. According to Steil, the next major objective is the advancement of comprehensive market structure legislation to clearly define legal categories for digital assets and outline the roles of federal agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Representative Ro Khanna added momentum to the conversation by stating at a recent conference that this long-awaited market structure bill is likely to pass before the end of the year. Thailand Tightens Grip on Crypto Crime Other countries are also changing how they approach digital assets. Thailand is stepping up its efforts to combat online crimes involving digital assets through newly approved legal amendments. On April 8, the country’s cabinet passed a resolution endorsing changes to its emergency decrees on digital asset businesses and cybercrime prevention. These amendments were announced by the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, and they aim to curb the use of digital assets in illicit activities by implementing tighter regulations and penalties. Part of the Thai SEC announcement (Source: SEC ) Under the new measures, crypto asset service providers will be required to monitor and report transactions linked to online scams, and suspend suspicious accounts. A key focus is on cracking down on so-called mule accounts that are used in scams. Violators are facing penalties of up to $8,700 and three years in prison. The amendments also grant authorities the power to block foreign crypto service providers from operating in Thailand, which is intended to mitigate some of the risks tied to money laundering and unregulated platforms. The legal changes are not limited to crypto-focused businesses. Commercial banks, telecom providers, and social media platforms are now also held jointly responsible if they fail to meet standards set by regulatory authorities to prevent cybercrimes. This broadens the scope of accountability and clearly proves that the government is focused on tackling the issue on multiple fronts. One of the more major aspects of the legislation is the explicit restriction of foreign cryptocurrency peer-to-peer service providers. These platforms are now classified as digital asset exchanges under Thai law and are barred from serving local users. The government wants to confine such services to local providers in order to better manage compliance and reduce vulnerabilities. Despite these regulatory crackdown, Thailand continues to show interest in fostering controlled crypto adoption. Trials for crypto payments have been launched in select cities like Phuket, and regulators are exploring the possibility of approving crypto exchange-traded funds.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-10 05:22:28

Known for its strategic and high-profile investments, the firm has subscribed to 250 million WLFI tokens, worth $25 million, at a price of $0.10 per token. This purchase has raised eyebrows across the industry, particularly because of the high premium at which the tokens were acquired. DWF Labs’ Purchase: A Bold Move To put things into perspective, DWF Labs’ acquisition of WLFI comes just days after they made a payment of $25 million to WLFI’s multi-signature wallet in exchange for 250 million tokens. The price of $0.10 per token marks a significant leap from earlier fundraising rounds for WLFI. For comparison, the seed round for WLFI tokens priced each unit at just $0.015, meaning DWF Labs’ acquisition price is more than six times higher than the initial offering. Even in the second round, the price was $0.05 per token, making DWF Labs’ latest investment exactly double the previous rate. DWF Labs Just Subscribed 250M $WLFI at $0.10 — 6.67x the Seed Price! Something huge might be brewing around WLFI… Just four days ago, DWF Labs sent 25M USDC to WLFI's multi-sig wallet and in return, received 250M #WLFI tokens at $0.10 per token — a price that’s: pic.twitter.com/2Fu16AqYKE — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 9, 2025 Although this large-scale investment in WLFI comes as a surprise, particularly given that WLFI has yet to initiate an official public sale at this price point, it has ignited speculation that something of significance may be brewing for the project. After all, it’s not every day you hear about a firm like DWF Labs paying a premium for a token, especially one that’s nominally in a “no-price” market. Why the Premium? This move raises the essential question: Why pay such a premium for WLFI tokens? Given that the public sale for WLFI hasn’t occurred at the $0.10 price, it’s unclear why DWF Labs would opt to pay a price for WLFI tokens that is higher than what might be available to regular investors down the road. This purchase really suggests two things. One: DWF Labs has some special knowledge about the future worth of WLFI. Two: More directly, something big is about to be announced that will raise the token’s value. In the crypto world, timing and access to information are everything. By sinking such high-brow investment into this project, DWF Labs might be positioning itself to gain a first-mover advantage, whether that’s through the launch of a major feature, a partnership announcement, or some groundbreaking development in the WLFI ecosystem. With crypto markets notoriously volatile, such strategic investments often indicate confidence in the future trajectory of a project, which soon may make a big splash. WLFI involving a well-known company raises questions about the project roadmap. Although relatively quiet on the official announcement front, this sudden inflow of funds could signal that WLFI is just about to unveil a major partnership or product. Obviously, investors will now be watching closely to see if any progress on the WLF-I front can explain why DWF Labs was willing to pay such a premium. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for WLFI? This investment could mark a crucial turning point for WLFI. As is the case often in the crypto space, early investors tend to get the best deals, and DWF Labs’ involvement could help provide credibility and visibility for the project. When a firm with the track record of DWF Labs shows interest, it often brings along the promise of more institutional support, partnerships, and perhaps even further investment in the future. Additionally, the reality that WLFI has not yet formally started its public sale at the $0.10 price point could indicate that this is a handsomely engineered event to stir up momentum in front of a more sizable unveiling. DWF Labs’ massive buy at a hefty price suggests quite the opposite of a lack of confidence in WLFI’s future, and this confidence might just be rubbing off on some other institutional or individual investors as they apparently get ready for some big news. The observers from both the community and the industry are soon going to witness some further developments. We do not yet know what WLFI plans to do with the funds: will it launch a new product, sign an exclusive partnership, or make some sort of major announcement that justifies the price it pays for the assets? Time will tell, but this is already clear: DWF Labs isn’t going to stop at just this initial public offering. To conclude, the first sign that something much bigger might be going on behind the scenes at WLFI could be this strategic acquisition by DWF Labs. Speculation is the lifeblood of the crypto market; with DWF Labs involved, it’s only a matter of time before WLFI becomes the subject of some pretty intense speculation.

In a sudden policy flip, Trump paused the global tariff war for 90 days, sending shockwaves through financial markets. Cryptocurrencies responded fast, with major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all soaring. As Trump announced a 90-day suspension of the tariff war with most countries, the cryptocurrency market rose sharply, with ETH rising 15% to over $1,600 and XRP rising 15.3% to over $2. The liquidation amount in 24 hours reached $587 million, and the short position liquidation… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 9, 2025 Crypto Rebounds After Weeks of Bloodbath After weeks of downward pressure from rising tariffs, crypto finally got a breather. Bitcoin jumped from $76K to $82K in just a few hours, reclaiming levels not seen since Sunday. Ethereum surged 15% to over $1,600, while XRP jumped 15.3% to cross $2. The total liquidations in the past 24 hours hit $587 million, with $374 million wiped out from short positions alone, according to Coinglass . Before the announcement, the crypto space was bleeding. Bitcoin had fallen to $74,000—the lowest in five months—after Trump launched a wave of tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. Ethereum and XRP were also down more than 20% each. But once the news of a 90-day pause broke, the tide turned fast. Tariff War Still Playing Hide ‘n’ Seek Interestingly, while Trump paused most tariffs, he also escalated things with China. Tariffs on Chinese goods were bumped up to 125%, following a sharp response from Beijing, which threatened 84% tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump justified the reason behind the move by accusing China of “disrespect” in trade negotiations. Despite the China clash, markets responded positively to the overall pause. The move was seen as a signal that Trump might be open to compromise. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump’s $750B Tariff Plan Is a Massive Wealth Shift, Says Billionaire Investor Chamath , Altcoins and Memecoins Join the Party Altcoins followed the surge.

Other Solana memecoins like BONK and WIF jumped 14%, outpacing even Trump’s own token, TRUMP, which rose 8.1% to $8.25. On Ethereum, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) also soared over 10%, helping push the meme coin market up by 8.5% overall. Not Back to All-Time Highs Yet Despite today’s rally, many top coins are still far from their record highs. DOGE is down 78% from its 2021 peak, XRP is still 40% below its 2018 high, and Solana is nearly 60% off its January top. Still, for a market that was in deep red just days ago, Trump’s pause has sparked real hope and reminded everyone that in crypto, one headline can change everything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SEC Greenlights Options Trading for Spot Ethereum ETFs in Historic Institutional Shift The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved options trading for several spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The ruling , made public on April 9, opens the door for institutional investors to employ sophisticated hedging and speculative strategies tied to Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The SEC's decision follows a proposed rule change originally filed by financial giant BlackRock on July 22, 2024, to allow options trading on its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The approval now extends to multiple Ethereum-based ETFs, including Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH), and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH). In its statement, the SEC explained that the proposed amendment to exchange rules will permit the listing and trading of options on these Ethereum funds, with the agency emphasizing the added utility this provides to market participants. “Options on the Trust will provide investors with an additional, relatively lower cost investing tool to gain exposure to spot Ether, as well as a hedging vehicle to meet their needs in connection with Ether products and positions,” the Commission noted in its communication with Nasdaq. The move is widely seen as a turning point for Ethereum’s legitimacy within traditional finance. Options are considered a vital component in portfolio risk management, offering investors the ability to hedge against downside volatility while enabling more dynamic trading strategies. While Bitcoin has long enjoyed a wider suite of financial instruments, Ether has remained somewhat sidelined—until now. Despite the July 2024 approval of spot Ether ETFs, market reception has been muted compared to the exuberant inflows seen in Bitcoin products. Data from VettaFi shows that BlackRock’s ETHA, one of the largest Ether ETFs, currently holds $1.8 billion in net assets, a staggering 56% drop from its early-year peak. This latest development could reignite interest. Analysts believe that the availability of options will not only enhance Ether’s appeal to risk-managed portfolios but also provide new pathways for market makers to ensure deeper liquidity and tighter spreads across Ether markets. Political Winds Favor Crypto The SEC’s greenlight also reflects a broader regulatory shift in Washington. Since President Donald Trump’s return to office, the agency has noticeably eased its aggressive stance on crypto enforcement. This shift has been surprisingly swift, catching even seasoned legal analysts off guard. Legal scholars from the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance noted that the regulatory softening under the new administration materialized much faster than anticipated, with multiple high-profile investigations into crypto firms being shelved. Among those off the hook are centralized exchange Gemini, public company Coinbase, decentralized protocol developer Uniswap Labs, and NFT marketplace OpenSea. Simultaneously, the US legislative landscape is making parallel progress. Pro-stablecoin bills are advancing through Congress, with the STABLE Act—focused on enshrining the legal use of stablecoins—passing the House Financial Services Committee, while the GENIUS Act, a Senate-led initiative to govern stablecoin issuance, made it through the Senate Banking Committee. These developments are paving the way for a more comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Lawmakers have also hinted that a sweeping crypto market structure bill is on the horizon and could be finalized before the end of 2025. Ethereum’s Next Chapter As Ethereum’s utility and legitimacy continue to expand, market observers are optimistic about the long-term prospects of the asset—even as Ether’s price currently lingers around $1,616, near a two-year low. The availability of options, combined with a more permissive regulatory environment, could catalyze a reversal in institutional sentiment. As investors weigh the impact of these changes, one thing is certain: Ethereum’s institutionalization has just entered a powerful new phase. 21Shares Files for Spot Dogecoin ETF with SEC, Signaling Serious Push for Meme Coin Legitimacy Meanwhile, digital asset manager 21Shares has officially filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Dogecoin ETF. The proposed ETF would mark a new chapter in the meme coin’s mainstream journey, offering traditional investors direct exposure to Dogecoin (DOGE) through a regulated financial product. The filing , submitted on April 9, comes amid a growing wave of applications from rival firms including Grayscale and Bitwise, both of which have also recently filed for spot Dogecoin ETFs. According to 21Shares’ filing, the ETF will be designed to track the real-time market price of Dogecoin. The fund will be supported by Coinbase Custody, which is proposed to act as the official custodian for the underlying assets. However, the application did not specify which US stock exchange would host the ETF, nor did it disclose the management fee or ticker symbol. What makes this filing particularly notable is the firm’s partnership with the Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, which will assist 21Shares in marketing the fund. The collaboration with House of Doge marks a rare formalization of community-led assets into structured, institutionally-accessible investment products. Dogecoin has “become more than a cryptocurrency: it represents a cultural and financial movement that continues to drive mainstream adoption,” said Duncan Moir, President of 21Shares. “With this ETF, DOGE offers investors a regulated avenue to be part of this exciting project.” While the S-1 filing represents a significant first step, 21Shares must still submit a 19b-4 filing—a formal request that the SEC must approve to amend the rules of a national securities exchange to allow the ETF to trade. This is where the process becomes more uncertain, as the SEC has yet to give clear guidance on whether meme coins like Dogecoin meet the criteria for spot ETF approval. Nonetheless, optimism remains high. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have estimated a 75% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Dogecoin ETF this year, reflecting a noticeable shift in regulatory attitudes. On the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, traders currently assign a 64% probability to a DOGE ETF approval in 2025. This environment is ripe for what Seyffart refers to as a “spaghetti cannon approach”, where issuers are testing the limits of what the SEC might approve under the current leadership. “Issuers will try to launch many different things and see what sticks,” Seyffart said in February. Beyond US borders, 21Shares is already taking steps to expand its Dogecoin product suite. Also on April 9, the firm announced the launch of a fully backed Dogecoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, in partnership with House of Doge. This European version of the DOGE fund will trade under the ticker “DOGE” and will carry a 2.5% management fee. By offering the product first in Europe, 21Shares is clearly testing international markets while building momentum ahead of a possible US launch. The firm has followed a similar strategy with its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, some of which launched in Europe well before regulatory approvals came through in the US. The Expanding Crypto ETF Landscape 21Shares is already among the most active players in the crypto ETF arena. Its US offerings currently include only spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs, but its ambition goes far beyond the two leading cryptocurrencies. The company filed for a spot Polkadot (DOT) ETF in February and previously filed for a spot XRP ETF in 2024. Dogecoin , originally launched in 2013 as a satirical response to the wild world of cryptocurrencies, has proven remarkably resilient. What began as a joke has evolved into a cultural and financial force, buoyed by grassroots support, viral online content, and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. A Turning Point for Meme Coins? If approved, the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF would be a watershed moment not only for Dogecoin but for the entire category of meme coins. With regulators seemingly more open to novel crypto assets—and institutional players like Coinbase and 21Shares backing them—Dogecoin might just lead the way in rewriting the rules of what’s considered investable in the world of finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-10 05:30:00

Although ETH has bounced back more than 13% from the lows of $1,400, whales have adopted the sell-on-rise strategy. Trump’s 90-day delay in tariff implementation has given some breather to the market; however, investors are still not gaining confidence over the asset class. Dormant Ethereum Whale Sells $16.86M Worth of ETH A veteran Ethereum investor has sold a massive 10,702 ETH, worth a staggering $16.86 million, at a price of $1,576 per token. Blockchain data reveals that the investor acquired the $ETH as early as 2016, when the cryptocurrency was priced at just $8, as per the Etherscan data . Interestingly, most of the Ethereum whales capitulating today refrained from selling when ETH price was above $4,000 in December last year. This latest transaction marks the holder’s return to activity after two years of dormancy, fueling speculation about the timing and strategy behind the move. Donald Trump’s DeFi project, World Liberty Financial , has also been selling ETH during this panic sell-off. On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez believes that this could be a great time to accumulate ETH. He noted that while the long-term ETH holders are in the capitulation mode, this development could signal a potential accumulation opportunity for contrarian investors. Martinez noted that new buyers have favourable risk-reward dynamics associated with this market condition. Source: Ali Martinez Is ETH Price Ready for A Bullish Reversal? Following the ETH price crash to $1,400 on Tuesday, the altcoin has recovered by a strong 13%, and is currently trading at $1612 levels, with daily trading volumes up by 36%, at over $35 billion. Analysts have started predicting a potential reversal henceforth. Popular crypto analyst Luciano_BTC noted that the chart shows promising signs of an ETH price breakou t after maintaining stability at a critical support level. A falling wedge pattern has emerged, often regarded as a precursor to bullish reversals. Source: Luciano_BTC If the trendline is breached, it could signal substantial upside potential, positioning Ethereum for significant gains. Another positive catalyst for the altcoin is that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved options trading for spot Ether ETF , which could lead to greater institutional participation.

One emerging contender capturing significant attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending and borrowing platform in its presale that is making headlines. The project has attracted more than 8100 investors because it currently sells at $0.025 through Phase 4 and the platform’s overall worth exceeds $6.5 million. Following another market increase the platform price will rise to $0.03 by increasing 20% over current market rates. The initial launch price is $0.06 but Phase 4 investors will recover 140% profit on their $0.025 purchase. Analysts are optimistic about MUTM’s growth trajectory, with some forecasts suggesting the token could reach $1.50 by the end of 2025. This projection represents a 5,900% increase from the current presale price, indicating that an initial investment of $500 could potentially grow to $30,000 within this timeframe. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum The investor sentiment-driven growth of MUTM relies on its basic DeFi lending model which provides its momentum for advancement. Through Phase 4 investors have an opportunity to acquire MUTM tokens at $0.025 yet the value will rise to $0.03 after the following period begins. Strategy-based MUTM investors will achieve a 140% profit estimation while the platform functions at $0.06 market value supported by its strong tokenomic foundation. The funding campaign for MUTM has attracted many investors who pushed the platform’s capitalization beyond $6.5 million thus proving market interest in platforms connecting lending resources to growth potentials. Through its automated Buy-and-Distribute mechanism the ecosystem of MUTM purchases tokens in the market and distributes them to stakers during specific time intervals. The model maintains regular market purchases which stands out as a rare phenomenon against the general volatile and speculative market character. Mutuum Finance is in the process of having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a key measure to enhance security and trust. The official audit report will be published on their social media once completed. Innovative growth strategy Mutuum Finance defines its identity through its development of mtToken technology which serves as an investment token for both ETH and DAI alongside additional deposit assets. They can earn money from interest-accumulating mtTokens while maintaining complete access to their funds. The platform maintains participant deposits within its pool network while giving different APY yield rates to depositors alongside loan functions for users who have assets as collateral. On the platform users obtain $5,000 USDT by depositing $7,000 ETH with an optimized security measure that controls the loan-to-collateral ratio. A smarter alternative to other coins Mutuum Finance maintains its financial operations in a stable long-term pattern. Investors select initiatives with long-term value because the presale operation completes swiftly. An opportunity to buy MUTM for $0.025 will soon cease to exist as specialists project that its market worth will increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a better alternative to Solana and other top-tier cryptos, offering early investors a rare chance at massive returns. With over $6.5 million raised, 8,100+ holders, and a Phase 4 token price of just $0.025, MUTM is gaining rapid traction. A projected price surge to $1.50 by the end of 2025 represents a staggering 5,900% increase, potentially turning a $500 investment into $30,000. As the token prepares to enter Phase 5 at $0.03, time is running out to secure tokens before the price jump. With a CertiK audit underway and a robust DeFi lending infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is built for long-term impact.

In such situations, traders tend to ignore the noise and follow the tape – monitor the price chart, identify the path of least resistance and follow the same. In case of bitcoin (BTC), the tape has turned bullish, with short-duration price charts flashing a pattern opposite of the one that characterized the January-February price peak above $109K. We are talking about the double bottom pattern comprising two consecutive troughs with lows at about the same price, representing downtrend exhaustion, and a trendline drawn through the high point between the two troughs. A move above the trendline, also called the neckline, confirms a breakout and a bullish shift in the market trend. BTC put in a double bottom at around $74,600 between April 7 and April 9, separated by a temporary recovery (high point) to nearly $80,800. On Wednesday, prices rose past that neckline level, confirming the double-bottom breakout. Technical analysis theory suggests adding the gap between troughs and the neckline to the breakout point to gauge the potential upside move, which suggests scope for a BTC price rally to $87,000. As of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $82,000. Supporting the bull case is the appearance of a ""bullish outside day"" candle on the daily chart, suggesting a trend reversal higher. The candle gets its name from its distinctive shape, featuring a green body and wicks that entirely engulf the negative price action of the preceding day. This pattern indicates a strong effort by buyers to reassert control, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment in the market. These bullish signals risk invalidation in case of a renewed move below $75,000. XRP, DOGE recovery may have legs Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP and the leading memecoin by market value, DOGE, surged by 14.3% and 12.7% on Wednesday, respectively, as a renewed uptick in BTC encouraged risk-taking across the broader crypto market. Both cryptocurrencies formed bullish outside day candles, signaling the bulls' efforts to regain market control after an extended sell-off. The pattern suggests potential for continued gains in the short-term.",Markets|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|XRP|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 05:41:34

I still think that’s in play,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in an April 9 blog post. He suggested that the fallout from US President Donald Trump’s global tariff push could be beneficial for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto because his administration “wants a weaker dollar, even if it means ending its role as the world’s reserve currency.” Hougan cited an April 7 speech by Steve Miran, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which criticized the dollar’s reserve status as causing “persistent currency distortions” and “unsustainable trade deficits” that have “decimated” US manufacturing. Hougan said a weaker greenback could have both short-term and long-term implications for Bitcoin. In the short term, dollar weakness historically correlates with Bitcoin strength, he added, citing the US Dollar Index (DXY). “Dollar down equals Bitcoin up,” Hougan said. “I expect this pattern will continue.” BTC prices have generally been historically high when DXY has been historically low. Source: MacroMicro The DXY, which compares the value of the US dollar to a basket of six major currencies, has fallen more than 7% since the beginning of 2025, according to TradingView. In the long term, Hougan said disruption to the global reserve currency system creates opportunities for alternative reserve assets, including Bitcoin and gold. “Governments and companies turn to the dollar for international trade precisely because of its stability. When that stability comes into question, they have to look elsewhere.” The Bitwise executive concluded that the world will move from a single reserve currency to a “more fractured reserve system, with hard money like Bitcoin and gold playing a bigger role than it does today.” Earlier this week, VanEck said that China and Russia were reportedly settling some energy trades in Bitcoin as Trump’s trade war ramps up. On April 9, Trump issued a 90-day pause on nearly all of his earlier announced “reciprocal tariffs,” keeping a baseline 10% tariff on all countries besides China, which he lumped with a 125% tariff. Bitcoin will be the fastest horse Crypto trader and analyst Will Clemente said on X that “Bitcoin will be the fastest horse” coming out of this drawdown. Related: Most opportune time to buy Bitcoin? Now — Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan explains why “It’s a pure reflection of liquidity and no earnings, if anything, economic uncertainty/deglobalization are positive for Bitcoin,” he added. BTC is up 7.5% over the past 24 hours to $81,700. It has seen a correction of around 32% from its Jan. 20 all-time high, in line with pullbacks in previous bull market cycles.

This includes big names like BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, and two from Grayscale — the Grayscale Ethereum Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. What Just Happened? On Wednesday, the SEC announced an “accelerated approval” for Nasdaq ISE’s proposal to allow options trading on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF. Simultaneously, the SEC also approved a request from NYSE American to allow options trading for Bitwise and Grayscale’s Ethereum-based products. In simple terms, this means investors will soon be able to trade options like financial contracts that let you bet on price movements on these Ethereum ETFs, similar to what we already saw earlier with spot Bitcoin ETFs . Why It Matters The approval of options trading adds more flexibility and depth to the crypto investment world. Investors can now hedge their ETH positions or make strategic bets without having to directly buy or sell Ethereum. This move is expected to increase trading activity and make Ethereum ETFs even more appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart wasn’t surprised by the approval, noting it was widely anticipated. Meanwhile, ETF Store President Nate Geraci said even more Ethereum-related products could be on the way, including creative strategies like covered-call ETH ETFs and buffered ETH ETFs. Ethereum Price Reacts ETH had been dropping over the past few days, falling close to $1,400. But following the SEC announcement, it bounced back sharply to around $1,650. It came after it formed a solid base around $1,380, ETH broke past a key bearish trend line and soared to $1,687 before cooling off slightly. It’s now holding steady above $1,550 and the 100-hourly moving average, showing strength. While the price is facing some resistance around $1,650–$1,680, bulls could make another push higher if momentum holds. The news clearly brought fresh optimism into the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today: Trump’s Tariff Pause Sends Bitcoin to $82K , What’s Next? Several issuers are also pushing for permission to stake Ethereum in their ETFs. If allowed, this would mean they could earn extra returns on their ETH and pass those gains onto investors. Seyffart noted that staking decisions could come soon, with key deadlines in May, August, and a final one in October. Hence, in short, Options trading makes Ethereum ETFs more attractive and accessible to a wider group of investors. If staking is allowed too, it could open a whole new income stream. All eyes are now on the SEC’s next moves as Ethereum’s role in traditional finance continues to grow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One such token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has set the crypto world abuzz. The project is currently priced at $0.025 per token in phase 4 of its presale. MUTM has already raised over $6.5 million and has attracted more than 8100 holders within days. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Analysts are predicting that MUTM could surge to $1 before even Dogecoin catches up, potentially skyrocketing to as much as $5 in just 72 days following its official launch.

Now, with renewed focus on early-stage assets, many are asking whether MAGACOINFINANCE could follow a similar trajectory and evolve into a serious contender for long-term appreciation. While major projects like Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink (LINK), and Hedera (HBAR) continue advancing the blockchain ecosystem, it’s the retail-led launch of MAGACOINFINANCE that’s generating attention for its clean structure, strong momentum, and massive upside potential.

The central bank recently decided to sharply slow down its balance sheet reduction, also known as quantitative tightening (QT), dropping Treasury runoff caps from $25 billion to $5 billion per month. While this move had broad support, the minutes show it wasn’t without internal pushback. Some policymakers, including Governor Christopher Waller, weren’t happy with the slowdown and preferred to stay on track with the original QT pace. We have posted the minutes from the #FOMC meeting held March 18-19, 2025: https://t.co/PgN9O5QmoS — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) April 9, 2025 Debt Ceiling Concerns Prompt Policy Shift The slowdown in QT was influenced heavily by ongoing uncertainty around the U.S. debt ceiling. A presentation from a New York Fed official highlighted that slowing the drawdown would act as a buffer, helping preserve liquidity during a period of constrained government borrowing. The Fed aimed to prevent a sharp drop in reserves that could follow a resolution to the debt ceiling situation. In the March 18–19 meeting, the central bank decided to reduce the Treasury runoff limit while maintaining the $35 billion cap on mortgage bond drawdowns. This approach gives the Fed flexibility to manage money market conditions while monitoring the broader economic impact of federal debt management. Fed Signals a Long-Term Shift in Strategy Fed Chair Jerome Powell and New York Fed President John Williams indicated that the reduced pace of QT could continue even after the debt ceiling issue is resolved. Powell emphasized that slowing QT extends the timeline before reserves become scarce, allowing the Fed to make decisions based on a clearer understanding of market conditions. Williams noted that a gradual approach helps avoid unnecessary disruptions and allows time to assess liquidity accurately. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today: Trump’s Tariff Pause Sends Bitcoin to $82K , Crypto Market Reacts Steadily The crypto market remained stable in response to the Fed’s move. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum showed minimal volatility as the decision signaled caution rather than concern. By slowing QT, the Fed is effectively keeping more liquidity in the system, which can be favorable for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies . Although the primary focus remains on the federal funds rate, the Fed’s approach to QT continues to influence broader market sentiment. Analysts now anticipate that QT could extend into next year, especially if financial conditions remain fragile amid global trade uncertainties and potential shifts in U.S. fiscal policy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The SEC needs to “clearly state that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea do not qualify as exchanges under federal securities laws,” OpenSea general counsel Adele Faure and deputy general counsel Laura Brookover said in an April 9 letter to Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the agency’s Crypto Task Force . Faure and Brookover argued that NFT marketplaces don’t meet the legal definition of an exchange under US securities laws as they don’t execute transactions, act as intermediaries or bring together multiple sellers for the same asset. “The Commission’s past enforcement agenda has created uncertainty. We therefore urge the Commission to remove this uncertainty and protect the ability of US technology companies to lead in this space,” Faure and Brookover wrote. OpenSea’s legal team has asked the SEC to issue informal guidance on NFT Marketplaces. Source: SEC “In preparing this guidance, the Crypto Task Force should specifically address the application of exchange regulations to marketplaces for non-fungible assets, similar to the recent staff statements on memecoins and stablecoins,” Faure and Brookover added. Under a notice published on April 4, the SEC said stablecoins that meet specific criteria are considered “non-securities” and are exempt from transaction reporting requirements. Meanwhile, the SEC’s division of corporation finance said in a Feb. 27 staff statement that memecoins are not securities under the federal securities laws but are more akin to collectibles. NFT marketplaces don’t fit broker definition, says OpenSea Faure and Brookover argued the Crypto Task Force should also exempt NFT marketplaces like OpenSea from having to register as a broker, arguing they don’t give investment advice, execute transactions, or custody customer assets. “We ask the SEC to clear the existing industry confusion on this issue by publishing informal guidance. In the longer term, we invite the Commission to exempt NFT marketplaces like OpenSea from proposed broker regulation,” they said.

On April 9, the company file d a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC, outlining plans for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The fund will track the price of Dogecoin ( DOGE ) using the CF DOGE-Dollar US Settlement Price Index as its benchmark, with Coinbase Custody named as the proposed custodian. The ETF is designed as a passive investment vehicle, meaning it won’t use leverage or derivatives. Instead, it will hold actual Dogecoin and calculate its daily net asset value (NAV) based on the benchmark index. The Trust won’t actively trade DOGE, except during share creations and redemptions or to cover certain fees. Further, to strengthen outreach and community engagement, 21Shares has brought on House of Doge, the corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, to support the marketing, branding, and strategic positioning of the ETF within the broader Dogecoin ecosystem.

Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out a bearish verdict for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,710.66 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price dropped over the last 24 hours towards the support at $552.6. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; However, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,710.66 by 2031.

As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB was trading near the psychological mark of $600, which it still continues to do so in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-10 06:10:33

However, this analyst uses Elliot Wave Analysis to predict how low XRP token could drop below $1 before hitting its next double-digit ATH target. XRP Price Prediction & Elliot Wave Analysis: Crash Below $1 Before $20 Target Poular crypto analyst XForced Global posted latest thoughts on XRP price action based on Elliot Wave analysis . The X post notes that the first wave is complete as the token rallied from $0.50 to $3.40. Wave 2 will see Ripple’s value drop down to a buy zone that extends from $1.70 to $1.0 . Due to the inherent volatility, there might be a drop below the $1 psychological level before Wave 3 kickstarts. In Elliot Wave Theory, the third wave is the longest wave, and XForced Global notes that XRP price could hit $20 . If XRP token achieves this ATH , its market cap at the current supply would 10x and hit $1.16 trillion . The fourth wave , according to the analyst, will trigger a correction to roughly $7 before embarking on the final wave that will most likely propel XRP price to $30 . It is unsure if the crypto token will achieve this valuation in the short term; assuming that every aspect of the project goes well, it could take a few years and potentially a decade for XRP to hit $20 or $30. While the long-term outlook for XRP price is extremely bullish and is unrealistic considering the current market conditions, let’s explore short-term XRP price prediction and analysis. XRP Price Analysis For Next Week Between December 3, 2024, and April 3, 2025, XRP price traded in a range, creating a value area extending from $2.11 to $2.60. This area is where 70% of the volume was traded in the past four months. As noted in a previous XRP prediction & analysis , acceptance above the range low of $2.11 could signal strength and potentially propel the price to $2.41 and $2.60 . While the first target is where the highest volume was traded in the past four months, the second target is the range high of the aforementioned value area. XRP/USDT 1-day Chart For the next week, investors can expect one of two things to happen. Acceptance into the value area could lead to a rally to retest targets at $2.41 or $2.60. Rejection at $2.11 could lead to an extended correction to $1.47 . Interestingly, the bearish scenario puts XRP price into the buy zone obtained the aforementioned Elliot Wave analysis . Conclusion: Factors That Could Affect XRP’s Directional Bias There are three key events that could impact XRP price moves. Bitcoin’s price outlook . If BTC shows strength, so will XRP and other altcoins. Macroeconomic outlook involving the Fed and policy changes it makes. If the Fed decides to cut interest rates, it could provide prompt a risk-on scenario that pushes stock markets and crypto markets higher. Such a development could see price catalyze an acceptance into the value area and revisit $2.60. US President Donald Trump’s trade war. If the trade war between China and USA cools off, it could allow the stock and crypto markets to flourish.

(MSTR) stock soared 24.76% to $296.86 following President Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except China. The move sparked a broader rally in U.S.-listed stocks, with MSTR leading the pack. Investors poured in as easing trade tensions fueled optimism in both crypto and traditional markets. The Nasdaq jumped 10%, and the S&P 500 rose 8%. After-hours trading saw a slight dip, with MSTR settling at $292.00. April 10, 2025 05:58:26 UTC Trump Pauses Nvidia H20 Chip Ban After Mar-a-Lago Dinner The Trump administration has paused the planned export restrictions on Nvidia’s H20 AI chip to China following a Mar-a-Lago dinner attended by CEO Jensen Huang. The decision came after Nvidia pledged new U.S. investments. Previously expected curbs drew bipartisan pressure amid China’s AI advancements. Despite political opposition, regulatory delays and staff shortages slowed action. Analysts see the move as a win for China, still reliant on advanced U.S. chips. The White House and Nvidia declined to comment on this. April 10, 2025 05:48:55 UTC Bitcoin Holds Strong Amid Global Tensions: What Recent Dips Really Mean Bitcoin’s sharp 53% drop during China’s mining ban revealed how technological crackdowns can severely impact the market. In contrast, external economic pressures like Trump’s tariff war led to only a 28% correction, showing Bitcoin’s resilience to geopolitical tensions. The current dip is seen as healthy consolidation rather than a sign of crisis. This reflects a shift in sentiment—investors are now less shaken by global events.

In a dramatic turnaround, the broader crypto market experienced a significant relief rally yesterday, with the prices of most assets soaring to lofty heights. XRP was not left out in the latest surge, as it rose above the $2 territory. XRP Rebounds Above $2 The rebound comes days after XRP plunged to a multi-month low of $1.6401 on April 7 as ongoing tariff tensions escalated. This escalated tension prompted investors to retreat from risky assets, including crypto. Since the decline, XRP's initial attempts to recover above $2 were unsuccessful. However, yesterday, XRP finally succeeded in breaking past the $2 territory. This comes after XRP’s price surged 15.3% to hit a daily high of $2.08 on April 9. Only Reason Behind XRP's Surge Some enthusiasts have attributed XRP’s recent price gains to several factors, particularly the resolution of the SEC lawsuit and Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road. However, the major reason behind the surge is an announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump. The president issued a statement yesterday that temporarily halted all ‘reciprocal’ tariffs for 90 days. This indicates that the U.S. issued a three-month pause on tariffs it initially imposed in response to other countries' tariffs. During this period, the U.S. will lower its reciprocal tariffs to 10%. However, the U.S. President excluded China from this benevolence. Instead, he raised China’s tariffs to 125%, noting that the increment was ‘based on the lack of respect the country has shown the world markets.’ Interestingly, major assets, including XRP, soared on the news. Bitcoin, which initially crashed to $74,400 on Monday amid the tariff tension, rebounded nicely to above $82,000.Meanwhile, XRP has retraced slightly to $2.03 in the hours leading up to press time. With its 24-hour gains at 12.4%, XRP remains down 3.35% in the past week and 5.06% in 30 days.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-04-10 06:17:27

Currently, XRP is trading at $1.7, reflecting a slight decrease of 20.21% from the last 24 hours. In parallel, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, is garnering attention for its potential explosive growth. The project is in phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $6.5 million with over 8100 investors already onboard. In phase 5 the price will jump 20% to $0.03. MUTM could hit $5 and be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Transforming DeFi lending with a hybrid model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive rewards and community incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. A strategic vision for sustainable growth Mutuum Finance created its tokenomics framework to promote sustainable value through proper management of liquidity and strategic partnerships and security features with anti-inflation measures. The basis for enduring token price appreciation comes from a controlled distribution process during the presale phase alongside proper management techniques. The payout system for token staking pumps out steady passive revenue which retains both investors’ commitment and protects token sustainability levels. The deflationary mechanisms function over time to reduce network supply which leads to increased scarcity thereby strengthening price growth potential for the long term. While Ripple (XRP) may reach $5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a faster path to explosive growth from under $0.05. With over $6.5 million raised and 8,100 investors onboard, Mutuum’s unique lending model and strong security measures position it for major gains. As the presale price rises in Phase 5, early investors could see significant returns. Join the presale now and capitalize on this exciting DeFi opportunity.

Known for his short-term trading predictions, il Capo says the scale of what’s coming requires a broader perspective. In a detailed message shared with his followers, the analyst noted that it was important to balance adaptability with strategic foresight. “If you are not mentally or strategically prepared, the scale of what could happen could really catch you off guard,” he warned. Revisiting macroeconomic trends that began during the COVID-19 pandemic, il Capo viewed the Fed’s multitrillion-dollar stimulus as a temporary fix that postpones rather than prevents a larger crash. He sees it as an artificial rally driven by excess liquidity, ETFs, and stablecoin printing as markets, including BTC, reach new highs. “Interest rates are now starting to fall,” he noted, adding: “Historically, that would indicate a recession.” He suggests the world is heading toward a full-scale economic reset akin to the Great Depression of 1929, with the potential for a dramatic shift toward a digital financial system, including widespread adoption of central bank digital currencies and the ISO 20022 infrastructure. Il Capo predicts that this transformation could begin to occur between late 2025 and early 2026, echoing what some have called the Great Reset. Although markets have recently recovered after a 90-day halt to tariffs, il Capo sees it as short-term relief. Citing billionaire investor Ray Dalio, he argues that tariffs are “a distraction from what really matters.” il Capo listed his predictions about the market as follows: Very Short Term (Next Few Days) BTC could rise to the $92,000-$98,000 range. Altcoins may see a 50%-100% recovery. The market is responding positively to the customs duty postponement. Short Term (Next Few Weeks) Resistance can lead to capitulation. Possible triggers: new tariffs, escalation of conflict or health concerns. Flexibility and rapid response will be key. Medium Term (until September 2025) The upward trend is expected to continue. There is potential for an altseason, but it is milder than 2021 or 2017. Overly bearish outlooks could miss out on strong accumulation opportunities. Black swan events can develop long-term value zones. Long Term (end of 2025 to 2026) Signals indicate that a major downturn is imminent. BTC’s rally is seen as artificial and altcoins are lagging dangerously behind. September 2025 has been identified as a potential cyclical reversal, likened to the November 2021 peak. A true global crisis could unleash extreme volatility, testing BTC’s resilience like never before. “We have never seen Bitcoin behave like this during a real depression,” he warned, adding: “If that happens, expect the worst part of the cycle.” Despite the gloomy weather, il Capo encourages his followers to remain vigilant but open to opportunities. The coming months could still offer favorable conditions for selective gains, especially as markets remain oversold across many sectors. *This is not investment advice.

The memecoin, which is associated with First Lady Melania Trump , has failed to gain significant traction akin to the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin . Moreover, the latter has maintained a market cap and a fully diluted valuation of above $1 billion after launch, but MELANIA’s keeps on declining. As of this writing, MELANIA had an FDV of about $515 million and a reported 24-hour average trading volume of around $22.77 million. MELANIA Whales Keeps Dumping The MELANIA meme project has heavily been criticized for its low community engagement after its hyped launch. In the past few months, on-chain data shows early adopters of MELANIA have been dumping, thus weighing down on bullish recovery. Source : lookonchain X Post According to on-chain data analysis from Lookonchain, the MELANIA team has been offloading their holdings through tampering with the liquidity pools. Precisely, the MELANIA token team sold 6.72 million tokens for 34,168 Solana (SOL) coins, during the last 25 days. Lookonchain noted that the MELANIA team has been adding and removing liquidity across 8 wallets in the recent past. Midterm Market Expectations Following the strategic move by the Donald Trump administration to pause reciprocal tariffs , with the exception of China, for 90 days, the wider crypto market has signaled bullish sentiment akin to the stock markets. Moreover, Trump posted on TruthSocial that more great days are coming after Wednesday’s moves. As a result, the MELANIA price, in the 1-hour timeframe, has formed a potential reversal pattern, characterized by an inverted head and shoulder pattern coupled with a bullish divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

Bitcoin rose over 7% as it regained its $80K levels while the broader crypto market followed suit. XRP and Ether were the top gainers among major crypto tokens with an impressive 12% surge while Cardano, BNB, SOL and DOGE witnessed gains as much as 10%. The overall market cap also rose to 6%. Markets Recover Earlier Losses Crypto futures saw over $350 million in short liquidations, which helped the market recover some losses from earlier this week when Bitcoin dipped to $75,000. Such liquidations can be a buying opportunity which signals that market is now settling back to fair levels. This rally comes after Trump paused steeper tariffs on all countries except China which eased global tensions and recession fears. In a Truth Social post , Trump declared that he had “ authorized a 90-day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately .” Besides the tariff on China would rise to 125% once the pause ends. Notably, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that the tariff pause was always part of the strategy to push the countries into negotitations. But Trump changed his stance just a day after new tariffs hit, as markets crashed wiping out trillions in value and U.S. bond yields spiked, which might have prompted this. Biggest Surge In US Stock Notably, this move triggered the biggest surge in US stock since 2008, with the S&P 500 jumping 9.5% and the Nasdaq rose 12%, lifting markets out of the slump. This move could be a temporary measure to ease the market pressures without giving up leverage, which provides businesses a short term sense of stability. Experts believe that markets are rising in expectations of trade deals with the US in an effort to avoid a full-blown trade war. The ongoing US-China tariffs could drastically change the global trade in a big way and the after-effects will unfold in the coming months. Negotiations Bring Some Hope Notably, Jupiter Zheng of HashKey Capital believes the market may have hit a local bottom. The recent upswing might be fueled by the optimism that the worst has already passed. While risks like China’s potential retaliation to Trump’s 125% tariffs still loom, the negotiations with other countries bring some hope. Besides, he also pointed towards the favourable US crypto regulations signalling that Bitcoin and other cryptos might have already hit their lows. Market may not have fully priced in these positive developments which suggests that there could still be room for growth, unless no shocks emerge. How did trump’s sudden move affect the overall crypto market? The news led to a 7% surge in Bitcoin back to $82K and lifted the entire crypto market. Coins like ETH, ADA, BNB, and SOL gained around 10%, and total crypto market cap rose by 6%. What exactly did Trump announce about tariffs? Trump announced a 90-day pause on steep tariffs for all countries except China. During this time, a reduced reciprocal tariff rate of 10% would apply.

US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% Wednesday after Beijing announced a 50% duty increase on US goods, causing the onshore yuan to tumble to lows seen last in 2007. Beijing’s countermeasure, an 84% blanket tariff on US goods, took effect on Thursday and immediately shook currency markets. The Chinese yuan fell to its weakest level in more than 18 years. BREAKING: China's retaliatory 84% tariffs on US imports have gone into effect — The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) April 10, 2025 The onshore yuan closed domestic trading at 7.3498 per USD, the lowest since December 2007, while the offshore yuan hovered around 7.36. The rapid depreciation followed two consecutive months of deflation in China, with March consumer prices dropping 0.1% year-on-year. February had seen a steeper 0.7% fall, adding to the government’s list of problems that include weakening domestic demand in the face of trade headwinds. Capital market jitters prompt emergency measures According to sources familiar with the matter, cited by Cryptopolitan, top Chinese officials convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss policy changes to prop up the economy. Beijing is expected to roll out additional fiscal support to counteract the damage caused by reduced trade volumes. In tandem, the People’s Bank of China set the midpoint rate, the benchmark from which the onshore yuan can trade within a 2% band, at 7.2066 per dollar, the lowest since September 2023. That allowed for a lower floor of 7.3507, just above the previous low seen last year. Still, both onshore and offshore yuan values have fallen more than 1% in April. Market observers saw the central bank’s stronger-than-expected midpoint fixing as a sign that authorities do not want a sharp yuan depreciation, even in a trade standoff with the US. On other currencies, the US dollar dropped 0.7% to 146.68 yen and lost 0.62% against the Swiss franc, trading at 0.8522. The euro rose 0.32% to $1.0985. The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for Chinese economic health, saw sharp swings. It initially slipped 0.33% to $0.6132 and had fallen as much as 0.5% earlier in the day. However, by Thursday morning, the Aussie rebounded by 3.3% after briefly touching a five-year low at $0.5910. Breaking a multi-billion trade deficit In 2024, the total value of goods traded between the two countries reached $688.28 billion, according to United Nations data. This figure is 275 times higher than the level in 1979, when diplomatic ties were first established, and over eight times larger than in 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization. China is still the United States’ second-largest source of imports and third-largest export destination. US goods exports to China accounted for 7% of total US exports in 2024, while imports from China made up 13.8% of total imports. On the flip side, China sent 14.7% of its total exports to the US and sourced 6.3% of its imports from it. Analysts say the practical effect of tariffs may be limited because China imports approximately $160 billion worth of goods from the US annually and exports over $400 billion. “ I don’t think they can match economically ,” said Rick Waters, director of the Carnegie China think tank in Singapore. “ So what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price .” China could also direct its anger to America’s services sector, where the North holds a relative advantage. Washington consistently records a surplus of services with China in finance, law, and consulting. A report by China’s State Council released Wednesday identified China as the US’s fifth-largest service export market. Beijing could respond by restricting US companies from participating in government procurement or limiting their cooperation with Chinese firms to tighten the screws on American service providers operating in China. China commission to sue the US China’s Customs Tariff Commission believes Trump is making a “mistake upon another mistake” by adding a 125% levy on the Asian country and pausing duties on other jurisdictions. In a statement released Wednesday, the Commission urged America to resolve disputes through “equal dialogue based on mutual respect.” Beijing also filed a new complaint with the World Trade Organization, accusing the United States of “bullying China.” “ We believe Beijing views these US trade actions as nothing short of a declaration of economic war ,” Analysts from BCA Research said in a note to clients. “ Chinese authorities will allow the yuan to depreciate materially. The US-China confrontation is set to escalate from here. ” “ It seems likely that the US President blinked when confronted with a potential recession, a political backlash, a near equity bear market, and the early warning signs of a financial crisis ,” said Kyle Rodda, an analyst at Capital.com. “ Even if President Trump does cut deals with trading partners ,” Rodda added, “ there’s harm that’s been done to the markets and the US economy that will take time to heal from .” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Claver outlined the significance of the acquisition, emphasizing its implications for institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , as well as for the broader use of XRP and Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. According to Claver, this acquisition marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Ripple’s ecosystem, particularly in how it addresses institutional finance. Ripple just dropped $1.25 BILLION to buy Hidden Road, a prime brokerage that moves $3 trillion annually. But why should XRP holders care? Because it's about to change everything for #XRP and #RLUSD . Let’s talk about why. 1/19 pic.twitter.com/wLPFNADyn6 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) April 8, 2025 Institutional Scale Meets On-Chain Settlement Claver highlighted that Hidden Road serves over 300 institutional clients, with $10 billion in daily trading activity. These trades will now have the option to be settled directly on the XRP Ledger. As Claver pointed out, this is not retail volume—it is institutional capital handled by hedge funds and market makers. With a portion of this $10 billion in daily trades potentially settling through XRP, demand for the asset is positioned to rise significantly. Each transaction on the XRP Ledger requires XRP, and institutions operating at this scale will require large quantities to support settlement operations. Ripple’s acquisition also directly connects traditional financial operations to the benefits of blockchain. Hidden Road’s decision to integrate RLUSD as collateral across all its prime brokerage products represents the first stablecoin enabling cross-margining between digital and traditional markets. According to Claver, this effectively creates an interoperable financial system underpinned by digital assets, offering instant settlement through XRP and stable collateral via RLUSD. Solving Longstanding Industry Pain Points Claver stated that the move addresses several key concerns from institutional players, including regulatory compliance, settlement risk, and capital inefficiency. Ripple’s existing portfolio of over 60 licenses, combined with XRPL’s settlement speed , offers a solution to these barriers. The instant finality of transactions on XRPL contrasts sharply with the 24-hour-plus settlement cycles typical in traditional markets. This shift could significantly alter how institutions handle post-trade operations, particularly in terms of speed, cost, and risk mitigation. According to Claver, Trust is a major factor. Hidden Road’s institutional clients rely on the firm for large-scale financial operations. With Ripple now owning that infrastructure, these same clients will gain exposure to and potentially build trust in XRP and RLUSD as integrated components of the financial workflows they already utilize. Economic Efficiency and Market Expansion Another critical element in Claver’s analysis is cost savings. Settling through XRPL reduces operational expenses for financial institutions. Hidden Road, now backed by Ripple, can pass these savings to clients, increasing its competitiveness. This economic advantage will likely encourage greater adoption and higher transaction volumes, reinforcing demand for XRP and RLUSD. The acquisition also opens new use cases. XRP can facilitate r eal-time cross-border settlements , while RLUSD provides a reliable instrument for liquidity management and hedging. These functionalities expand what financial institutions can accomplish within the Ripple ecosystem. As institutions engage with XRP and RLUSD more frequently, liquidity improves, volatility decreases, and the assets become more attractive for further integration. Positioning at the Intersection of TradFi and DeFi Claver emphasized the strategic nature of the acquisition. By purchasing Hidden Road, Ripple is no longer waiting for institutions to adopt its technology—it now owns a platform already processing more financial volume daily than most blockchains do in an entire month. With that infrastructure under its control, Ripple can directly plug XRPL and RLUSD into the operations of major financial firms. This removes adoption friction and expands Ripple’s institutional reach in one move. Ripple is now positioned to offer a comprehensive end-to-end financial solution: from trade execution and collateralization to instant settlement, all within the same ecosystem. Claver described this as a fundamental shift in how XRP and RLUSD are perceived and used in global finance. A Signal of Long-Term Commitment Concluding his analysis, Claver remarked that the $1.25 billion investment sends a clear signal of Ripple’s confidence in XRP and RLUSD as essential components of future finance. Every transaction processed through XRPL increases the demand for XRP. Every client using RLUSD for collateral enhances the stablecoin’s utility. This ecosystem, as Claver explained, is no longer theoretical—it is being actively built and deployed. In Claver’s view, skeptics of XRP’s institutional potential now face a new reality. Ripple owns a pipeline moving $3 trillion annually. The pipeline is being redirected through the XRPL. With infrastructure, regulatory licenses, and institutional relationships now under its umbrella, Ripple is establishing a new standard for digital asset integration in global financial markets.

The crypto market still struggles to recover from the trade war. More importantly, the fear is building as Donald Trump has increased the tariff on China to 125%. In contrast, China has implemented an 85% tariff on US imports, intensifying the US-China trade war situation. In this turmoil, the cryptos could face further uncertainty and even collapse. Top 4 Altcoins to Sell Amid US-China Trade War The US-China tariff trade war has become one of the most bearish factors for the crypto market. All the digital assets, including Bitcoin, are struggling with extreme whale movements and downtrends. More importantly, the recovery is vague, so consider FTX Token (FTT), Toncoin (TON), Shiba Inu, Pi Coin, and a few other altcoins to sell. 1. FTX Token (FTT) FTT faced a massive downtrend with the collapse of the FTX exchange. More importantly, its recovery from the drop is still vague, with the prime being 98.93% away from current levels. Now, the risk is building as Binance’s ‘vote to delist’ includes this struggling altcoin. If that happens, the token may face a further downtrend. 2. Toncoin (TON) In early 2024, TON was among the best-performing cryptos , but that changed with the regulatory issues with Telegram and Pavel Durov. As a result, it crashed and has been under consolidation ever since, making it among the top choices for altcoins to sell. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu is known as the second biggest and top meme coin but is under scrutiny due to the declining demand for these meme-themed cryptos. Experts believe that these cryptos may never make a complete recovery from their drops as they lack utility and trend and face high competition. At present, the SHIB price is on the recovery trail but may crash amid the US-China trade war, making it the right time to sell along with other struggling cryptos. 4. Pi Coin (PI) Pi Coin is often a topic of discussion, as the crypto community is split between calling it the scam coin and the profitable coin. Since its launch, it has witnessed a significant uptrend, gaining investors’ attention, but the downfalls were also persistent. With regulatory concerns and Binance’s pending listing, its credibility is low. Bottom Line The recent crypto market crash has been in constant turmoil for weeks, losing billions in liquidations. Many digital assets have lost all the gains they made during the Trump presidency-influenced bull run, and if the US-China trade war continues, the loss can extend. As a result, investors must consider struggling altcoins like FTT, Shiba Inu, and others to sell.

According to CoinGecko, Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) shot up by 43.5%, hitting a 10-week high market cap of $731 million. Popcat ( POPCAT ), Ket (KET), and Mog Coin ( MOG ) weren’t far behind, jumping 28.6%, 26.2%, and 24.1%, respectively. Even the bigger names like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) saw a boost—DOGE went up 9.5%, SHIB gained 10.5%, and PEPE climbed 9.5%. Overall, the memecoin market surged 10.6% in the last 24 hours, bringing the total market cap to $46.8 billion. The rally kicked off after Trump announced on April 9 via Truth Social that he was pausing his recently announced aggressive tariff policies for 90 days. He’s also temporarily lowered the reciprocal tariff to 10% while trade talks continue.

Despite yesterday’s pause, tariffs on Chinese imports did go up to 125%, adding more tension between the U.S. and China. That said, China’s Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, said they’re open to resolving things through negotiations, which gave investors some relief. This has brought relief to investors who have taken a risk-on sentiment as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index went up ten points to 25. Memecoins rallied alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ), which has continued to act as the dominant market force with a 62.6% market share as it climbed past $83,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ), the largest altcoin, climbed back above $1,600. The total crypto market cap recovered 5% to $2.68 trillion in the same period. Still, with Bitcoin dominance holding strong, most analysts agree that a true altcoin season, where capital rotates into altcoins and memecoins see sustained, independent rallies, won’t begin until BTC starts to lose its grip .

Analysts point to fading social media hype — and a glaring lack of real-world utility — as reasons for the memecoin’s freefall, which also revealed its vulnerability to sudden sell-offs. As Phase 4 of the sale progresses at $0.025 per token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still attracting capital, and its presales have passed $6.5 million. As Phase 5 is set to increase prices by 20%, investors are focusing on projects that bring innovation together with real financial structures. Pepe’s Downward Spiral Pepe’s fall exposes deeper structural fissures. Riding initially high on meme-driven ambitions, the token now struggles with cooling community interest and vague development aims. Whaled out quickly, skeptical of its speculative underpinning and lack of problem-solving use cases. Pepe lacks the lending or yield mechanisms that decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are built on, and instead depends entirely on cultural significance — a plan experts label as “economically unsustainable.” PEPE has been trending downward since the recent peak in 2025 and as such, it is struggling to hold down on its recent trading charts showing PEPE down 64% down from its recent peak in 2025. Analysts say recovery is unlikely unless ecosystems are upgraded immediately. “Tokens based only on virality tend to never recover,” says a veteran crypto strategist. “Investors are now focused on protocols that offer utility, not just internet fads.” This echoes across exchanges, with PEPE’s trading volume left to die alongside its price. The Presale Momentum of Mutuum Finance Instead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking advantage of DeFi’s move toward functional ecosystems. Over 8,100 holders have already signed up for the presale ($0.025) with 395 million tokens sold. The lending infrastructure of the project—allowing for collateralized loans and passive income through mtTokens—appeals to investors looking for stability. Phase 5 raises the token price to $0.03, which would give current buyers an immediate 20% profit. Mutuum Finance has a $0.06 listing target, which means that early participants can lock away as much as 140% returns at launch. After the initial onslaught of buying, MUTM looks to fly, some very early estimations range up towards $1.50 and $3.50 as platform use takes off. These percentages mean possible 2,300% to 5,900% ROI for those coming in Phase 4, far outstripping typical market returns. Built-In Demand Drivers The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance engineer perpetual buy pressure. A portion of platform fees are paid out for automatic MUTM buybacks which redistribute tokens to mtToken stakers. This mechanism reduces supply and encourages long-term holding — directly opposed to memecoins’ volatility. Also its overcollateralized lending model minimizes default risks, which is a siren song to institutional players eyeing growth of DeFi. Security is a priority with Mutuum Finance completing a Certik audit to invalidate the authenticity of the smart contract. Official channels are slated to announce results, due any time now—undoubtedly building confidence in traders. Timing the Opportunity The window for Phase 4 of the Mutuum Finance project is closing. The entry point of $0.025 — some 20% below where it will enter its next phase — is the last low-cost opportunities before exchange listings. Historical data has shown that presale tokens usually skyrocket after launch, especially ones that come with audited contracts and buy pressure mechanics. As Pepe’s community scrambles for the exits, meet Mutuum Finance (MUTM): the new DeFi blueprint for sustainable growth. The combination of lending utility, utilities from strategic token burns, and transparent roadmaps means it is set not only to survive, but thrive in 2025’s changing landscape. Become one of 8,100+ investors leveraging Mutuum Finance’s Phase 4 presale. Buy at $0.025 for MUTM before Phase 5 which will lift the price to $0.03. Get in now at the official website.

The last three hours of trading proved pivotal, as stocks responded sharply to Trump’s Truth Social post outlining his decision to delay the enforcement of “reciprocal tariffs” and instead impose a uniform 10% tariff—excluding China, which now faces a hefty 125% rate due to its retaliatory trade policies. Among the biggest beneficiaries was Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR), which closed the day up 24.76% at $296.86. Coinbase (COIN), one of the leading crypto exchanges, followed closely with a 17% surge, ending at $177.09. The rally extended to miners as well, with Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) jumping 17%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) adding 16.59%, and Riot Platforms (RIOT) climbing 12.77%. The broader US stock market rallied in tandem. The S&P 500 posted a stunning 9.52% gain—its third-largest single-day jump since the Second World War. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outpaced it, ending the session with a 12.02% increase. Crypto Joins the Global Recovery The impact of the tariff pause wasn’t limited to equities. Bitcoin also staged a notable rebound , rising 7.52% over the past 24 hours to trade at $82,065, according to CoinMarketCap. The turnaround comes after weeks of uncertainty sparked by Trump’s earlier tariff threats, which in February dragged Bitcoin below the $100,000 mark. The most damaging blow came on April 4, when a more aggressive executive order tanked U.S. markets by $3.25 trillion—surpassing the entire crypto market cap at the time. That two-day stretch left investors rattled. However, the latest pivot from the White House appears to have tempered fears for now, restoring optimism in both traditional and digital markets. Asia Pacific Opens Strong Ripple effects from the U.S. surge have already begun to show in the Asia-Pacific region. As markets opened on April 10, Australia’s ASX 200 was up 4.55%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped nearly 10%. This global relief rally suggests that investors are breathing easier—for now—thanks to Trump’s softened tone and the cooling of what many feared could become a full-scale trade war.

Sustainable tokenomics for long-term growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term.

43159403,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148158,1744270512,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: OpenSea Demands SEC Clarity on NFT Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/opensea-demands-sec-nft-regulation/,"Navigating the burgeoning world of NFTs can feel like charting unknown waters, especially when it comes to regulation. Leading NFT marketplace OpenSea is now at the forefront, urging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide much-needed clarity. This move could redefine how NFT marketplaces operate and impact the future of digital asset trading. Let’s dive into why OpenSea is making this urgent plea and what it means for the crypto community. The Core Issue: Defining NFT Marketplaces Under Existing Regulations At the heart of OpenSea’s request is a fundamental question: How should NFT marketplaces be classified under current securities laws? In a detailed letter addressed to Hester Peirce, a key figure in the SEC’s Cryptocurrency Task Force, OpenSea articulated its position. They argue that existing regulations, specifically the Exchange Act, don’t neatly apply to NFT marketplaces due to the unique nature of NFT transactions. Here’s a breakdown of OpenSea’s main arguments: Decentralized Transactions: OpenSea emphasizes that NFT transactions are executed via immutable smart contracts. This means the platform doesn’t operate in the same way as traditional exchanges with “multiple sellers” actively managed by a central entity. No Investment Solicitation: OpenSea asserts it doesn’t solicit investments or act as an agent guiding users towards specific investment opportunities. It provides a platform for users to interact directly through self-executing code. Not Broker-Dealers: Based on the above points, OpenSea contends that it shouldn’t be classified as an exchange or broker-dealer under securities laws. They are seeking explicit confirmation from the SEC on this interpretation. This isn’t just about semantics; it’s about establishing a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting users. The current ambiguity leaves NFT marketplaces in a legal grey area, potentially stifling growth and creating uncertainty for participants. Why is SEC Clarity on NFT Regulation So Crucial? The SEC’s stance on NFT regulation carries significant weight. Clarity in this area is not just beneficial for platforms like OpenSea but for the entire NFT ecosystem. Let’s explore why this regulatory clarity is so vital: Encourages Innovation: Clear rules of the game allow for sustainable innovation. When NFT marketplaces understand the regulatory boundaries, they can confidently develop new features and services without fear of unexpected legal repercussions. Attracts Institutional Investment: Institutional investors often shy away from markets with regulatory uncertainty. Clear cryptocurrency regulation , specifically for NFTs, can pave the way for larger institutional participation, bringing more capital and stability to the NFT space. Protects Users: Appropriate regulation, when clearly defined, is essential for user protection. It can help establish standards for transparency, security, and fair practices within NFT marketplaces . Global Market Harmonization: SEC guidance can influence global regulatory approaches. Clarity in the US market, a significant player in the crypto world, can set a precedent for other jurisdictions, fostering a more harmonized global NFT regulation landscape. OpenSea’s Perspective: More Than Just a Marketplace? OpenSea’s argument hinges on its interpretation of its role in the NFT ecosystem. They position themselves as a technology provider, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions rather than operating as a traditional financial intermediary. Let’s delve deeper into OpenSea ’s operational model and their claims: Feature OpenSea’s Claim Traditional Exchange Model Transaction Processing Via immutable smart contracts Centralized order book and matching engine Seller Interaction Platform provider, not direct seller Directly facilitates and manages seller activities Investment Advice Does not provide investment advice May offer investment products or recommendations Role Technology platform Financial intermediary, potentially broker-dealer or exchange By highlighting these distinctions, OpenSea aims to differentiate itself from entities traditionally regulated by the SEC. Their argument is that applying securities laws designed for conventional exchanges to decentralized NFT marketplaces like theirs is a regulatory mismatch. The SEC Investigation and What’s Next for NFT Marketplaces It’s noteworthy that the SEC previously conducted an investigation into OpenSea, which was closed in February. While the details of this investigation remain undisclosed, its closure could be interpreted as a positive sign for OpenSea. However, the broader question of cryptocurrency regulation , particularly for NFTs, remains open. Looking ahead, several potential scenarios could unfold: SEC Provides Explicit Guidance: The SEC could issue formal guidance clarifying how existing securities laws apply to NFT marketplaces. This is what OpenSea is hoping for and would bring much-needed certainty. New Regulatory Framework: Recognizing the unique nature of NFTs, the SEC might develop a new regulatory framework specifically tailored for digital assets. This could involve creating new categories and rules that address the specific characteristics of NFT marketplaces . Continued Ambiguity: The SEC might choose to maintain the current level of ambiguity, potentially taking enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis. This scenario would likely prolong uncertainty and could stifle innovation. Legislative Action: Ultimately, comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation , including for NFTs, might require legislative action from Congress to create a clear and modern legal framework. Actionable Insights: Navigating the NFT Regulatory Landscape For those involved in the NFT space—creators, collectors, marketplaces, and investors—understanding the evolving regulatory landscape is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments from the SEC and other relevant bodies. Follow industry news and legal analyses to understand potential changes in NFT regulation . Engage in Dialogue: Participate in industry discussions and forums focused on regulatory issues. Contributing to the conversation can help shape future policies. Seek Legal Counsel: If you are operating an NFT marketplace or involved in significant NFT activities, consult with legal professionals specializing in cryptocurrency and securities law to ensure compliance and mitigate risks. Advocate for Clarity: Support industry initiatives that advocate for clear and sensible cryptocurrency regulation . Clarity benefits all stakeholders in the long run. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for NFT Regulation OpenSea’s urgent call for SEC clarity marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of NFT regulation . The outcome of this dialogue will not only shape the future of OpenSea but also the broader NFT ecosystem. As the digital asset space continues to mature, establishing a clear and balanced regulatory framework is essential to unlock its full potential while safeguarding users and fostering sustainable growth.

The 11 bitcoin ETFs lost a net $127.2 million Wednesday, with investors withdrawing $89.7 million from BlackRock's IBIT alone, according to data from Farside Investors. Wednesday marked the fifth consecutive day of outflows, with the funds losing a cumulative $722 million over the period. Ether ETFs have also fallen out of investor favor and the nine funds saw a net outflow of $11.2 million Wednesday. The dwindling demand can be attributed to the macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the U.S.-China trade tensions and volatility in the bond markets that likely led to macro investors selling every asset, including crypto ETFs, for cash. Markets bounced back sharply later Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for more than 75 nations that did not retaliate to his sweeping duties announced a week ago. However, China, which recently placed steeped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, did not get any relief, as Trump hiked the total levy on Chinese goods to 125%.

On-chain analysts predict more community tokens will be sold by the team. According to Lookonchain , the MELANIA ( MELANIA ) team has been adding and removing liquidity across eight different wallets. Within the past month, the team has swapped 6.72 million tokens for 34,168 SOL ( SOL ), earning them profit of $4.2 million in total. On-chain sleuths believe that this is part of an even broader attempt to off-load more tokens from the project’s community funds. On-chain analysis from Bubblemaps shows that the team behind the First Lady’s meme coin has been selling off the community’s tokens over the past few months. Only a week ago, the team offloaded $2 million worth of tokens from community funds in a single-sided liquidity sale. Bubblemaps alleged that the team has been quietly selling a huge chunk of its tokens without any clear explanation. “Huge sell-offs on $MELANIA $30M was moved from community funds — and is now being quietly sold, with no explanation from the team,” wrote the account in a recent post .

Among those addresses, two wallets opened up new positions on-chain worth $6 million each. Not only that, another wallet also sent $3 million worth of crypto funds to exchanges and $500,000 worth of tokens were sold off. 1/ Huge sell-offs on $MELANIA $30M was moved from community funds — and is now being quietly sold, with no explanation from the team 🧵 pic.twitter.com/UbhAqiiW61 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) April 7, 2025 This surge of on-chain activity from team wallets has led the analytics platform to believe the team has plans to off-load more tokens.

The Cardano founder indicated he believes adoption by major technology companies and clearer regulations will drive the next wave of growth in the cryptocurrency market. Speaking to CNBC during the “Beyond the Valley” podcast, Hoskinson said investors are likely to adjust to the current macroeconomic environment, including rising geopolitical tensions and shifts in US trade policy. He added that once markets stabilize and the US Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, capital would start flowing back into digital assets. “The markets will stabilize a little bit, and they’ll get used to the new normal, and then the Fed will lower interest rates, and then you’ll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it’ll pour into crypto,” he said. Bitcoin to hit $250,000 this year and Magnificent 7 to adopt stablecoins, Cardano founder predicts https://t.co/OoHgwxRH4m — CNBC (@CNBC) April 10, 2025 Hoskinson Remains Bullish Despite Volatility and Sharp Market Swings Hoskinson made the comments before US President Donald Trump announced a temporary pause on a new round of global tariffs . The move came after days of volatility in equity and crypto markets. Bitcoin dropped below US$77,000 earlier in the week but rebounded above $82,000 following the pause . Despite the recovery, the assets remains well below its record high above $100,000 in January. Hoskinson, who also helped launch Ethereum and now leads Input Output, pointed to several reasons for his bullish view. This includes the growing number of cryptocurrency users around the world. Data from Crypto.com shows ownership was up 13% year on year in 2024 to 659m. Hoskinson Predicts Big Tech Will Turn to Stablecoins for Global Payments He also argued that global instability is pushing countries away from traditional systems and making decentralised options more attractive. “If Russia wants to invade Ukraine, it invades Ukraine. If China wants to invade Taiwan, it’s going to do that. So treaties don’t really work so well, and global business doesn’t really work so well there. So your only option for globalisation is crypto,” Hoskinson said. Legislative efforts in the US could also play a key role. Hoskinson expects new bills on stablecoins and digital asset market structure to pass in the coming months. These laws could provide clarity for investors and open the door for mainstream adoption. Hoskinson believes that the largest technology companies may soon explore stablecoin integration. The so-called Magnificent 7, which includes Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, could use blockchain-based tokens for cross-border payments or microtransactions. He said this would reduce costs and increase efficiency. While he expects the crypto market to remain quiet for the next few months, Hoskinson sees a turning point later this year. He predicted a new wave of investor interest starting around August or September that could continue into 2026.

In the days leading up to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on April 10, crypto investors have moved a huge amount of Bitcoin over 22,000 BTC worth $1.82 billion into Binance. According to CryptoQuant’s Maarten Regterschot, this sharp increase hints at investors repositioning due to macro uncertainty, particularly surrounding Donald Trump’s tariff policy and the inflation outlook. Why Are People Moving Their BTC to Binance? This spike in inflows often triggers alarm bells, as traders typically move crypto onto exchanges when they’re preparing to sell. With Bitcoin recently bouncing up 8.8% to around $82,474 after Trump’s 90-day pause on new tariffs (excluding China), some fear the market could be heading for a pullback. On the flip side, Swyftx analyst Pav Hundal notes this might not be bearish at all. He says the movement could simply reflect Binance preparing for higher trading volume rather than an incoming sell-off. Trump’s Tariff Pause Eases Pressure—For Now On April 9, Trump temporarily eased tensions by pausing his “reciprocal tariffs” policy, keeping tariffs at 10% for most countries but bumping China’s rate to 125%. While the move provided short-term relief and boosted Bitcoin’s price , the unresolved trade dispute between the U.S. and China still casts a long shadow over the market. Hundal warns that lingering geopolitical stress could continue to unsettle risk assets like crypto. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ​SEC Approves Options Trading for Spot Ethereum ETFs: A Game-Changer for Crypto Investors​ , All Eyes on CPI Data Market sentiment now hinges on inflation numbers. Some analysts, like Matthew Hyland, believe the March CPI could show a dramatic drop, possibly near 2.5%, which might fuel a Bitcoin rally. Another analyst, Dyme, expects BTC to rise if the CPI comes in lower than forecast. However, FactSet data suggests a more modest view, with economists predicting just a 0.1% monthly increase. As Bitcoin pours into Binance, the crypto market is at a critical juncture. Whether this is a sign of incoming profit-taking or a bullish reshuffle ahead of CPI data remains to be seen. One thing’s for sure: macro moves are once again setting the tone for Bitcoin’s next chapter. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These 3 Altcoins Could Make You Millions in 100 Days,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/time-to-enter-the-market-these-3-altcoins-could-make-you-millions-in-100-days-2/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano are among the most popular altcoins in the markets right now and they are back to gaining the value they lost in the market crash of Monday. Black Monday, as it’s being called, saw crypto as well as other markets crash badly on rising concerns about geopolitical situations, the escalating tariff war, and fears of a recession. However, while these concerns are valid, crypto saw billions of dollars in the form of longs and shorts being liquidated. The values of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano dropped significantly, along with most other cryptos. Smart investors are moving in now to pick up their choice of altcoins for future growth at their current dips to book good bargains. Many investors are picking up IntelMarkets along with Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to build a strong growth portfolio for the next quarter. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Recovering As Bargain Buyers Boost Demand In the aftermath of Monday’s crash, the crypto market is getting substantial support from whales and bargain hunters as they help boost the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost over 17% in value between April 6 and 7 as it dropped from $0.000012 to $0.000010. However, the recovery started on late Monday as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) regained about 9% value as it touched $0.000011. Current trading in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) charts is creating a rising trend as the price gained and then lost approximately 5% value. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.000011 as community sentiment remains bullish, and bulls remain in control of the narrative. Cardano Regains 10% Value As Markets Recover The Cardano price chart shows a recovery trend over the past 24 hours. Cardano dropped approximately 18%, from $0.61 to $0.51, before recovery set in, and the price peaked at $0.60. The current price of Cardano is $0.59, and the overall rise over the past 24 hours is around 10%. The community sentiment is bullish, and many investors are taking it as an opportunity to buy the dip and pick up Cardano at this low price. Eventually, once the markets establish some normalcy, Cardano’s price is expected to cross over the $0.75 range at the least. IntelMarkets: AI-Powered High Trading ROIs While established coins like Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are gaining momentum from investors looking to pick up bargains while the market is low, the IntelMarkets presale is gaining momentum from investors attracted by its 400% gain potential at launch. The official listing will probably be by early Q3 and the INTL token is expected to list at $0.42. This will mean that current investors who buy INTL tokens at $0.09 in stage 10 will book 400% gains. This is an attractive ROI for any investment category. Combine this with IntelMarkets’ (INTL) strong utility proposition, which will increase its usage and adoption, and INTL investors have a strong upside proposition. As a trading platform that uses AI technology to offer users an easy-to-use, high-performing trading platform with features that ensure that any trade booked will be profitable, IntelMarkets offers users AI-powered trading bots and market analysis tools that yield clear and specific trading signals to ensure high-performing trades. Key Takeaway While Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are due to deliver high returns in the next 100 days as they perform well in rising markets, IntelMarkets is also due to deliver over 400% gains once it lists. This makes it a great pick to invest in, along with the Cardano and Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens in their current market lows.

These are not the only two nations trying to de-dollarize during Donald Trump’s trade war . Bolivia has announced plans to import electricity using crypto, and French energy utility EDF is exploring whether it can mine Bitcoin with surplus electricity, he added . “These are early signs that Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset into a functional monetary tool,” he said before adding, “particularly in economies looking to bypass the dollar and reduce exposure to US-led financial systems.” BREAKING: VanEck confirms that China and Russia are officially settling some energy trades in Bitcoin as the trade war ramps up.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan echoed the sentiment in an April 9 blog post . The Trump administration “wants a weaker dollar, even if it means ending its role as the world’s reserve currency,” he said before pointing out that dollar weakness historically correlates with Bitcoin strength. He added that the world may move away from a single reserve currency such as the dollar to a “more fractured reserve system, with hard money like Bitcoin and gold playing a bigger role than it does today.” Other analysts are also of the opinion that a weakening greenback is good for crypto. $DXY [1W] continues to fall steeply and is not far away from breaking down from this triangular bearish continuation pattern.

This time, the asset-backed stablecoin fell under $0.90, with a low around $0.83. The sUSD stablecoin issued by Synthetix has fallen below $0.90, with a low around $0.83. This is the second de-pegging event for sUSD in the past month. The stablecoin is issued on a relatively small scale, with only 30.3M in circulating supply. The sUSD stablecoin may face more de-pegging events due to a shift in its collateral and minting rules. | Source: Coingecko For sUSD, this is the second de-peg since the end of March, for a total of three de-pegs in the past month. The asset has a five-year history with much deeper crises and lows of $0.40, lining up among the riskier stablecoins. The price levels of sUSD remained relatively flat during the 2023 bear market, but de-pegs resumed after market volatility increased. The current event arrives after Synthetix doubled the supply of sUSD in one month, by encouraging SNX token staking. The current supply of sUSD stablecoins is around 10% of the levels from 2021, when the supply peaked above 294M tokens. Synthetix tried to revive sUSD after the supply fell to a recent low of only 15M tokens. At that time, the stablecoin sank to lows of $0.92-$0.91 and Synthetix had to intervene and explain the de-peg. According to the stablecoin issuer, sUSD is still in a transitionary period, where de-pegs may be expected, and the protocol will work toward stabilizing the asset again. Synthetix aims to rebuild assets The current expansion of sUSD is tied to the Synthetix 420 Pool, where former SNX stakers can deposit more tokens and receive passive income. Previously, Synthetix worked as a DeFi protocol, where traders had to manually control their debt, often leading to liquidations. Previously, individual wallets could mint sUSD with a collateral ratio of 750% for SNX deposits, meaning each $7.50 in SNX minted one sUSD. Currently, the 420 pool mints sUSD based on all the deposited tokens, with the intention of bringing the collateral ratio down to 200%. In the coming year, there will be no quick mechanism to buy sUSD at pennies for the dollar, hence the risk of additional de-pegs. The effect of sUSD may be limited, as the token mostly uses other DEXs to trade against USDT and USDC. However, the new minting model tests the approach of Synthetix to generate and retain a reliable stablecoin. Every SNX owner that deposits into the 420 pool will have their debt forgiven over a 12-month period. Early exits will incur a penalty, so the current de-peg will not lead to an outflow of SNX staking. Users who stake SNX in the new pool will have to wait for a predetermined period to have their previous debt waivered. In the meantime, the deposited SNX is used to mint sUSD, with a 500% over-collateralization ratio. Currently, Synthetix has only regained $74M in value locked, down from over $2B during the 2021 bull market. The expanded supply of sUSD in the past month arrives during a golden age for stablecoin issuance and usage. However, smaller projects relying on crypto collaterals remain riskier. After the news of the de-peg, SNX traded at $0.63, near a three-month low. The Synthetix project sits outside the narrative of RWA protocols, and operates as a collateralized stablecoin issuer offering passive income. Synthetix remains one of the most active issuers for tokenized RWA, though its token lags behind ONDO and OM, which are now taking the bulk of mindshare and trading. The project also has support from the Synthetix DAO, with over $32M in its treasury. The DAO carries a diverse portfolio with 1M USDC, $731K in SNX tokens, and the remainder in various stablecoins and even meme tokens like PEPE. Synthetix is one of the oldest DeFi protocols, having survived multiple market cycles since 2018. For sUSD, the risk may be short-lived, but the protocol users may have stressful days ahead, combined with the general crypto market volatility.

SEC Lawsuit Update Coming on April 16?,https://cryptopotato.com/important-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-update-coming-on-april-16/,"TL;DR The XRP army is awaiting developments on April 16, when Ripple’s appellate brief is due. Legal expert Fred Rispoli suggests there’s a 90% chance of a settlement or withdrawal notice. The Official End is Near? The Ripple community celebrated the supposed end of the lengthy lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month when CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the agency had dropped its appeal against the company. However, the regulator has remained silent on the matter, raising the question of whether the case has truly reached its conclusion. The US attorney Fred Rispoli expects to see something happening on that front on April 16 or before. The date marks Ripple’s scheduled appellate brief. The legal expert believes there is a minor 10% possibility that the firm files the document, while the chance of a notice of settlement/withdrawal is set at 90%. Rispoli also claimed that Ripple made the announcement about the dropped appeal without written assurances from the SEC. “Nothing official has been done yet to effectuate the public announcement,” he added. The Latest Confrontation A filing from Justin W. Keener became the recent bone of contention between Ripple and the SEC. The court document was submitted at the start of April and represents “an emergency request” to Judge Analisa Torres to “present decisive evidence in favor of the defendants and in favor of liberty for the American people.” It remains unclear how the information aids Ripple, but it hints at ties to investment contracts Keener has collected. Meanwhile, the agency recently sued him for acting as an unregistered penny stock dealer, leading to a $10 million penalty. Earlier this week, the Commission opposed the “emergency request” for three important reasons. It claimed that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the filing since the case had already been transferred to the Second Circuit and argued that Keener failed to file the correct motion to intervene. Furthermore, the SEC labeled the request “unnecessary,” asserting that Ripple is capable of deciding for itself whether the evidence could benefit its case. The post Important Ripple v.

Trump Halt Tariffs for 90-day, China Saw 125% Hike On April 9, Trump made a strong statement on Truth Social , saying China has shown “a lack of respect for world markets.” In response, we’ve raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, effective immediately. At the same post, he mentioned that more than 75 countries have been in talks with U.S. representatives from Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR about ongoing trade issues. Meanwhile, to encourage negotiations, Trump announced a temporary 90-day pause on tariffs for other countries and reduced reciprocal tariffs to 10% during this period.

At the same time, 24-hour trading volume has jumped nearly 487% to over $2.1 million, as per CoinGecko data . This reflects growing market activity as concerns rise. Synthetix ( SNX ) is a decentralized finance protocol that lets users create and trade synthetic assets, which track the value of real-world assets on-chain. With the help of oracle data, its stablecoin, sUSD, is designed to mirror the price of the US dollar and is backed by the platform’s native token, SNX. The recent drop in sUSD’s price comes after the launch of SIP-420, a new proposal that introduced the “420 Pool.” This pool allows SNX holders to mint more sUSD with less collateral, lowering the limit to 200% instead of the previous 500%. Analysts claim that the main reason the stablecoin is falling from its peg is because of the sharp rise in the supply of sUSD, brought about by the lowered collateral requirement.

Although sUSD is still overcollateralized, its peg now depends more on market dynamics than direct arbitrage or traditional debt repayment methods. https://twitter.com/panterafii/status/1907187314239135964?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Synthetix developers have described this as a “transitionary period.” In its Discord , the team said it plans to boost incentives for liquidity pools and expand utility for sUSD through initiatives like Snaxchain. “During this transition there is excess sUSD in the market causing pressure on the price of sUSD (which is still healthily over-collateralised). We will continue to work on managing (increasing in the short term) incentives for curve pools, supporting the Infinex deposit campaign (will extend) and creating additional sinks for sUSD that will provide long term price support (snaxchain coming)” — Synthetix’s Discord statement This isn’t the first time sUSD has slipped below its peg. Core contributors reassured users of continued efforts to restore stability following similar incidents in March and May of 2024. While some believe that the problem is manageable others, like DeFi analyst Eldar, caution that the current model might not be able to sustain the peg in the long run without a clearer material value backing SNX. However, Kain Warwick, the founder of Synthetix , is still hopeful. He recently added more SNX to his holdings and stated that the current depeg is a short-term mechanism in SIP-420 implementation.

Analysts were quick to warn that the move could only provide temporary relief. “While the tariff suspension is good news, it is only for 90 days. This trade war is far from over. The uncertainty could make decision-making difficult for businesses that have been planning months in advance,” said Chris Stadele, a corporate analyst. Stadele also pointed to low trading volumes on Emini S&P 500 futures on CME ahead of the announcement, suggesting investors were hesitant to commit in either direction: “We don’t know yet whether the recovery in the markets is a short squeeze or a real risk appetite.” Related News: BREAKING: SEC Approves Options on Ethereum Spot ETFs! Major Development FX Managing Director Amarjit Sahota echoed similar concerns: “Markets may have responded positively in the short term, but this 90-day delay brings more uncertainty. This looks like a hasty political maneuver rather than a sound economic strategy.” Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers, called the decision a “surprise,” especially given the previous firm stance by U.S. officials declaring the tariffs non-negotiable: “The uncertainty has diminished but not gone away. Companies are now wondering if the tariffs will come back after 90 days.” Economist Nouriel Roubini, often referred to as “Dr. Doom” for correctly predicting the 2008 financial crisis, warned that the Fed was unlikely to act as a buffer for Trump’s tariff maneuvers. “There is a reckoning between Trump’s bottom and Powell’s bottom,” Roubini said, referring to political and monetary thresholds for taking action. “But Powell will wait for Trump to blink first.” Roubini believes the Fed will likely keep interest rates steady, contrary to growing market expectations of multiple rate cuts. *This is not investment advice.

According to the official filing from New York State Assembly member Clyde Vanel, Assembly Bill AA7716 aims to study how the blockchain can be used to protect voter personal records as well as safeguard the election results. At press time, the bill is currently being reviewed by the Assembly Election Law Committee, awaiting a legislative vote. Once it advances, it would have to pass through to the Assembly and State level before it is reviewed by the state governor for approval. According to the bill, the New York Board of Elections should conduct a formal study that evaluates how blockchain technology can be utilized to improve U.S. elections, particularly to protect voter records and ensure transparency with regards to election results. The bill mandates the New York State Board of Elections to collaborate with the Office of Information Technology Services, and request assistance from experts knowledgeable in blockchain technology, cybersecurity, voter fraud and election systems. You might also like: U.S. Congressman to introduce a bill ensuring the strategic Bitcoin reserve cannot be revoked If the bill does get enacted, New York’s Board of Elections would have to present the results of the study no later than one year after the bill is formalized. The Board’s findings must include examples of how other states have implemented similar technological solutions in their elections. A long-time advocate for crypto and blockchains, Vanel recently teamed up with Maryland delegate Adrian Boafo to push for Democratic lawmakers to establish a federal cryptocurrency regulatory framework. He also filed for a similar bill back in 2017, but it did not pass through. The use of blockchain technology to safeguard elections is not a new concept. In March 2024, permissionless zero-knowledge registry Rarimo launched a digital identity protocol called the Freedom Tool, which was designed to revolutionize electoral systems through the blockchain. Unlike traditional voting mechanisms, the Freedom Tool uses blockchain technology and identity management in order to make each vote anonymous and verifiable. In October 2024, Rarimo’s Freedom Tool was implemented into a government electoral system when Georgian opposition party, the United National Movement, launched United Space — an identity app powered by Rarimo — ahead of its parliamentary elections. The app’s blockchain-based technology provided voters with a system that was free of privacy violation concerns and potential voter manipulation. It also ensured citizens had a level of anonymity that traditional election systems could not.

This has seen the cryptocurrency lose almost 50% of its acquired value between late 2024 and early 2025. Nevertheless, this has failed to erode bullish sentiment, with predictions for higher prices dominating the community. Time To Go Long On The XRP Price? A crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) has renewed bullish hope after identifying an important formation on the XRP price chart. The analysis pointed out that the XRP Price is still moving within a descending channel, a formation that usually signals a bearish move. Related Reading: Major Ethereum Whale Dumps 10,000 ETH After 2 Years, Is It Time To Get Out? However, the downtrend has pushed the altcoin’s price to the point where it is now testing the bottom trend line. This bottom trend line has been known to act as strong support previously and is expected to do so this time around. With the support forming, it is likely that the XRP Price is gearing up for a bounce from this level. Furthermore, the crypto analyst points out that XRP is also forming a rounded bottom inside this descending channel. Such a rounded bottom could signal an end to the downtrend from here. As the formation grows, the main level of support is now sitting at $1.6. So far, this level has held up quite nicely and bulls have been using it as a bounce-off point for recovery. Given this, the crypto analyst advises that entries for the XRP price are best at around $1.70 to $1.85. This is not the only good news for the XRP price with support forming. If it holds and the altcoin does indeed bounce from this level toward $2, then the next important levels lie between $2 and $2.2. These serve as the levels for the bulls to beat to confirm a bullish continuation toward a possible all-time high. If the bulls are successful, then three profit targets are placed by the crypto analyst. These include $2.3385, $2.8160, and $3.3062, pushing it toward January 2025 highs. Related Reading: Uncertainty Rocks Market As ETH/BTC Drops To 6-Year Low, Where Is Bitcoin Headed Next? The Bearish Case While the analysis is inherently bullish, there is still the possibility of invalidation that could send the XRP price tumbling further. As the analyst points out, the major support currently lies at $1.6. This means that bulls must hold this level. Otherwise, there is the risk of a much deeper correction as a liquidity sweep could send support further down to $1.3. Nevertheless, with buy sentiments building once again, it is likely that XRP will follow the bullish scenario in this case.

Total bitcoin spot trading volume on crypto exchanges declined from a high of $44 billion on February 3 to $10 billion at the end of Q1, a nearly 77% drop, according to the analytics firm. Meanwhile, total altcoin spot trading volume on crypto exchanges declined from a high of $122 billion on February 3 to $23 billion at the end of Q1 — a more than 80% fall. A volume drop of such magnitude suggests traders and investors are losing interest or confidence, possibly due to uncertainty or fear. Falling prices mean the value of bitcoin and other cryptos is going down, which can scare off more people, creating a cycle of less trading and lower prices, the report added. Market's loss is Binance's gain During the same time, Binance increased its dominance over the other crypto exchanges with its share of total market trading reaching almost 50%. Binance's share of total daily bitcoin spot trading volume increased from 33% on February 3 to 49% by the end of Q1. This implies that trading volumes on other exchanges declined much faster than on Binance, and that the exchange becomes the largest liquidity venue during times of higher market volatility. Furthermore, Binance's share of total daily altcoin spot trading volume increased from 38% on February 3 to 44% by the end of Q1. Some altcoins still show relatively high spot trading volumes on Binance, in spite of the overall slowdown in trading volumes. For example, large altcoins like BNB, TON and EOS are still being traded with relatively high activity, at a time that overall crypto volumes have declined. Meanwhile, bitcoin inflows to Binance have accelerated in the past week, CryptoQuant independent analyst Martuun wrote. “The bitcoin reserve on Binance has increased from 568,768 BTC (Mar 28) to 590,874 BTC (Apr 9), an increase of 22,106 BTC,” he said in a snippet . “This shows a strong acceleration in BTC inflows to Binance. It’s likely that investors are actively moving funds to Binance, due the macro uncertainty and before the upcoming CPI announcement.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Binance,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 08:05:05

Recently, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale had moved 1,030,000 SOL, worth $110.29 million, from the Kraken exchange. 1,030,000 #SOL (110,291,760 USD) transferred from #Kraken to unknown wallet https://t.co/3X5bwrX41C — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 9, 2025 However, the wallet address of the whale remains unknown. Why is Solana (SOL) Price Rising? This substantial SOL transfer occurred while the cryptocurrency market was experiencing downside momentum ahead of Donald Trump’s 90-day tariff pause announcement. The timing has raised concerns of potential insider information, as SOL—along with other assets—skyrocketed following the transaction. At press time, SOL is trading near $119 and has recorded a price surge of over 13.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 35%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Following the surge in SOL’s price, the asset has reached a key resistance level, which has been formed by a descending trendline since early February 2025. According to expert technical analysis, SOL is on the verge of breaking out of a bullish falling wedge price action pattern. Based on recent price action, if the current market sentiment remains unchanged, there is a strong possibility it could breach this pattern and rally significantly. According to the daily chart, if SOL closes a daily candle above $125, the asset could potentially soar by 40% to reach the $180 level. Source: Trading View At present, SOL is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both the four-hour and daily timeframes, which still indicates that the asset is in a downtrend. Traders Key Levels Despite the current market sentiment and the price forming a bullish pattern, traders are seen betting on the bearish side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass.

Binance’s Vote to Delist program is part of its ongoing effort to improve transparency and give the community a voice in listing decisions. According to the platform’s Apr. 10 announcement , the tokens up for potential delisting are FTT, JASMY, VOXEL, GPS, ZEC, STPT, ARK, ARDR, MBL, PERP, NKN, WING, LTO, FLM, BSW, ALPACA, and PDA. Voting will take place through Binance Square between Apr. 10 at 4:00 UTC and Apr. 16 at 23:59 UTC. Users must have a verified Binance account and hold at least 0.01 BNB during the voting period in order to be eligible. Each user can vote for up to five tokens, with one vote per project. While Binance will consider community feedback, it clarified that the outcome of the vote won’t be the only deciding factor. Other elements such as project activity, liquidity, team responsiveness, and regulatory risks will influence the final delisting decision.

Binance cited concerns about compliance, slow development, and poor trading activity as some of the reasons for their delisting. In another recent development, on Apr. 9, Binance introduced LDUSDT, a new reward-bearing margin asset designed to boost capital efficiency. With LDUSDT, users can convert Tether ( USDT ) from Simple Earn, Binance’s savings product, into a margin asset for futures trading while still earning real-time APR rewards. This feature gives users more flexibility by enabling them to use the same capital in two different ways.

For those deeply invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding the implications of this appointment is now more crucial than ever. What changes can we expect under Atkins’ leadership, and how will these changes impact the future of crypto innovation and investment? Who is Paul Atkins, the New SEC Chair? Before we delve into the potential impacts on crypto regulation , it’s important to understand who Paul Atkins is and what he brings to the table as the new SEC Chair . Atkins is not a newcomer to the Securities and Exchange Commission . He previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, nominated by President George W. Bush. During his tenure, he was known for his expertise in financial markets and his focus on regulatory efficiency and investor protection. His background includes: Extensive Experience: Years of experience within the SEC itself, giving him an insider’s perspective on the agency’s operations and challenges. Market Acumen: Deep understanding of how financial markets operate, particularly in the context of traditional securities. Conservative Approach: Often associated with a more conservative and market-oriented approach to regulation, emphasizing principles of free markets and limited government intervention. This background suggests that Atkins’ leadership at the SEC could bring about significant changes in the regulatory landscape, especially concerning emerging sectors like cryptocurrency. What Does Atkins’ Appointment Mean for Crypto Regulation? The big question on everyone’s mind in the crypto space is: how will Paul Atkins’ appointment as SEC Chair affect crypto regulation ? While it’s still early days, we can analyze potential directions based on his past statements and regulatory philosophy. Here are some key areas to consider: 1. Potential for Stricter Enforcement Given his background in traditional financial markets and focus on investor protection, Atkins might bring a more stringent approach to enforcing existing securities laws within the crypto space. This could mean: Increased Scrutiny of ICOs and Token Sales: Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales have long been a gray area in regulation. Atkins’ SEC might take a harder stance on classifying many tokens as securities, leading to stricter registration and compliance requirements. Crackdown on Unregistered Exchanges and Platforms: Platforms facilitating the trading of digital assets may face increased pressure to register with the SEC and adhere to securities regulations. More Aggressive Action Against Fraud and Market Manipulation: The SEC under Atkins could be more proactive in investigating and prosecuting cases of fraud, insider trading, and market manipulation within the cryptocurrency market. 2. Clarity vs. Ambiguity in Regulatory Frameworks One of the persistent challenges in crypto regulation has been the lack of clear guidelines. Will Atkins’ SEC provide more clarity, or will ambiguity continue to prevail? Potential for Clarity: Some experts believe that a leader with Atkins’ experience could bring a more structured and defined approach to regulation. This could involve issuing clearer guidelines on when digital assets are considered securities, providing a more predictable environment for businesses operating in the crypto space. Risk of Over-Regulation: Conversely, a stricter regulatory stance could also stifle innovation. If the SEC adopts overly broad definitions of securities or imposes burdensome compliance requirements, it could drive crypto innovation overseas or hinder the growth of the industry in the U.S. 3. Focus on Investor Protection Investor protection is a cornerstone of the SEC’s mission, and Atkins is expected to prioritize this. In the context of crypto regulation , this could translate to: Enhanced Disclosure Requirements: Companies involved in crypto may face stricter requirements to disclose risks, financial information, and project details to investors. Emphasis on Due Diligence: Investors might be encouraged to exercise greater due diligence and be wary of high-risk crypto investments. Educational Initiatives: The SEC could ramp up investor education efforts to make the public more aware of the risks and complexities of investing in cryptocurrencies. The Impact on Different Crypto Sectors The new SEC Chair ‘s approach to crypto regulation will likely have varying impacts across different sectors within the crypto ecosystem: Crypto Sector Potential Impact Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Increased scrutiny due to its complex and often opaque nature. DeFi protocols may face pressure to comply with securities laws if deemed applicable. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) Uncertain impact. NFTs that are primarily collectibles may face less regulatory pressure than those that are marketed as investment vehicles. Cryptocurrency Exchanges Likely to face stricter oversight and potential requirements for registration and compliance, especially if they list tokens considered securities. Stablecoins Continued regulatory focus. Stablecoins, especially those not backed by reserves, may face increased scrutiny and potential regulatory action. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Navigating the evolving landscape of crypto regulation under Paul Atkins will present both challenges and opportunities for the crypto industry: Challenges: Compliance Costs: Stricter regulations could mean higher compliance costs for crypto businesses, potentially hindering smaller startups and projects. Regulatory Uncertainty: While clarity is hoped for, there’s also a risk that the regulatory environment could become even more complex and uncertain in the short term as new rules are developed and implemented. Potential for Enforcement Actions: Companies operating in gray areas could face increased risk of enforcement actions from the SEC. Opportunities: Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Clear and sensible regulations can provide legitimacy to the crypto industry, potentially attracting more institutional investors and fostering mainstream adoption. Innovation within Regulatory Frameworks: A well-defined regulatory framework can encourage innovation within established boundaries, leading to more sustainable and compliant crypto projects. Investor Confidence: Stronger investor protection measures can boost confidence in the crypto market, attracting a broader range of investors. Actionable Insights for Crypto Stakeholders Given these potential shifts in crypto regulation , what should crypto businesses, investors, and enthusiasts do? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on SEC announcements, guidance, and enforcement actions under Atkins’ leadership. Seek Legal Counsel: Crypto businesses should consult with legal experts to ensure compliance with existing and evolving regulations. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in industry discussions and engage with regulators to provide feedback and contribute to the development of sensible regulations. Prioritize Compliance: Even in the absence of perfect clarity, prioritize compliance with existing securities laws and best practices. Conclusion: Navigating the New Regulatory Era The confirmation of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair marks a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. His deep experience in financial markets and focus on investor protection suggest a potentially more assertive approach to crypto regulation . While this may present challenges in terms of compliance and potential enforcement, it also offers opportunities for greater legitimacy, mainstream adoption, and investor confidence in the long run. The coming months and years will be crucial in shaping the regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S., and stakeholders must remain vigilant, informed, and proactive to navigate this new era successfully.

The altcoins are also well in the green, with XRP leading the charge from the larger caps. BTC Skyrockets It has been a wild ride in the crypto industry lately, prompted by Trump’s continuous moves on the macro scene. It all began last Wednesday during the so-called ‘Liberation Day’ when he imposed a 10% tax essentially on the entire world, while countries like these in the EU and China got even bigger percentages. While some retaliated, Trump became even more aggressive and increased the Chinese tariffs to 104% and then 125% yesterday. At the same time, he paused for 90 days the taxes against all other countries. All of this news brought massive volatility to crypto. Just from this Monday, BTC’s price had dropped to and below $75,000 on a couple of occasions, with the latest example coming yesterday. However, the aforementioned pause served as a propeller for immediate gains and bitcoin skyrocketed by almost nine grand from bottom to the top. It tapped $83,500 earlier but couldn’t continue north. As of now, it remains above $81,000 after a small correction. Its market cap has soared to $1.620 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is well above 60%. BTCUSD.

Position limit set at 25,000 contracts reduces market manipulation risk for Ethereum. Ethereum price jumps 13% in 24 hours fueled by positive market news. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs—a move similar to what it previously did for Bitcoin spot ETFs. What Does ETH ETF Options Approval Mean? This approval allows financial institutions to create and list options contracts tied to spot Ethereum ETFs, giving investors more ways to hedge their positions or speculate on Ethereum’s price movements within a regulated U.S. framework. One of the key updates in the approved filing is a position and exercise limit set at 25,000 contracts per investor, on exchanges like Nasdaq ISE. This relatively conservative limit is to balance market stability concerns with investor access, reducing manipulation risk while still allowing significant trading.

Only Time Will Tell,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/10/new-rull-run-or-bear-market-rally-only-time-will-tell,"Don't be fooled by Wednesday's market turnaround, which saw the S&P 500 equities benchmark climbing by the most since 2008 and significant gains in bitcoin ( BTC ) and the broader crypto market, as represented by the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index. The rally, sparked by President Donald Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs, fueled social-media optimism of an imminent prolonged bull run in both stocks and crypto. That may be overoptimistic, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs and elsewhere, who note that multiweek, double-digit equity price rallies are quite common even during larger bear markets. “In most bear markets, given light positioning, marginal changes in these variables can have amplified effects on markets. As a result, bear market rallies are quite common,” Goldman’s strategy team led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a Tuesday note titled “Bear Market Anatomy – the path and shape of the bear market. There have been 19 global bear market rallies since the 1980s and on an average, “they have lasted 44 days and the MSCI AC World return is 10% to 15%,” the note said. “One of the worst bear markets of history saw about half a dozen major double-digit rallies before all was said and done,” Callum Thomas, founder and head of research at Topdown Charts, said on X referring to the 1930s. “Is the 90-day bounce a BMR?” Whether the recent bounce signifies the onset of a new bull run or merely a bear market rally won't become clear until later. However, certain characteristics of a sustained bottom mentioned by Goldman such as attractive valuations, extreme negative positioning, policy intervention and a slowdown in macroeconomic deterioration, are not yet evident. The Federal Reserve is unlikely to offer support any time soon, while Trump has only halted tariffs for 90 days, meaning trade tensions could escalate again. Plus, tariffs on China continue to rise and if that’s not enough, stocks are not cheap yet .",Markets|Markets|Equities|Bear markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 09:16:18

The asset has faced persistent instability since the start of 2025. On Jan. 1, sUSD dropped to $0.96 and only rebounded to $0.99 in early February. Prices continued to fluctuate through February before stabilizing in March. On April 10, sUSD fell to a five-year low of $0.83, according to data from CoinGecko. SUSD is a crypto-collateralized stablecoin. Users lock up SNX tokens to mint sUSD, making its stability highly dependent on the market value of SNX. 1-month price chart of Synthetix USD stablecoin. Source: CoinGecko Synthetix USD’s “death spiral” risks When the sUSD token dropped to $0.91 on April 1, Rob Schmitt, the co-founder of the risk tokenization platform Cork Protocol, explained the potential “death spiral scenario” of the stablecoin. Schmitt said the stablecoin’s design shares similarities with Terra’s TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin, which collapsed in 2022. While he noted key differences in collateralization and debt management, Schmitt said the fundamental risk remains: “The death spiral scenario remains the same though, if the value of SNX drops sufficiently, sUSD is no longer fully backed. If fear of sUSD being unbacked triggers users to redeem sUSD for SNX and sell this, it creates further downwards pressure on SNX, creating a cascading deleveraging event.” Despite the concern, Schmitt emphasized that such a collapse is unlikely due to Synthetix’s $30 million treasury, which holds about half of the outstanding sUSD debt. He said this reserve could be deployed against a spiral scenario. “The biggest factor why sUSD won’t death spiral is because the Synthetix treasury hodls about $30 million of sUSD, which is about half the outstanding debt. To avoid a death spiral, this sUSD can be unwound,” Schmitt wrote. Synthetix founder Kain Warwick previously responded to the dips, saying that while he had feared a death spiral during the last seven years, he sleeps “great” these days. He explained that the dips happened because the primary driver of sUSD buying had been removed. “New mechanisms are being introduced but in this transition there will be some volatility,” Warwick wrote. The Synthetix founder added that since sUSD is a pure crypto collateralized stablecoin, the peg can drift. However, the executive said there are mechanisms to push it back in line if it goes above or below its peg. “These mechanisms are being transitioned right now, hence the drift,” Warwick added . Cointelegraph approached Warwick for further comment but had not heard back by publication.

On April 7, Synnax Stablecoin (syUSD) dropped to $0.94. The project said concentrated sell activities temporarily caused a “slight deviation” from its dollar peg. The project said it was working on implementing a fully open redemption system.

In a letter sent to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, OpenSea’s legal department, led by the general counsel, Adele Faure, and Laura Brookover, the deputy general counsel of OpenSea, argued that NFT platforms operate differently from traditional exchanges. Their arguments were that NFT marketplaces do not transact, mediate, or provide platforms in which multiple buyers and sellers trade P2P and identical products, which are key exchange features. The legal team also shared that numerous enforcement actions made by the SEC made the crypto market rather uncertain. OpenSea cited the need for clarity to safeguard American tech firms and encourage the growth of innovation in the NFT space. They also asked the Crypto Task Force at the SEC to provide informal advice on the legal status of NFT marketplaces, as per the agency’s recent clarifications on memecoins and stablecoins. “In preparing this guidance, the Crypto Task Force should specifically address the application of exchange regulations to marketplaces for non-fungible assets, similar to the recent staff statements on memecoins and stablecoins.” ~ OpenSea. OpenSea challenges Broker registration requirements In addition to the exchange classification issue, OpenSea has rejected any SEC classification that considers NFT marketplaces as brokers. According to Faure and Brookover, OpenSea and similar NFT marketplaces do not qualify for the broker definition because they do not provide advice, trade, and hold their customers’ funds. They urged the SEC to clarify remaining uncertainty in the industry by providing guidance that states that NFT marketplaces cannot be classified as brokers under federal securities laws. OpenSea also suggested to the Commission that any NFT marketplace should be excluded from any future broker’s regulation. This stance comes at a time when the SEC has articulated positions on other crypto instruments. In the past few months, the SEC has clarified that some stablecoins and memecoins are not securities. The stablecoins that meet certain characteristics are exempt from transaction reporting rules, while the memecoins are classified as collectibles and not securities. The SEC has also dismissed some enforcement actions on various crypto companies. SEC ends probe into OpenSea OpenSea’s request for such clarity came after a positive occurrence in the NFT market. The SEC recently concluded an investigation into OpenSea without either taking the platform to court or categorizing NFTs as securities. This new development is a complete departure from the past, where the agency focused more on enforcement. Devin Finzer, OpenSea CEO, also applauded the decision, calling it a win for not just OpenSea but Web3 and NFT users as a whole. Finzer claimed that defining NFTs as securities would have been detrimental and placed many limitations on their development. “Trying to classify NFTs as securities would have been a step backward. Every creator should be able to build freely without unnecessary barriers.” ~ Devin Finzer. NFT trading has lately experienced a drastic decline in its activity. In 2024, NFT trading volumes and sales count were among the lowest recorded since 2020. According to data, the annual trading volume has reduced by about 19%, and sales are 18% lower than what was recorded a year ago. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

These digital innovations have more in common than you might think. Despite their seemingly different uses, one as a financial infrastructure and the other as competitive entertainment, the overlap of technologies has been documented, as both sectors embrace similar technological foundations and user engagement models. The gaming sector has been quick to appreciate the synergies between these two worlds. Online and offline casinos alike have borrowed more from both, with numerous operators now accepting cryptocurrency payments alongside traditional fiat currencies while continuing to develop their products beyond games of chance. Gamers wanting an instant casino experience online are increasingly being offered options that merge traditional gambling with skill-based content, resulting in hybrid forms of entertainment that defy easy classification. These websites use blockchain technology to not just make payments but also ensure the validity of competitive play, responding to longstanding questions regarding the integrity of online gambling websites. The parallels between cryptocurrency and skill gaming go further than the surface-level adoption of technology. Both sectors reward strategy and expertise, providing space where committed players can hone skill sets that yield a competitive edge. Cryptocurrency traders examine market trends, technical graphs, and underlying development to inform their choices, just as talented poker players use game theory, statistical reasoning, and trend identification to outmaneuver opponents. Such a focus on skill acquisition fosters dedicated communities here and there, with dedicated forums, study books, and professional analysts offering enthusiast bases. Risk management is another intriguing intersection of these two seemingly unrelated domains. Sophisticated risk-avoidance techniques such as portfolio diversification , position sizing, and market timing are used by skilled cryptocurrency traders – techniques surprisingly identical to bankroll management tactics used by master skill game players. Both processes involve the requirement to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty and psychological pressure, leading to rash decisions during chaotic times. While there are these similarities, there are inherent differences that separate skill games from cryptocurrencies. One of the most obvious of these is purpose. Cryptocurrencies are largely financial instruments with utility outside of entertainment, while skill games exist largely to provide competitive play and entertainment value. This distinction carries with it differing regulatory paradigms, with cryptocurrencies increasingly becoming regulated as financial products and skill gaming being governed by gambling and entertainment laws. Time horizons also vary widely across these markets. Cryptocurrency investments are based on longer time horizons with intermittent feedback cycles, whereas skill games give immediate performance feedback in the form of win/loss results or performance metrics. Temporal variations influence participant psychology and participation patterns, with skill gamers wanting frequent dopamine stimulation but cryptocurrency fans learning to tolerate longer rewards and delayed uncertainty. As these online worlds grow more sophisticated, their perimeters will increasingly blur, especially as gamification concepts seep into financial sites and monetary rewards become increasingly embedded in competitive games. This intersection suggests not only parallel growth but also the potential for significant influence between financial and entertainment systems—a shift worth watching closely in the coming years.

Data from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reveals that 1,501 ETH, valued at approximately $2.46 million, was moved from the Kraken exchange to this wallet just seven hours prior. What makes this transaction particularly interesting is the subsequent movement of these funds into prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols – Aave and Compound. Let’s delve deeper into this intriguing on-chain activity and explore its potential implications for the crypto market. Why is the Kraken co-founder ‘s wallet activity drawing attention? Transactions involving high-profile figures in the crypto industry, especially founders of major exchanges like Kraken, often pique the interest of the crypto community and market analysts alike. Jesse Powell, as a Kraken co-founder and still actively involved as chairman, holds significant influence and his financial decisions are closely watched. Any substantial movement of assets from a wallet linked to him can be interpreted as a signal, whether it’s a strategic portfolio adjustment or a broader market outlook. Therefore, the withdrawal of a significant amount of Ethereum from Kraken by a wallet reportedly linked to Powell naturally raises eyebrows and prompts further investigation into the motivations behind such a move. What exactly happened with the Ethereum withdrawal ? According to on-chain data provided by Lookonchain, the sequence of events unfolded as follows: Withdrawal from Kraken: A wallet, identified by Lookonchain as potentially linked to Jesse Powell, initiated an Ethereum withdrawal of 1,501 ETH from the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. Transfer to Wallet: The withdrawn ETH, valued at $2.46 million at the time of transaction, was transferred to the aforementioned wallet. Deposit into DeFi Platforms: Subsequently, the wallet deposited the ETH into two leading DeFi lending protocols: Aave and Compound. This series of transactions suggests a deliberate move to engage with the DeFi lending ecosystem, rather than simply transferring funds to cold storage or another centralized exchange. The choice of Aave and Compound, both established and reputable DeFi lending platforms, further indicates a strategic intent behind this Ethereum withdrawal . DeFi Lending : What are Aave and Compound and why are they relevant? DeFi lending platforms like Aave and Compound have revolutionized the way people interact with cryptocurrencies. They operate as decentralized, non-custodial protocols that allow users to lend and borrow crypto assets without intermediaries like traditional banks. Here’s a breakdown of their key features and relevance: Decentralization: Built on blockchain technology, these platforms operate autonomously through smart contracts, eliminating the need for central authorities. Non-Custodial: Users retain control of their assets at all times. When lending or borrowing, assets are managed by smart contracts, not a central entity. Yield Generation: Lenders can earn interest on their deposited crypto assets, providing a way to generate passive income in the crypto space. Borrowing Opportunities: Borrowers can access crypto loans by providing collateral, enabling them to leverage their assets or gain liquidity without selling their holdings. Transparency: All transactions and protocol operations are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and auditability. The popularity of DeFi lending stems from its potential to offer higher yields compared to traditional savings accounts, along with the accessibility and transparency inherent in blockchain technology. By depositing ETH into Aave and Compound, the wallet linked to Jesse Powell could be aiming to earn interest on these assets, potentially capitalizing on the yields offered within these DeFi lending protocols. Could this Crypto wallet activity signal broader market trends? While it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions based on a single wallet’s activity, transactions of this nature can sometimes offer insights into broader market trends or the sentiment of key players. Here are a few potential interpretations of this Crypto wallet movement: Bullish on DeFi: The decision to deposit a significant amount of ETH into DeFi lending platforms could indicate a bullish outlook on the DeFi sector. It suggests confidence in the continued growth and stability of these protocols and a belief in their potential to generate returns. Yield Farming Strategy: This move might be a straightforward yield farming strategy. With potential yields offered by Aave and Compound, depositing ETH could be a way to earn passive income on a substantial crypto holding. Portfolio Diversification: It’s also possible that this is part of a broader portfolio diversification strategy. Allocating assets to DeFi could be a way to diversify holdings beyond centralized exchanges and explore different investment opportunities within the crypto ecosystem. Personal Financial Decision: Ultimately, this could simply be a personal financial decision by Jesse Powell or someone associated with him. Without direct confirmation, any interpretation remains speculative. Jesse Powell and Kraken’s Continued Influence Even after stepping down as CEO of Kraken in 2022, Jesse Powell remains a highly influential figure in the cryptocurrency world in his role as chairman. Kraken, under his leadership and continued guidance, has grown into one of the largest and most respected cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Powell’s views and actions are often closely monitored by the crypto community, and any activity linked to him tends to generate significant interest. His early and strong advocacy for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has solidified his position as a thought leader in the space. Therefore, while this Ethereum withdrawal might be just one transaction among millions occurring daily on the blockchain, the reported link to Jesse Powell elevates its significance in the eyes of market participants. Actionable Insights and Key Takeaways While we cannot definitively know the exact motivations behind this Ethereum withdrawal and deposit into DeFi lending platforms, this event offers several key takeaways for crypto enthusiasts and investors: DeFi is Gaining Traction: The fact that a wallet reportedly linked to a prominent figure like Jesse Powell is interacting with DeFi lending platforms underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance and utilization of DeFi protocols. On-Chain Data is Valuable: This story highlights the importance of on-chain data analysis in uncovering potentially significant market movements and understanding the actions of key players. Platforms like Lookonchain provide valuable tools for tracking and interpreting blockchain transactions. Stay Informed, But Avoid Speculation: While it’s important to stay informed about market developments and on-chain activity, it’s equally crucial to avoid excessive speculation based on limited information. Unless there is direct confirmation from Jesse Powell or Kraken, any interpretation of this transaction remains speculative. Explore DeFi Lending (with Caution): For those interested in exploring opportunities within the crypto space, DeFi lending platforms like Aave and Compound offer avenues for yield generation and borrowing. However, it’s essential to conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved (including smart contract risks and impermanent loss), and exercise caution when engaging with DeFi protocols. Conclusion: Decoding Crypto Movements The Ethereum withdrawal from Kraken and subsequent deposit into DeFi lending protocols by a wallet reportedly linked to Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell serves as a fascinating case study in the world of cryptocurrency transactions. It underscores the transparency of blockchain technology and the insights that can be gleaned from on-chain data. While the precise reasons behind this move remain unconfirmed, it undoubtedly adds another layer of intrigue to the ever-evolving narrative of the crypto market and the strategic decisions of its key figures. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, monitoring such on-chain activities will likely become increasingly important for understanding market trends and identifying potential shifts in investment strategies.

Moreover, the whales have also tuned optimistic, which may have a positive impact on the rally. The crypto markets required a small bullish boost, which seems to have come in the form of tariff relaxations. Therefore, the BTC price and markets are expected to maintain a consolidated ascending trend unless new turbulence disrupts the trade dynamics. Ever since the trade war began, whales and institutions have halted the accumulation of BTC. Besides, the ETFs also recorded consecutive outflows, hinting towards the growing uncertainty among them. Now that the pressure over the global markets appears to have dropped, the whales have yet again begun to accumulate Bitcoin. This suggests a major price action is fast approaching. Source: X The whale’s accumulation of over $147 million worth of BTC points towards a major shift in the market dynamics. Whenever the whales accumulate heavily, the broader crypto market often undertakes a strong rise. The liquidation chart of Bitcoin validates bullish possibilities as the token could be heading towards a short squeeze. The Bitcoin price underwent a massive upswing and attracted more than 11% gains, which is huge for the star token. Currently, the price is consolidating around the gains, which raises the possibility of a short squeeze. This occurs when the short sellers who got liquidated due to the price rise are forced to buy back at the local highs to recover the positions. This is expected to trigger the prices up, yet again liquidating the shorts. However, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is required to surpass the crucial resistance at $86,900, which may set the stage for a new ATH, as suggested by the Mayer Multiple. Otherwise, levels slightly below $70,000 may offer a strong base.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-10 09:22:58

The prime reason behind this is its founder Michael Saylore’s Bitcoin buying strategy, which influenced its MSTR stock price. Although the token has witnessed a significant rally with this crypto connection, its performance depends on the digital asset. At present, the share price is rising while the major assets are crashing amid Trump’s tariff chaos. Why? Let’s discuss this. Why is MicroStrategy Share Price Up 25% Today? Donald Trump’s 90-day pause decision on reciprocal tariffs has brought some relief among investors as both the crypto market and crypto stock prices have significantly recovered. In this, Bitcoin has witnessed a significant uptrend, currently trading at $82.1k with a 7% surge in the last 24 hours. As the investors’ sentiments fueled the recovery, the MicroStrategy share price surged 25%. It showcases the direct connection between the two assets. With that, the MSTR stock is worth $296.86 today after gaining +58.91 points. This is interesting, as the MicroStrategy stock has been down significantly, and many anticipated a further downfall amid this Trump’s tariff chaos. However, the struggles are just beginning, and the market may continue to face volatility with growing US recession odds, tariff updates, and much more. MicroStrategy Share Price May Collapse as Saylor to Sell Bitcoin Holdings The surge in the Bitcoin price has resulted in the MSTR stock price surge. However, the recent fall has brought attention to a concerning point, which may require Michael Saylor to sell BTC holdings to repay debt. A recent CoinGape blog revealed that the Bitcoin price is closer to the average price at which MicroStrategy buys its BTC holdings. This is an anxious point as the firm has a $40 billion stash, which may be sold to avoid liquidation per Doctor Profit. Interestingly, Michael Saylor also anticipated the possibility, resulting in the submission of an 8-K form to the SEC. If the BTC price declines, the firm may sell its Bitcoin holdings to repay debts. Although this is standard risk management, there is the possibility that it could result in a decline in MicroStrategy share price. However, if the market recovers, analysts like Peter DiCarlo predicted the MSTR stock price to hit $700 by the end of June.

The image, which MetaMan X shared alongside the caption “Federal Reserve Transfer Mode – XRP in a 1992 Movie called ‘Sneakers’… (Screenshot)”, shows what appears to be a computer interface with options related to interbank systems and remote access functions. What particularly caught attention is line [2] on the screen, which reads: “International Telelink Access (Code Lin: XRP-262)”. “Federal Reserve Transfer Mode” XRP in a 1992 Movie called “Sneakers”… (Screenshot) pic.twitter.com/8hFGSTjfHN — 𝙈𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙈𝙖𝙣 𝙓 (@MetaMan_X) April 7, 2025 The screenshot is from a fictional interface labeled “Federal Reserve Transfer Node – National Headquarters,” presented within the movie’s plot as a secure communication and funds transfer system. The use of the term “XRP” in this context—decades before the cryptocurrency of the same name was developed—has prompted a wave of speculation within the digital asset community, especially among followers of XRP. MetaMan X is known for sharing content that often draws connections between media, finance, and technology. This post continues that trend, highlighting what some users believe could be a pre-cryptocurrency era coincidence or intentional foreshadowing. The tweet includes only the image and a short description, allowing followers to interpret the meaning on their own. A Closer Look at the Screenshot from Sneakers In the screenshot, the interface appears to offer several options tied to financial or secure communications systems, such as “Interbank Funds Transfer,” “Remote Facsimile Send/Receive,” and “Regional Bank Interconnect.” The second entry on the list is labeled “International Telelink Access,” and it is here that the code “XRP-262” appears. While this is likely a random alphanumeric designation typical of fictional terminals in movies, its resemblance to the name of a prominent cryptocurrency has not gone unnoticed. The film Sneakers, released in 1992, is centered on themes of surveillance, cryptography, and hacking. It stars Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, and Dan Aykroyd, and has been cited by some as ahead of its time in its depiction of digital espionage. The use of “ XRP ” in the scene may have no relationship to the blockchain-based digital asset that would emerge two decades later. However, the similarity in acronym has been enough to spark interest among observers. Community Reaction and Theories In the replies to MetaMan X’s post, users offered a mix of intrigue and skepticism. One user, Davidworley76, commented : “Yeah, it’s fun to theorize about the creation of XRP and it showing up in a movie about the same time. I just don’t see how it translates to the current administration.” His remarks reflect a broader perspective that, while the coincidence is interesting, it is likely unrelated to current financial or political systems. There is no evidence that this reference in Sneakers has any direct connection to the digital asset XRP, which was formally introduced in 2012 by Ripple Labs (originally OpenCoin) . The film’s release year suggests the “XRP” reference was incidental. Still, some viewers continue to explore the possibility of hidden references or predictive elements embedded in older films.

The Chinese Yuan , a major player in the global currency arena, has just hit a staggering 17-year low. Yes, you read that right – a level not seen since 2007. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies and digital finance, understanding these traditional market movements is crucial. So, what’s causing this dramatic shift, and what does it mean for you and the wider financial landscape? Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of this fascinating (and slightly alarming) situation. Why is the Chinese Yuan Facing Pressure? Understanding Currency Devaluation The primary culprit behind this currency devaluation is the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and its recent policy adjustments. In the face of escalating trade tensions with the US, the PBOC appears to be strategically loosening its grip on the Yuan. But why would they do this? Let’s break it down: Trade War Fallout: The ongoing trade war between the US and China isn’t just about tariffs; it’s a complex economic battle. A weaker Yuan can make Chinese exports cheaper, potentially offsetting the impact of US tariffs and supporting China’s export-driven economy. Economic Slowdown Concerns: China’s economy, while still a global powerhouse, has been showing signs of slowing down. Allowing the Yuan to depreciate can provide a boost to domestic industries and stimulate economic activity. PBOC’s Strategic Move: The PBOC , China’s central bank, isn’t passively letting the Yuan slide. They are actively managing the exchange rate, signaling a shift in their approach to currency control. This managed depreciation is a tool to navigate economic headwinds. Think of it like this: imagine a company facing tough competition. They might lower their prices to attract more customers. Similarly, China, facing economic pressures, might be using currency devaluation as a tool to maintain its competitive edge in the global market. The PBOC’s Role: Loosening the Reins The PBOC has historically maintained tight control over the Yuan’s exchange rate. They’ve used various tools, including setting daily fixings and intervening in the forex market , to keep the currency within a desired range. However, recent actions suggest a change in strategy. Here’s what the PBOC has been doing: Weakening the Daily Fixing: The PBOC sets a daily midpoint fixing rate for the Yuan against the US dollar. By setting this fixing weaker, they signal a tolerance for a weaker Yuan in the market. Reduced Intervention: While the PBOC still intervenes in the forex market , there are indications they are doing so less aggressively than before. This reduced intervention allows market forces to play a greater role in determining the Yuan’s value. Signaling Policy Shift: Through their actions and communications, the PBOC is signaling a willingness to let the Yuan find its own level, at least to some extent, in response to market pressures and economic realities. This shift doesn’t mean the PBOC is abandoning control altogether. They are still closely monitoring the situation and have the tools to intervene if they deem the depreciation excessive or destabilizing. It’s more of a calibrated loosening, a strategic adjustment to navigate the current economic climate. Trade War Dynamics: A Currency Battlefield? The trade war between the US and China is undeniably a major factor in the Yuan’s recent weakness. Currencies are often used as weapons in international trade disputes, and the current situation is no different. Let’s examine how the trade war impacts the Chinese Yuan : Factor Impact on Chinese Yuan US Tariffs on Chinese Goods Reduces demand for Chinese exports, potentially weakening the Yuan. Chinese Retaliatory Tariffs Can further strain economic relations and investor sentiment, adding downward pressure on the Yuan. Uncertainty and Risk Aversion Trade war uncertainty increases risk aversion, leading investors to seek safer assets, often away from emerging market currencies like the Yuan. Potential for Further Escalation The risk of further escalation in the trade war keeps downward pressure on the Yuan as markets anticipate continued economic headwinds for China. In essence, the trade war acts as a persistent headwind for the Chinese Yuan . It creates economic uncertainty, dampens investor confidence, and puts pressure on China to use all available tools, including currency management, to mitigate the negative impacts. Forex Market Reactions: Ripple Effects Across Currencies The forex market , a vast and interconnected global marketplace for currencies, is highly sensitive to developments like the Yuan’s depreciation. When a major currency like the Yuan moves significantly, it creates ripples across the entire forex market . Here’s how the forex market is reacting to the Yuan’s decline: Dollar Strength: A weaker Yuan often translates to a stronger US dollar. As investors seek safe-haven assets, the dollar tends to benefit, especially when concerns about global economic stability rise due to events like currency devaluation. Emerging Market Currency Volatility: The Yuan’s weakness can trigger volatility in other emerging market currencies. Investors may become more risk-averse towards emerging markets in general, leading to broader currency sell-offs. Impact on Commodity Prices: Currency fluctuations in major economies like China can influence commodity prices. For example, a weaker Yuan could make commodities priced in US dollars more expensive for Chinese buyers, potentially affecting demand. Trading Opportunities: For savvy forex market participants, volatility creates opportunities. The Yuan’s depreciation and its knock-on effects can lead to increased trading activity and potential profits (and risks!). It’s a complex web of interconnected reactions. The forex market is constantly adjusting and re-pricing assets based on new information and evolving expectations. The Yuan’s movement is a significant piece of this puzzle. What Does This Mean for the Crypto World? Now, you might be wondering, what does all this currency drama have to do with cryptocurrencies? Well, quite a lot, actually. The traditional forex market and the crypto market are increasingly intertwined. Here’s the connection: Safe Haven Narrative: In times of economic uncertainty and currency volatility, some investors turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a potential safe haven. If the Yuan’s depreciation fuels concerns about global economic stability, it could indirectly boost demand for cryptocurrencies. Capital Flight: Currency devaluation can sometimes lead to capital flight, where individuals and businesses move their assets out of a country to protect their value. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized and borderless nature, can be seen as an alternative avenue for capital movement. Macroeconomic Awareness: Understanding macroeconomic trends, like currency movements and trade war dynamics, is becoming increasingly important for crypto investors. These factors can influence market sentiment and investor behavior in the crypto space. Correlation and Diversification: While not always perfectly correlated, the crypto market and traditional financial markets are becoming more connected. Events in the forex market can have ripple effects in the crypto world, and vice versa. Understanding these correlations is crucial for portfolio diversification and risk management. In short, keep an eye on the Chinese Yuan and the broader forex market . These developments are not happening in a vacuum; they are part of a larger global financial picture that increasingly impacts the cryptocurrency landscape. Navigating the Currency Currents: Actionable Insights So, what can you take away from all of this? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated on global economic news, particularly developments related to the Chinese Yuan , the PBOC ‘s policies, and the US-China trade war . Knowledge is power in these volatile times. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including both traditional and crypto assets, can help mitigate risk. Understand Forex Dynamics: Even if you primarily focus on crypto, understanding basic forex market dynamics can provide valuable context and insights into broader market trends. Manage Risk: Currency volatility and economic uncertainty increase risk. Manage your risk accordingly, whether you’re trading crypto or traditional assets. Consider using tools like stop-loss orders and position sizing. Long-Term Perspective: Market fluctuations are normal. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market noise. Conclusion: A World of Interconnected Markets The Chinese Yuan hitting a 17-year low is more than just a currency story; it’s a symptom of broader global economic and geopolitical forces at play. The PBOC ‘s strategic adjustments, the ongoing US-China trade war , and the reactions in the forex market all highlight the interconnectedness of the global financial system. And as the crypto world becomes increasingly integrated with traditional finance, understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the ever-evolving financial landscape. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and remember that in the world of finance, change is the only constant.

Yesterday, the broader crypto market surged after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for 75 countries, while raising China’s tariffs to 125%. Bullish Momentum For Dogecoin The news sent Bitcoin above the $80,000 threshold and catapulted several major altcoins, including Dogecoin, higher. “Daily Bullish divergence on Dogecoin starting to play here,” Kevin writes in his latest update, while cautioning that “obviously macro news has most to do with this, but nonetheless the charts were giving us hints ahead of time that the opportunity was not guaranteed but there.” In the hours following the tariff announcement, Dogecoin rallied by approximately 13%, strengthening signs of a bullish divergence Kevin first flagged two days earlier. “Dogecoin came down once again to test the bull market structure ‘lines in the sand’ and somehow even though it cleanly broke through earlier in the day was able to recover and close the daily candle slightly above this support level,” he explained. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Offload Over 1.32 Billion DOGE In 48 Hours – Risk-Off Or Panic Selling? Kevin noted the parallel between Dogecoin’s bullish divergence and that of Bitcoin on the daily time frame, suggesting that renewed optimism for DOGE may be tied, in part, to the leading cryptocurrency’s resilience above its own pivotal support. Kevin’s outlook is rooted in a multi-week assessment of Dogecoin’s technical posture. At the end of March, he pointed to a “weekly demand candle” and the ‘Last line of bull market support.” He emphasized how crucial it remains for Dogecoin to hold above the 0.139 mark. “It will continue to be absolutely vital that Dogecoin hold this level while it resets higher time frame indicators like the 3 Day MACD, Weekly Stoch RSI and 2W Stoch RSI all of which are getting very close to being fully reset,” he said. DOGE Price Targets He also described the potential upside for Dogecoin as “phenomenal” relative to the risk of losing that $0.139 threshold for multiple weekly closes. The chart’s Fibonacci retracement and extension levels suggest potential technical targets for Dogecoin that remain relevant for traders seeking directional cues. Related Reading: Dogecoin Fading Fervor: Has The Meme Coin Lost Its Mojo? These levels begin with the 0.236 at $0.09038, the 0.382 at $0.13827, the 0.5 at $0.19039, the 0.618 at $0.26216, the 0.65 at $0.28529, and the 0.70 at $0.3310. Higher up, the 0.786 reads $0.41339, the 0.88 is $0.54210, the 1.0 level marks $0.73839, and the 1.0866 is $0.93377. Further on the extension side, the 1.272 stands at $1.54348, and the 1.414 appears at $2.26813. The analyst underscored that “as long as BTC holds these levels and does not lose $70K then I absolutely love this spot on DOGE,” highlighting how the broader market’s trajectory could shape Dogecoin’s path along these technical markers. However, the coming days will reveal whether Dogecoin can build on the momentum that emerged amid the tariff-related market surge—and whether the well-worn phrase “the trend is your friend” will keep Dogecoin enthusiasts in a bullish mindset. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.15751.

While there was a relief in the cryptocurrency market, a stablecoin experienced a decline. Accordingly, the Synthetix (SNX)-based decentralized stablecoin sUSD lost its peg to the dollar and fell below $1. Synthetix-based stablecoin sUSD continued its depeg, falling to levels as low as $0.835. At the time of writing, sUSD has recovered slightly and continues to trade at $0.862. This has raised new concerns about the stability of the project. While the reason for the depeg in sUSD is wondered, according to Fenway, one of the main writers of Synthetix, sUSD lost its fixation to the dollar due to excessive supply in the market. It was stated that the imbalance was seen the most in Curve, as sUSD makes up 75% of the DAI-USDC-USDT-sUSD pool. This was interpreted as a sign that investors were selling the asset. sUSD experienced a similar depeg situation in May 2024 when a major liquidity provider deposited sUSD into Curve. It is stated that one of the reasons for the depeg is that Synthetix founder Kain Warwick announced that he sold 90% of his Ethereum (ETH) assets and increased his SNX position. Accordingly, it is evaluated that the new peg restoration mechanism may be one of the reasons for the depeg of sUSD. sUSD experienced a similar depeg event in May 2024. This depeg was caused by increased sales on decentralized exchanges, and sUSD fell to $0.92. Related News: sUSD Lost Its Stability to $1, This Altcoin Price Reacted! *This is not investment advice.

This initiative, dubbed the “Pax” project, marks a significant step forward in leveraging digital assets for more efficient and cost-effective international money transfers. Are you ready to witness the future of cross-border payments unfold? Unveiling the Pax Project: Revolutionizing Korea Japan Remittances with Stablecoins Shinhan Bank, a financial powerhouse in South Korea, is not just dipping its toes into the digital asset space; it’s diving in headfirst with the “Pax” project. This ambitious undertaking is the first of its kind in South Korea to explore the use of a won-backed digital asset for Korea Japan remittances . But what exactly does this mean for you and the future of finance? Pioneering Initiative: Shinhan Bank is at the forefront, conducting South Korea’s inaugural trial of won-based digital assets for cross-border transfers. Cross-Border Focus: The “Pax” project specifically targets the Korea–Japan remittance corridor, a significant route for financial transactions. Stablecoin Innovation: The project leverages stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, to facilitate these remittances. Why Stablecoins for Cross Border Payments ? The Compelling Benefits Traditional cross-border remittances can be slow, expensive, and often involve multiple intermediaries, leading to higher fees and longer processing times. Stablecoins offer a compelling alternative, promising to streamline these processes and unlock numerous advantages. Let’s break down the key benefits: Benefit Traditional Remittances Stablecoin Remittances Lower Fees Often high due to intermediary banks and transfer services. Potentially significantly lower by reducing intermediaries and leveraging blockchain efficiency. Faster Processing Can take days due to banking hours, international transfers, and settlement processes. Near real-time transactions are possible due to blockchain’s 24/7 operation and faster settlement. Stable Settlement Exchange rate fluctuations can impact the final amount received. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, reducing volatility risks during transfer. Increased Transparency Tracking transfers can be opaque and difficult. Blockchain technology provides transparent and traceable transaction records. The “Pax” project is designed to put these theoretical benefits to the test in a real-world scenario, assessing if stablecoins can truly deliver on their promise of transforming cross border payments . Navigating the Challenges: What are the Hurdles in Digital Asset Remittances? While the potential of stablecoin remittances is immense, the path to widespread adoption isn’t without its challenges. Shinhan Bank’s pilot project is not just about showcasing benefits; it’s also about rigorously testing and understanding the obstacles. What are some of the key hurdles they need to overcome? Regulatory Landscape: Navigating the evolving regulatory frameworks in both South Korea and Japan for digital assets and cross-border transactions is crucial. Clarity and compliance are paramount. Technical Infrastructure: Ensuring robust and secure technical infrastructure to support stablecoin transactions, including wallets, exchanges, and network security, is essential. Institutional Adoption: Gaining acceptance and integration within existing financial institutions and systems requires careful planning and execution. Interoperability is key. Scalability and Security: Testing the scalability of stablecoin solutions to handle significant transaction volumes and ensuring the highest levels of security against cyber threats are vital considerations. User Education and Adoption: Educating users about stablecoins and fostering trust and adoption among both senders and recipients is a long-term endeavor. Shinhan Bank Leading the Charge: Examples of Digital Asset Innovation in Finance Shinhan Bank’s foray into stablecoin remittances is part of a broader trend of financial institutions exploring and adopting digital assets . This isn’t happening in a vacuum. Globally, we are seeing increasing interest and experimentation in this space: JPMorgan Chase’s JPM Coin: A prime example of a major bank utilizing blockchain for internal settlements and cross-border payments between its institutional clients. Visa and Mastercard’s Crypto Partnerships: These payment giants are working with crypto platforms to enable crypto-linked cards and facilitate cryptocurrency payments. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Numerous central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting their own digital currencies, indicating a significant shift towards digital forms of money. Shinhan Bank’s “Pax” project adds to this growing list, demonstrating that traditional financial institutions are not just observing the crypto revolution; they are actively participating and shaping its future. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future of Your Cross Border Payments ? The Shinhan Bank stablecoin remittance trial is more than just a news headline; it offers valuable insights into the future of cross border payments and the broader financial landscape. What can we take away from this development? Potential Cost Savings: For individuals and businesses regularly sending money between Korea and Japan, stablecoin remittances could translate to significant cost reductions in the long run. Faster Transactions: The promise of near real-time transactions means quicker access to funds for recipients, improving efficiency and potentially facilitating faster business operations. Increased Accessibility: Digital asset-based solutions can potentially enhance financial inclusion by offering alternative remittance channels, especially in regions with limited access to traditional banking infrastructure. Innovation in Financial Services: This project signals a wave of innovation in financial services, where traditional institutions are embracing and integrating with digital asset technologies to improve services and efficiency. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step Towards a Digital Remittance Future Shinhan Bank’s “Pax” project is a revolutionary step, showcasing the tangible potential of stablecoins to transform Korea Japan remittances and cross border payments in general. By tackling both the benefits and challenges head-on, this pilot program is paving the way for a future where international money transfers are faster, cheaper, and more efficient. As we watch the results of this trial, one thing is clear: the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance is accelerating, and institutions like Shinhan Bank are leading the charge into this exciting new era.

Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared this on X, noting that he was not expecting it. According to Bloomberg data, the two ETFs, ProShares Ultrashort Ether ETF (ETHD) and T-Rex 2x Inverse Ether Daily Target ETF (ETQ), are up 247.30% and 219% YTD, respectively. The 2x Long VIX Futures ETFs, which Balchunas expected to come first third. Leveraged short ETH Futures ETH are the best performers this year. (Source: Eric Balchunas ) Balchunas said: “The best performing ETF this year is the -2x Ether ETF SETHD, up 247%. #2 is the other -2x Ether ETF. I was sure it would be SUVIX (2x VIX), but that’s #3. Brutal.” Although the two ETH ETFs are not directly shorting Ethereum but instead use ETH futures contracts to bet against the asset, their high-flying performance highlights the token’s struggles. The token already has one of its worst years on record, with an over 50% decline YTD and price at unseen levels since 2022. Interestingly, the two funds have minimal assets under management (AUM) with ETHD having $13.98 million in AUM after an outflow of $6.97 million this year. ETQ is no better, with only $1.57 million AUM despite a slightly positive net flow. The two funds are also down on a long-term basis. ETQ has had a negative 3.56% performance in six months, while ETHD is down 18.09%. Ethereum takes a break from struggles after a pause in tariffs Meanwhile, ETH took a break from its struggles with a more than 10% surge in value after President Donald Trump announced a pause on tariffs for all countries except China for 90 days. Following the news, ETH went from $1,440.82 to $1,687.18, sparking speculation of a rebound. Unsurprisingly, the short ETH ETFs also tanked in value, with ETHD dropping 24% to $55.60 and ETQ falling 24.66% to $23.59. However, they remain up YTD, and the outlook for ETH is still relatively negative, with the token already shedding some of its recent gains. Despite its double-digit percentage gains, ETH remains well below $2,000, and positive sentiments are very slim. Part of the factors behind the worsening sentiment is the capitulation of some long-term holders. According to blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, one whale who has held ETH since it was worth $8 recently dumped 10,702 ETH for $16.86 million after two years of being dormant. The address has a history of selling ETH during major dips, which adds to the growing ETH sell-0ff. Nevertheless, some market experts believe the selloffs by long-term holders could represent a good buying opportunity. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez believes this could be a good entry point for those who want to accumulate. He said: “Long-term #Ethereum $ETH holders have entered “capitulation” mode. For contrarians, this could signal a prime accumulation zone from a risk-reward standpoint.” His view aligns with that of others who believe ETH is already at a bottom and has upcoming bullish events that could lead to a price increase. Crypto influencer Ted Pillows believes that the Pectra upgrade, ETH staking ETFs, and tokenization booms could cause ETH prices to increase significantly. However, many believe the current market uncertainty does not favor a rebound, and ETH could drop lower. CryptoQuant analyst Mac_D has identified $1,290 as the next major support level for ETH, as this is where whales are holding over 100,000 ETH. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

43163825,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148176,1744278631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Crypto Growth? South Korea Eyes Multi-Banking for Crypto Exchanges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-crypto-multi-banking/,"Exciting developments are brewing in the South Korean cryptocurrency market! Imagine a world where crypto exchanges aren’t limited to just one banking partner – sounds like a game-changer, right? Well, that future might be closer than you think. South Korean financial authorities are actively considering a proposal that could revolutionize how crypto exchanges operate in the nation. Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of crypto in South Korea and beyond. Why is South Korea Crypto Exchanges Multi-Banking a Hot Topic? Currently, in South Korea, crypto exchanges typically operate under a real-name verification system, which often necessitates partnering with a single bank. This single-banking partnership can create bottlenecks and limit the operational flexibility of these exchanges. Think of it like having only one checkout counter open in a busy supermarket – things can get slow and congested quickly. The push for allowing crypto exchange multi-banking stems from a proposal by Jung Jin-wan, CEO of Woori Bank. He voiced his support for this change during a meeting with lawmakers from the ruling People Power Party (PPP). This proposal is now under serious consideration by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), signaling a potentially significant shift in Korean crypto regulation . What Benefits Could Cryptocurrency Bank Partnership Bring? Allowing crypto exchanges to partner with multiple banks could unlock a plethora of benefits, not just for the exchanges themselves but also for users and the broader crypto ecosystem. Let’s break down some key advantages: Increased Competition and Better Services: With more banking options, exchanges can shop around for the best terms and services. This competitive environment can lead to lower transaction fees, improved customer service, and a wider range of financial products for crypto users. Reduced Risk of Systemic Failure: Relying on a single bank creates a point of failure. If that bank faces issues or decides to withdraw support, the exchange and its users are significantly impacted. Multi-banking diversifies this risk, making the system more resilient. Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Partnering with multiple banks can streamline transaction processing, improve liquidity management, and reduce operational bottlenecks. This means faster deposits and withdrawals, and a smoother trading experience for users. Greater Innovation in Financial Products: With access to a wider range of banking services and partners, crypto exchanges can explore and offer more innovative financial products and services, potentially bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. Boost to the Crypto Market: A more flexible and efficient banking system can attract more investors and users to the South Korean crypto market, fostering growth and innovation within the sector. Are There Challenges to Consider for Korean Crypto Regulation ? While the prospect of multi-banking is exciting, it’s essential to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations that regulators must address to ensure a smooth and secure transition: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Compliance: Regulators will need to ensure that exchanges partnering with multiple banks maintain robust AML and KYC procedures across all banking relationships. This might require enhanced monitoring and reporting mechanisms. Regulatory Oversight Complexity: Supervising exchanges with multiple banking partners could become more complex for regulators. Clear guidelines and frameworks will be needed to ensure consistent compliance and oversight across all banking relationships. Data Security and Privacy: Sharing user data across multiple banking partners raises concerns about data security and privacy. Robust data protection measures and clear protocols will be crucial to safeguard user information. Potential for Market Fragmentation: If not managed carefully, multi-banking could potentially lead to market fragmentation if different banks have varying compliance standards or operational procedures. Harmonization and standardization will be key. Woori Bank Crypto Initiative: A Catalyst for Change? The proposal from Jung Jin-wan, CEO of Woori Bank Crypto , is particularly noteworthy. Woori Bank, being a major player in the South Korean financial landscape, taking a proactive stance on crypto banking signals a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets within traditional finance. This initiative could act as a catalyst, encouraging other banks to explore partnerships with crypto exchanges and further legitimize the crypto industry in South Korea. It also highlights the increasing recognition that crypto is not a fringe phenomenon but a significant and evolving part of the financial ecosystem. What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Bank Partnership in South Korea? The review by the FSC and FIU is currently underway, and the outcome will be crucial in shaping the future of cryptocurrency bank partnership in South Korea. The fact that this is being actively considered indicates a positive and progressive approach from Korean regulators. Industry experts and crypto enthusiasts are keenly watching these developments. If approved, this multi-banking system could set a new precedent for other jurisdictions grappling with crypto regulation. It could also position South Korea as a more attractive and innovative hub for crypto businesses and investment. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto investors and users, this potential shift towards multi-banking in South Korea is overwhelmingly positive. Here’s what you can expect: Potentially Lower Fees: Increased competition among banks to partner with exchanges could translate to lower transaction fees for users. Improved Service Reliability: A more robust and diversified banking infrastructure means less downtime and more reliable access to your crypto funds. More Innovative Products: Expect to see a wider range of crypto-related financial products and services as exchanges gain more flexibility and banking options. Increased Market Confidence: Regulatory clarity and a more supportive banking environment can boost overall confidence in the South Korean crypto market. Conclusion: A Promising Step Forward for South Korean Crypto South Korea’s consideration of allowing crypto exchange multi-banking represents a potentially transformative step for its cryptocurrency market. While challenges remain, the benefits of increased competition, reduced risk, and enhanced innovation are compelling. This move could not only bolster the South Korean crypto sector but also serve as a model for other nations seeking to integrate digital assets into their financial systems. The world watches with anticipation as South Korea navigates this exciting new frontier in crypto regulation.

Source: Jack Dorsey Dorsey’s call to action was echoed by other industry leaders, including former PayPal president David Marcus, who wrote that “all non-transactional apps should connect to Bitcoin.” The endorsements reflect a growing push to promote Bitcoin as a functional payment system rather than just digital gold or a pure store of value , which alone — according to Dorsey — won’t ensure the success of BTC . Signal offers payments with Sentz, formerly MobileCoin Founded in 2014, Signal is an open-source, encrypted messaging service for instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. The messenger currently offers in-app payments in MobileCoin (MTCN), a privacy-focused ERC-20 token , which rebranded to Sentz in November 2023. Signal’s website mentions the old name of Sentz (MobileCoin) as the only supported cryptocurrency within the messenger. Source: Signal Backed by high-profile industry players like BlockTower Capital and Coinbase Ventures, Sentz was founded in 2017 by Josh Goldbard and Shane Glyn to enable a “fast, private, and easy-to-use cryptocurrency.” Related: Kraken taps Mastercard to launch crypto debit cards in Europe, UK Signal came under fire over its MobileCoin integration in 2021, with many raising concerns over potential ties between Signal’s founder and MTCN, opacity around its issuance and suspicious gains leading up to the partnership’s announcement. Cointelegraph reached out to Signal regarding potential plans to integrate Bitcoin but had not received a response as of publication. Social media apps historically pushed altcoins Signal is far from being alone in pushing altcoin payments instead of offering its users payments in Bitcoin, which is designed for P2P payments as its core use case , according to its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.

ETH ETF Follows! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The global crypto market has jumped 6.7% in the last 24 hours after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause in tariffs , giving a moment of relief for the investors. Despite this crypto market is still struggling in the ETF sector as U.S listed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products continue to see outflows. Bitcoin ETF Outflows Cross $1 Billion Since March 28, Bitcoin ETFs have faced continuous outflows, with total outflows now exceeding $1.03 billion. The only break came on April 2, when an inflow of $218.1 million occurred due to optimism around Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. According to Farside data , Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded their fifth straight day of outflows on April 9, losing $127.2 million. Leading the outflow charge was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw one of the largest sell-offs of $89.7 million, followed by Grayscale (GBTC) with $33.8 million in outflow. The increasing outflow from ETFs has led experts to believe that ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions are pushing investors to liquidate assets, including crypto ETFs, in favor of holding cash. Ethereum ETFs Also Facing Losses Ethereum ETFs are also seeing significant losses. Since the beginning of April, nine ETH ETFs have collectively lost $73 million. On April 9 alone, Ethereum ETFs faced $11.2 million in net outflows . Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF (FETH) led the decline, losing $5.7 million, followed closely by BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA), which saw a $5.5 million outflow. Meanwhile, no other ETF provider has reported any inflows. Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Stay Strong While investors pull money from ETFs, crypto prices continue to climb.

The internet is at a crossroads. People are continuing to express their frustration and dissatisfaction with the internet—double that of what they felt 20 years ago—as centralized platforms are facing increasing scrutiny for their opaque algorithms, data exploitation, and bias in content curation. You might also like: The missing link in a decentralized internet is confidentiality | Opinion Most online platforms today run on web2, where FAANG companies—Meta, formerly known as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet, formerly known as Google—control the data, serve ads, and track users for profit. Users are ultimately the product, and while these companies have added billions in market cap by turning users into the product, this is far from the best model for creating a sustainable knowledge engine like the internet. Participants in the internet ecosystem are starting to wake up to the fact that this model doesn’t really work for anyone except those FAANG companies. Nowhere are these problems more evident than in search. Search is one of the most fundamental activities on the internet and, thus, stands at the forefront of “gatekept content.” If the internet really is our collective knowledge engine, then search is the first step in acquiring that knowledge. It is sometimes even the last and only step in using the internet to acquire knowledge, considering that the first result on a Google page has a clickthrough rate of over 25 percent and the tenth result, proportionately, only has a tenth of that. Presumably, a fraction of that fraction even makes it to the second page of results. Now, consider Google’s prominent position in all of search. Even while Google’s search market share last year dropped below 90 percent for the first time in 10 years, it is still within the range of the popular vote total for a third-world dictator. So, the One True Result that has been served up by Google’s algorithm is getting a quarter of the traffic for the search engine that still holds somewhere in the area of 90 percent of the search engine market share. That’s a lot of opaque and centralized power centered in one private company. Even while competitors like DuckDuckGo and Bing try to carve out some of their own market share by offering AI-powered search or increased privacy, as centralized companies, they fundamentally present the same problem Google does, without the market share. The integrity of our search results has never been more crucial, and we can’t leave it to web2 structures to be good custodians of that integrity, especially when the priorities of those structures to protect their users can turn on a dime. The solution is here: Enter web3 How do we put how information is organized back into the hands of users, especially as the search engines promise to become even more inscrutable with the implementation of AI and the obscuring of sources? One possible way to put that power back into the hands of users is what has thus far been built with web3. Web3 can allow us to build a decentralized, community-powered search engine while participating in a truly open and trustless search ecosystem. A decentralized node-powered ecosystem can ensure fair, unbiased, and censorship-resistant search results, free from the corporate agendas that have shaped traditional search engines. Instead of relying on corporations, web3 platforms are permissionless, sovereign, and decentralized. They are powered by blockchain and smart contracts instead of centralized corporate servers that open users to vulnerabilities and data insecurity. Web3 gives users control back over their data, identity, and digital assets. There are a host of other ways in which web3 can empower the user. These include self-sovereignty, permissionless control of assets without fear of confiscation, self-custodial staking and earning, access for the unbanked, peer-to-peer transfers, and, perhaps most important of all, that fundamental decentralization, which eliminates single points of failure while being resistant to manipulation. There is also no behavioral profiling, no centralized control, and no data tracking. This means no censorship risk, no suppression of competing voices, and a search experience that respects user privacy. Users must work to reclaim power Search engines today function as gatekeepers of information, with centralized platforms deciding which content is amplified, suppressed, or monetized based on user profiles and corporate interests. Users deserve a fairer and ultimately better search experience, one where ranking algorithms are not influenced by personal data, past behavior or profit-driven agendas. The problem is bound to get worse as the AI race heats up and companies look for new data sources on which to train these AIs. Whatever promises a centralized company might have once made to the user about not tracking or using data, again, these priorities can shift very quickly in something like an AI technology realignment. The beauty of web3 is that the structure of the technology itself prevents such exploitation. Web3 may seem abstract right now, but it’s not all that different from the kind of technical fluency users needed to acquire as they went from the personal computer to the networked personal computer of web2. Users essentially just have to trade out an encrypted password shared with a central web service (and who knows where else) for an encrypted wallet that only they can control and access. The benefits of full control over assets and data will far outweigh whatever stumbling blocks there are to this learning curve. Users have shown that they are willing to trade a lot for convenience, but perhaps they’ve reached a breaking point in that bargain. Now is the time for web3 to take advantage.

Data from Whale Alert shows the relation between USDT issuance and Bitcoin price movements by plotting Tether’s net minting and burning alongside the price of Bitcoin from 2015 to early 2025. While many in the industry have long speculated about the correlation between USDT supply and BTC performance, this data set provides a clearer timeline for evaluating that relationship. Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin with over $144 billion in market capitalization, has become a key liquidity vehicle in crypto markets and is often viewed as a proxy for broader capital inflows. The data from Whale Alert reinforces how tightly its issuance patterns track with Bitcoin’s price cycles, though the direction of causality remains up for debate. Large issuances of USDT coincide with Bitcoin price spikes. Source: Whale Alert According to crypto analyst and researcher Mads Eberhardt, a greater supply of stablecoins — including Tether — has historically correlated with positive performance in crypto markets. This relationship is also evident when looking at Tether’s mint and burn chart over time. “However, it’s important to note that we have not observed this correlation over the past few months,” Eberhardt said. “I expect that as stablecoins see increasing adoption in non-native crypto use cases, this correlation will gradually weaken over time.” USDT issuance and Bitcoin price spikes Whale Alert’s data shows a consistent pattern of periods of aggressive USDT minting frequently coinciding with or closely preceding major Bitcoin bull runs. This was also apparent in late 2020 and throughout 2024 when net new USDT issuance climbed into the tens of billions as Bitcoin’s price accelerated upward. A series of large USDT mints in late October and November 2024 accompanied Bitcoin’s rise from $66,700 to over $106,000. Source: Whale Alert In a more recent example, Bitcoin went on a bull run from $66,700 on Oct. 25, 2024, to over $106,000 on Dec. 16 . The first significant mint in this cycle was a $1-billion issuance at the end of BTC’s trip to $72,000 on Oct. 30, before a short-lived correction. Bitcoin had another climb from $65,000 to $75,000, with another $6 billion minted at the end of this rally on Nov. 6. Bitcoin posted moderate gains over the next three days, during which Tether minted an additional $6 billion in two batches. This was followed by a sharp rally that pushed Bitcoin to $88,000. A mint of $6 billion on Nov. 18 marked the beginning of Bitcoin’s next leg up, kicking off a rally that pushed the price to just under $99,000 by Nov. 22. In the same stretch, Tether issued another $9 billion in three separate batches. Another mint of $7 billion on Nov. 23 came just before a brief pullback and Bitcoin’s ultimate surge to $106,000 by Dec. 17. The timing of USDT mints in late 2024 suggests that issuance can serve as a near-term signal of rising demand — but not necessarily as a pure leading indicator. With USDT now over a decade old since its 2014 launch, its role in Bitcoin price cycles is dwindling, Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told Cointelegraph. “Most of the new liquidity entering the Bitcoin market today is coming through MSTR and [exchange-traded funds], primarily via Coinbase’s BTC/USD market or [over-the-counter] desks. Stablecoins are no longer an important signal for determining Bitcoin’s market direction,” Ju said. “In fact, the total amount of stablecoins held on exchanges is lower than it was during the 2021 bull market,” he added. Total stablecoins held on exchanges today is lower than it was during the 2021 bull market. Source: CryptoQuant In many of the observed cases, the largest mints occurred during or after price momentum was already underway. For example, the $6-billion mint on Nov. 6 came after Bitcoin had already rebounded from $65,000 to $75,000. Similarly, more than $15 billion in USDT was minted between Nov. 18 and 23 amid rapid upward price action rather than ahead of it. That said, there are several notable exceptions. A pair of mints totaling $7 billion around Nov. 13 and the $7 billion minted on Nov. 23 appeared shortly before fresh rallies, indicating that in some cases, large issuances may anticipate or help catalyze further price movement. “These days, most newly issued stablecoin liquidity is either for global trade settlements or represents profits from Bitcoin’s rise being converted into liquid form, which increases market cap — not necessarily fresh inflows,” Ju said. Related: Trump ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs create chaos in markets, recession concerns USDT burns and lag behind Bitcoin corrections Conversely, periods of sustained USDT burns — when USDT is removed from circulation — often occur during or shortly after market corrections. This pattern suggests that redemptions tend to follow price pullbacks. This was visible in the weeks after Bitcoin’s December 2024 peak above $106,000. As BTC declined through January and into March 2025, several red bars — representing USDT burns — appeared on the chart. Dec. 26, 2024: A major USDT burn of $3.67 billion occurs just after Bitcoin drops from around $106,000 to $95,713. Dec. 30, 2025: A smaller burn of $2 billion follows as Bitcoin continues to decline toward the $92,000 level. Jan. 10, 2025: A $2.5-billion USDT mint occurs before Bitcoin rebounds to over $106,000. Feb. 28: Another $2 billion in USDT is burned following a month-long decline from Bitcoin’s six-digit peaks to around $84,000. Unlike mints, burns rarely precede downward moves in the same way that some mints appear in front-run rallies. Instead, they tend to confirm what’s already underway. This makes them useful for tracking post-peak behavior and assessing the scale of market cooling, rather than identifying tops in real time. Such patterns are observed throughout USDT’s existence, including a record-breaking $20-billion USDT burn on June 20, 2022, when Bitcoin tumbled from over $65,000 to around $21,000. However, experts agree that burns don’t offer definite post-peak signals: “Currently, we have no evidence of a correlation between burns and market tops, nor as a lagging indicator,” Jos Lazet, founder and CEO of asset management firm Blockrise, told Cointelegraph. Shifting stablecoin landscape impacting the USDT and Bitcoin relationship While historical data shows a clear relationship between USDT supply changes and Bitcoin price movements, there are several factors that impact the price of Bitcoin, and the industry has yet to find concrete evidence that suggests USDT issuance directly influences the price of Bitcoin, or if they flow directly into Bitcoin. “It is not feasible to relate USDT supply (or minting) to a specific trading volume, as the majority of the trading against stablecoins happens on centralized exchanges, especially relating to Bitcoin,” Lazet said. “What can be easily seen is that the (far) majority of the trading volume relates to Bitcoin, and similarly the Bitcoin trading volume is largely done against USDT. However it (probably) won't be feasible to directly correlate these events.” While the connection between USDT issuance and Bitcoin price action remains debated, external forces could soon reshape how stablecoins interact with crypto markets. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework places new compliance requirements on stablecoin issuers operating within the European Union. As a result, several exchanges have announced the delisting of USDT from their platforms . In the US, the proposed legislation could also reshape how centralized stablecoins like USDT are issued, backed and redeemed. Increased regulatory scrutiny may reduce the flexibility and responsiveness of issuers or prompt a shift toward more compliant alternatives.

Rivals like USDC ( USDC ), with a strong compliance posture , are gaining ground, especially among institutions. USDC lost a chunk of its market cap in 2022 and 2023 following the Silicon Valley Bank debacle , dropping from around $56 billion to around $24 billion. Since then, it has recovered to an all-time high market capitalization of over $60 billion at time of writing. USDC market capitalization has recovered to an all-time high.

Tether’s influence on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remains significant. But whether USDT mints and burns will continue to serve as reliable indicators of capital flow in the coming years will be influenced by how regulatory forces, user preferences and infrastructure developments reshape the stablecoin landscape.

Upbit, one of South Korea’s leading crypto exchanges, and its parent company, Dunamu, can breathe a sigh of relief as approximately 13.4 billion won ($9.2 million) in corporate and income taxes, initially imposed by the National Tax Service (NTS), have been officially canceled. This landmark decision, finalized on February 7th, not only marks a victory for Dunamu but also sets a potentially crucial precedent for how crypto taxes are handled in the region. Let’s delve into the details of this fascinating case and understand what it means for the future of crypto businesses in South Korea and beyond. What Sparked the Tax Dispute Between Dunamu and the NTS? The heart of the matter lies in the tax assessment issued by the National Tax Service (NTS) back in January 2023. While the specifics of the NTS’s initial assessment haven’t been explicitly detailed, it’s understood that the dispute revolved around the classification and taxation of certain transactions or income streams within Dunamu’s operations. It’s common for emerging industries like cryptocurrency to face ambiguity in existing tax laws, leading to differing interpretations between businesses and tax authorities. This tax dispute highlights the ongoing challenges in applying traditional tax frameworks to the novel world of digital assets. Here’s a breakdown of the key events: January 2023: The National Tax Service (NTS) initially imposes approximately 13.4 billion won ($9.2 million) in corporate and income taxes on Dunamu, the parent company of Upbit . January 17, 2024: A lower court rules in favor of Dunamu, overturning the NTS’s tax imposition. February 7, 2024: The Seoul High Court upholds the lower court’s decision. The NTS decides not to appeal to the Supreme Court, making the ruling final. Why Did the Courts Side with Upbit ‘s Parent Company? While the full legal reasoning behind the court’s decisions isn’t publicly available in detail, the fact that both the lower court and the Seoul High Court ruled in favor of Dunamu, and the NTS chose not to pursue a Supreme Court appeal, suggests a strong legal basis for Dunamu’s position. Several factors could have contributed to this outcome: Ambiguity in Tax Law: Existing tax laws might not clearly define how certain cryptocurrency-related activities should be taxed. This ambiguity could have been interpreted in Dunamu’s favor. Arguments Presented by Dunamu: Dunamu likely presented a robust legal argument demonstrating why the NTS’s tax assessment was incorrect or misapplied. This could have included expert testimonies, detailed financial records, and legal precedents. Court’s Interpretation: The courts may have adopted a more nuanced interpretation of the tax laws in the context of cryptocurrency transactions, potentially acknowledging the unique nature of digital assets and their operations. It’s important to remember that tax law is complex and often subject to interpretation. In emerging sectors like crypto, these interpretations can be even more critical. This case underscores the need for clearer regulatory frameworks surrounding crypto taxes . South Korea Crypto Exchange Landscape and Regulatory Scrutiny South Korea has emerged as a significant hub for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. Exchanges like Upbit , Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit are among the most active globally. However, this vibrant market has also attracted considerable regulatory attention. The South Korean government has been actively working to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the crypto sector, balancing innovation with investor protection and tax compliance. Here are some key aspects of the South Korea crypto exchange landscape: Stringent KYC/AML Regulations: South Korean exchanges are subject to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to prevent illicit activities. Real-Name Verification System: Trading on exchanges generally requires real-name verification of accounts linked to bank accounts. Taxation of Crypto Gains: South Korea has implemented taxation on capital gains from cryptocurrency trading, although the implementation details and thresholds have been subject to adjustments and discussions. Ongoing Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea is still evolving, with ongoing discussions and refinements in areas like licensing, consumer protection, and cross-border transactions. The legal battle between Dunamu and the NTS is taking place within this dynamic regulatory environment. It highlights the challenges both businesses and regulators face in navigating the complexities of crypto taxes . Implications of the Ruling for Dunamu and the Crypto Industry The Seoul High Court’s decision to cancel the $9 million tax bill is undoubtedly a major victory for Dunamu . Beyond the immediate financial relief, this ruling carries several significant implications: Financial Relief: The immediate benefit is the avoidance of a substantial $9 million tax payment, freeing up capital for Dunamu to invest in growth, innovation, and operations. Precedent Setting: This case could set a legal precedent for future crypto taxes disputes in South Korea, potentially influencing how tax authorities interpret and apply tax laws to cryptocurrency businesses. Increased Confidence: The ruling may boost investor confidence in Dunamu and Upbit , signaling a more favorable legal and regulatory environment for their operations. Industry-Wide Impact: Other cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses in South Korea and potentially even internationally may look to this case as a benchmark for their own tax planning and legal strategies. Catalyst for Regulatory Clarity: This case could prompt further dialogue and action towards establishing clearer and more specific tax regulations for the cryptocurrency industry in South Korea, reducing future ambiguities and disputes. This ruling serves as a powerful reminder that the legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still being shaped, and court decisions play a vital role in defining the boundaries and interpretations of existing laws. What’s Next for Crypto Tax Regulations in South Korea? While this ruling is a win for Dunamu, it also underscores the ongoing need for greater clarity and precision in crypto tax regulations in South Korea and globally. Here are some potential future developments: Legislative Updates: The South Korean legislature may consider amending existing tax laws or enacting new legislation specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of cryptocurrency transactions and businesses. NTS Guidance: The National Tax Service might issue more detailed guidelines and interpretations on crypto taxes to provide clearer direction to businesses and taxpayers. International Cooperation: As cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon, increased international cooperation among tax authorities could lead to more consistent and harmonized approaches to crypto taxes . Continued Legal Challenges: Despite this ruling, we can expect ongoing legal challenges and court cases as the application of tax laws to the evolving crypto landscape continues to be debated and refined. The Dunamu case is a significant milestone, but it’s just one step in the ongoing journey towards establishing a clear, fair, and effective regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the crucial area of crypto taxes . Conclusion: A Victory for Clarity in Crypto Taxation? The Seoul High Court’s decision to cancel the $9 million tax bill for Upbit ‘s parent company, Dunamu, represents more than just a financial reprieve. It’s a potential landmark ruling that highlights the complexities of applying traditional tax laws to the innovative and rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. This victory for Dunamu could pave the way for greater clarity in crypto taxes regulations in South Korea and serve as an important case study for other jurisdictions grappling with similar challenges. As the cryptocurrency industry matures, it is imperative that regulators and lawmakers work collaboratively with businesses to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while ensuring fair and transparent tax practices. The Dunamu case underscores the importance of this ongoing dialogue and the crucial role of the courts in interpreting and shaping the future of crypto regulation.

This was as President Trump announced a 90-day pause in his imposition of tariffs. The pause was for all countries except China, which now has its levy increased to a whopping 125%. Tariffs pause ignites markets Seemingly with no end in sight, President Trump’s tariff strategy was strangling the global economy and sending stock markets into a tailspin. However, in one false swoop on Wednesday, the announcement came that all tariffs would now be paused for 90 days, except for those on China, which were raised to 125%. On the news, markets shot into the green and started climbing as if they had left a huge weight behind. The S&P 500 finished the day up 9.52%, the Nasdaq Composite at 12.16%, and the Dow Jones 7.87%. So are the tariff terrors now done with? It would seem that with China, the biggest producer nation on the earth, tariffed at 125%, and with signals out of the country that it would fight to the end, there is still some way to go in order to put global trade and supply lines back on track. At least for now there is a decent let-up in the awful chain of bad news regarding the tariffs. As if to swing markets back into the green and avoid the plunge gaining momentum, Trump himself posted on Truth Social on Wednesday: “This is a great time to buy!!!” Also, only three days ago, Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, said that the market situation was a “buying opportunity”, and that he did not see any systemic risks going into the longer term. $BTC must still make a higher high Source: TradingView Despite the big price increase on Wednesday, the short-term chart for $BTC shows that there is still quite a way to go to make a higher high and start reversing the current downward trend. The price is currently coming back down, and could retest the horizontal support. This is also the neckline of the small W pattern. If the retest is successful, the measured move of this pattern would take the price up to $86,500. This would be beyond the descending trendline, but still lower than the last pivot high, so a rejection and another lower high could see the price descend again. Bitcoin bull market still in the balance Source: TradingView The weekly chart for the $BTC price shows that things are still balanced on a knife edge. The price is adjacent to the descending trendline, and is still holding above the 50-week SMA. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line is once again above the hugely influential 44.00 level. While the Stochastic RSI at the very bottom of the chart is still shaping to turn back down, it does look like there is still life left in this bull market. Much will depend on the progress of tariffs, and especially the situation with China. Will Trump be able to pull another rabbit out of the hat?

The increase in trade penalties forces the hands of retailers and wholesalers in China’s e-commerce industry to recover what they pay for imports by adding charges on consumers. President Trump announced Wednesday that his administration has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, up from the initial level of 104%. The move is expected to directly affect tens of thousands of Chinese Amazon merchants who rely heavily on American consumer demand. “ This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed, ” said Wang Xin, head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association. The group represents over 3,000 Amazon sellers in China. Speaking to Reuters, Wang said high trade levies could paralyze sellers who now face higher shipping costs, customs complications, and the challenge of staying profitable. “ For all of us in the cross-border e-commerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow, ” she added. Price increase or exit plan as the only options Of every five Shenzhen-based Amazon merchants interviewed by Reuters, three said they plan to raise prices in the US to offset the new costs. The remaining two intend to withdraw from the market entirely and redirect sales to other regions, such as Europe, Canada, and Mexico. Dave Fong, an Amazon seller whose inventory includes Bluetooth speakers and schoolbags, said he had no choice but to hike prices up to 30% for American buyers. He also plans to reduce spending on Amazon advertising, which previously consumed 40% of his US revenue. “ For us and anyone else, you can’t rely on the US market, that’s quite clear, ” Fong complained. Much like most retailers sourcing products from China, he said he will have to scale back investments in America and reallocate resources to other global markets, where there’s a better chance to make sales, talk less of counting profits. Brian Miller, another merchant on Amazon who has operated in Shenzhen for seven years, said he no longer sees the US as a viable market for China-based manufacturers. Miller mentioned the increased burden tariffs place on production costs, saying a children’s building block set that once cost $3 to manufacture now totals $7 after factoring in the 125% tariff. To maintain profit margins, Miller said the retail price of such toys would need to jump by at least 20%. For higher-cost items, price increases of up to 50% may be required. “ I don’t see a scenario, if things don’t change, that serving the US from China is viable any more. Manufacturers may need to be relocated to countries such as Vietnam or Mexico, ” he remarked. China is Amazon’s best seller and cross-border trade base MarketPlace Pulse places more than half of all Amazon sellers in China, with the city of Shenzhen alone hosting over 100,000 Amazon businesses. These sellers generated a combined $35.3 billion in annual revenue, according to e-commerce analytics firm SmartScout. Beyond Amazon, China serves as the manufacturing hub for other platforms like Shein and Temu. Cross-border e-commerce trade from China was valued at 2.63 trillion yuan ($358 billion) in 2023, according to China’s State Council. Yet, sellers warn that no other market offers the consumption power of the US, so changing the market target to new regions is using a band-aid to cover a huge cut, at best. Without access to American buyers, Chinese exporters will have to fight to sell their products at home and in smaller global markets, which could create price wars and, inevitably, bring down profitability to almost nought point nought. US consumers will also feel the effects US households are looking at the “short-term pain” President Trump mentioned: and that includes rising prices on commonly imported goods. According to the US Department of Commerce’s Office of Industry and Security, machinery, sound recording equipment, and televisions were among the most imported commodities from China in 2022. These sectors accounted for 46.4% of all Chinese imports to the US that year. The latest flagship iPhone, the 16 Pro Max, was previously projected to cost as much as $2,000 under lower tariff levels of 54% if Apple chose not to absorb the added costs. With tariffs now more than doubling, those prices could climb even higher. Sellers also have to deal with the expiration of the de minimis exemption , which has allowed goods under $800 in value to enter the US duty-free. According to several sources that investigated the matter earlier this year, more than half of these shipments come from China, and over 30% are linked to Shein and Temu. After midnight May 1, packages under $800 from China will be taxed at 90% of their declared value or $75 per item, or whichever is higher. Beginning June 1, the per-item minimum will double to $150, according to a White House announcement issued last Tuesday.

Solana price followed a wider crypto and stock market recovery after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a change in trade wars. “I have authorized a 90-day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10 percent, also effective immediately,” Trump noted. Solana Network Activity Spikes In the past few weeks, the Solana network has recorded a significant decline in on-chain activity. However, top DeFi developers on the Solana ecosystem have been juicing up their protocols – led by the reintroduction of streaming services on Pump.fun – to attract new users globally. According to market data from defillama , Solana’s DEX volume led other layer one chains in the last 24 hours, after hitting $2.77 billion. As more fund managers, led by Fidelity , push the U.S. SEC to approve spot Solana ETFs, on-chain data shows a spike in whale activity for SOL. For instance, on-chain data provided by Lookonchain , a long-term whale purchased 32k SOL in the past 24 hours. A whale bought another 32,000 $SOL ($3.72M) after 6 months. This whale seems to be extremely bullish on $SOL .

This increase comes amid a broader crypto market recovery, driven by President Trump’s decision to suspend US tariffs . However, despite the optimism, risks loom large due to the uncertainty surrounding a potential listing on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The community’s push for this listing has yet to yield results, raising questions about Pi’s long-term viability. Why is the Pi Network price rising today? Today’s 4.9% surge in Pi Network’s price can be attributed to a broader cryptocurrency market revival following the US government’s decision to suspend recently announced tariffs to ease trade tensions. President Donald Trump’s suspension of the new tariffs for 90 days has boosted investor confidence across markets, including the crypto market. This positive sentiment has lifted major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), which briefly surged past $83,000. Pi Network (PI), riding this wave, has also seen its price climb as a result. Strategic partnerships also contribute to the current PI price surge. Pi Network recently teamed up with Banxa, a global payment service provider, and Banxa reportedly snapped up over 30 million PI tokens, boosting demand. Within 48 hours of the partnership announcement, Pi News, which recently partnered with Pi CrowdFund — the first crowdfunding platform built on the Pi Network ecosystem, reported that 1.2 million PI tokens had been purchased from Banxa, showcasing strong community engagement. Pi News @PiNewsMedia · Follow BREAKING: 1.2 million $PI were purchased from Banxa in the last 48 hours. Break down. Wallet “URB” had a balance of 15.3M now at 14.7M $PI .

More utilities more demand. #PiNetwork 5:04 pm · 8 Apr 2025 1.7K Reply Copy link Read 116 replies Community optimism is another key driver behind the current Pi Network price surge. Binance listing uncertainty tempers the optimism Amid the current Pi Network price recovery, the uncertainty over a Binance listing looms as a major risk. Notably, despite a community poll with over 2 million votes in favor during the Binance Community Vote conducted in February , Binance has not listed PI. This silence has frustrated many supporters, who are now skeptical of the altcoin getting listed by Binance anytime soon. Several factors could, however, explain Binance’s hesitation to list PI. Firstly, PI operates on its own blockchain, not the BNB Smart Chain preferred by Binance. In addition, transparency issues persist, with Pi Network lacking detailed token economics disclosure. Regulatory concerns in places like Vietnam and China, where Pi’s referral model raises red flags, also add further complications. The lack of a Binance listing has hurt Pi’s market performance, with PI’s price plummeting 80% from its all-time high despite listing on smaller exchanges like OKX and Bitget, which offer limited exposure compared to Binance. Inflation fears with the April token unlock While Binance listing uncertainty has been a major issue for Pi Network, internal issues compound Pi’s struggles. Notably, inflation pressure looms with over 124 million PI set to unlock in April. Also, the token migration process has been rocky , with users reporting lost tokens or KYC delays, eroding trust in the project. What’s next for Pi Network? Despite these hurdles, Pi Network holds potential. Its massive user base creates a built-in market for PI. Initiatives like PiFest, with over 125,000 merchants accepting Pi, highlight its real-world utility. Pi Network @PiCoreTeam · Follow The first PiFest in Open Network showcased record participation.

No publicly traded miner with a top-ten market cap comes close to these levels. At a 77% BTC-backing, only MARA Holdings has a stronger 'floor price' backed by Bitcoin held on the corporate balance sheet. The company plans to use its ATM to fund growth, dilution is a valid concern. But with positive news on tariffs and a market desperate for a relief rally, I think HIVE will outperform other mining stocks. In December of last year, I upgraded HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE ) to a 'buy' after calling it a 'hold' in late-April 2024. The stock proceeded to fall more than 65% virtually in a straight line: HIVE Coverage (Seeking Alpha) What can I say? That was a bad call, and it won't be the last one I make in my life. Such was the case even in April 2024 when my 'hold' designation preceded a 35% rally in HIVE. This inability to get the timing right on HIVE has been a more recent phenomenon, however. My original rating on HIVE in August 2022 was a 'sell.' The price of the stock at that time was $5 per share. I followed that up with a reiterated 'sell' in July 2023 and both of those pieces still hold up today. In this update, we'll look at HIVE's updated performance through December 2024 as well as valuation considerations that I think shareholders might want to consider. Recent Earnings and Production Fundamentally, I still think HIVE has more work to do from a business transformation standpoint before the company gets interesting as a long-term investment. Top-line revenue declined year over year from $31.3 million for the three months ended December 2023 to $29.2 million in the same period in 2024. HIVE Net Income (HIVE Digital Technologies) The company's revenue is still largely dependent on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining with over 91% of HIVE's top-line coming from the digital currency mining segment. The good news is, if you're bullish HIVE for the HPC revenue, the company is indeed scaling that segment. After generating just $1.6 million in HPC revenue through the nine months ended December 2023, that segment is up 336% through the nine months ended December 2024 and is on pace to generate more than 8% of the top line for the full fiscal year. At $1.3 million, HIVE reported positive net income for the quarter-ended December. But bear in mind, like just about every Bitcoin mining company in the public markets, positive net income is generally due to unrealized gains on assets. For the 9 months-ended December, HIVE reported an unrealized gain on investments of $25.8 million, gains on sales of equipment of $16.4 million, and still managed to generate a net loss of $3.1 million so far for the fiscal year. HIVE Monthly Production (Company Filings, Author's Chart) Q1 numbers will likely show margin pressures as the company mined 24 less Bitcoin sequentially but grew exahash capacity from 5.5 EH/s in December to 6.3 in March 2025. The company's scaling plans are really just getting started. HIVE recently purchased the Yguazú mine site from Bitfarms ( BITF ). With HIVE's other mine site in Paraguay also scheduled for completion in 2025, the company is projecting 25 EH/s this year. If the company can achieve such a number, it would make HIVE a top five publicly traded Bitcoin miner by EH/s. To fund this growth, the company is planning to tap the ATM as well as utilize BTC on the balance sheet. The 'Deep Value' Miner Despite the obvious profitability issues that are shared by all public BTC miners, HIVE is bordering on what I'd call 'deep value' in the Bitcoin mining sector. At a $1.52 per share closing price on April 9th, HIVE trades at a 57% discount to book value and at just 1.25x sales. Seeking Alpha gives the stock a valuation grade of 'A' and I like it down here as well. BTC Miner Comps (Seeking Alpha) There is no miner in this screen-grab above that trades at a lower multiple in either P/B or P/S metric, let alone both. Furthermore, HIVE's long-term debt to total capital percentage of less than 3% would make it one of the least-levered stocks in the sector. What I like best about HIVE right now though is how depressed the stock price valuation is relative to other mining stocks with similar Bitcoin mining production numbers and HODL stacks. BTC Miner BTC HODL Stack BTC Value, m Market Cap, m BTC/Market Cap Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 47,600 $3,965.1 $4,300.0 92.21% Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 19,223 $1,601.3 $2,600.0 61.59% CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 11,869 $988.7 $2,100.0 47.08% Hut 8 ( HUT ) 10,273 $855.7 $1,300.0 65.83% HIVE Digital 2,201 $183.3 $237.1 77.33% Source: Bitcoin Treasuries, as of 4/9/25 at $83.3k BTC There are over a dozen publicly traded mining stocks that have a larger market capitalization than HIVE yet only five were holding more Bitcoin at the end of March. At a 77% BTC/market cap backing, MARA Holdings - which I also think is a buy at this point - is the only miner with a larger BTC/MC. The most glaring issue for me is the capital needed to fund growth in Paraguay. Data by YCharts Up until now, HIVE has not been among the worst dilution offenders in the market and has grown shares outstanding by just 89% in the last three years. While up year over year, 'sats per share' at the end of December came in at just over 2k sats per share. This shows a continuation of a long-term trend down for HIVE: 'Sats per Share' (HIVE, Author's Chart) I suspect this figure will be quite a bit lower in HIVE's next quarterly report since the HODL has declined by over 600 BTC since the end of December. Still, the think the market has priced in a lot of this already. Closing Summary For me, HIVE Digital is an odd outlier in the Bitcoin mining sector. We saw companies that were prioritizing HPC/AI services as complimentary revenue streams generally well-rewarded by the market for most of 2024. HIVE appears to be one of the few BTC mining stocks that is actually generating/growing revenue in this area. Yet, the stock has been one of the worst performers in the mining space over the last twelve months. The company hasn't diluted shareholders nearly as much as mining peers and generally has strong efficiency metrics relative to other public miners. In my view, HIVE is like a cheap call option for higher Bitcoin prices. The shares have a large BTC-backing at 77% of the market cap of the company. Higher BTC prices should push HIVE up as well, since over 90% of the company's revenue is BTC-denominated. There are glaring long-term profitability concerns due to the economics of mining Bitcoin.

This surge comes after President Donald Trump’s surprise decision to pause most tariffs for 90 days. While investors see this as a glimmer of hope, financial analyst and Whalewire founder Jacob King warns of an upcoming crash. He warns that this surge is just a “dead cat bounce”—a temporary rise before another major crash. Retail Investors Falling for the Trap? According to Jacob King, a well-known market analyst, this recent rally could be a “dead cat bounce”, a temporary recovery before another major downturn. Further, Jacob explained that delaying tariffs by 90 days has created a sense of hope, making small investors think the worst is over. Meanwhile, big institutions, which have already made profits, are using this opportunity to sell their holdings before prices fall again. Exactly as predicted, we’ve officially entered the dead cat bounce phase: delay the tariffs, bait the retail crowd back in, and set the stage for the next red wave. In the coming weeks, retail will pile in—all while institutions quietly dump their bags. Don’t forget the long… — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) April 9, 2025 In a tweet, King said, “Exactly as predicted, we’ve officially entered the dead cat bounce phase: delay the tariffs, bait the retail crowd back in, and set the stage for the next red wave.” Market Data Confirms Prediction However, market data supports his concerns. Despite the recent price surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum, U.S. listed Bitcoin ETFs continue to experience massive outflows, exceeding $1 billion in the recent two weeks. Even Ethereum ETFs have seen an overall outflow of 73 million, showing that institutional investors are choosing to cash out rather than hold on. Could This Rally Be Different? Not everyone thinks this surge is a trap. Prominent analyst Amit believes the last market bounce was weak because it had no real reason behind it. This time, he sees things differently. “If the tariffs are delayed, we finally have a real reason for the market to go up.” Amit further explained that the 10% tariffs were already priced in. But if the 90-day pause leads to a deal with China, the market could stay strong instead of crashing again. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ghiblification (GHIBLI) is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. It draws inspiration from the Ghibli-styled ChatGPT-generated images, which are influenced by the aesthetic work of Studio Ghibli, a Japanese animation studio. The token gained viral traction shortly after its launch on March 25, 2025, via the @ghibli account on X. Riding a wave of community-generated content on social media, particularly X, GHIBLI saw a sharp price rise, peaking at $0.03918 on March 28, 2025, before declining to $0.0033 by April 7. During this period, its market capitalization fell from $39.179 million to $3.37 million. In its first 24 hours, the GHIBLI/SOL trading pair jumped 37%, signaling strong investor interest. Some traders view this as a hopeful signal for the memecoin sector, which has slumped by more than 50% since December 2024. The total token supply of GHIBLI memecoin is capped at 1 billion, with over 999 million currently in circulation. Studio Ghibli, founded in 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki, is known for its meticulously hand-drawn animation, richly detailed backgrounds and emotional storytelling. By April 7, 2024, the studio had produced 22 full-length animated features. Some well-known films by the studio include Grave of the Fireflies (1998), Spirited Away (2001) and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (2013). GHIBLI reflects the emerging pattern of memecoins driven by cultural references and movements. It follows in the footsteps of the CHILLGUY token launched on the Solana blockchain on Nov. 15, leveraging the viral “Just a chill guy” meme. By Nov. 27, CHILLGUY propelled to a $643-million market capitalization, though its value sharply declined later. Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that take a humorous jab at mainstream cryptocurrencies and their disruptive aspirations against traditional finance. Their very existence stems from viral internet memes. Since the introduction of ChatGPT’s image generation feature, several memecoins linked to the feature have emerged on the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. Did you know? The studio’s name, “Ghibli,” is derived from a Libyan Arabic word meaning a hot desert wind. How to buy GHIBLI on a Solana-based DEX To purchase GHIBLI memecoin on a Solana-based DEX, you need to set up a wallet, acquire SOL, connect to a DEX, and swap SOL for GHIBLI. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to purchase GHIBLI memecoin on a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) : Step 1: Set up a cryptocurrency wallet Install Trust Wallet by downloading it from the official Trust Wallet website or Google Play Store. Complete the setup process. Securely store your seed phrase . It is essential to recover your wallet if any issues arise. Step 2: Acquire SOL and transfer it to your wallet Purchase Solana ( SOL ) on a centralized exchange like Binance or another platform that facilitates SOL trading. Transfer the SOL to your Trust Wallet address via the Solana network. Step 3: Connect to a DEX Visit a Solana-supported DEX. Connect your Trust Wallet to the platform. Step 4: Purchase GHIBLI After connecting your wallet, locate a trading pair like SOL/USDT or SOL/GHIBLI on the DEX. Specify how much SOL you want to swap for GHIBLI and finalize the transaction. Once the swap is complete, the GHIBLI tokens will appear in your Trust Wallet. Did you know? Studio Ghibli, known for its whimsical and dreamlike animation style, puts a strong emphasis on hand-drawn animation, even in the digital age. GHIBLI memecoins — From AI art to crypto craze The rise of GHIBLI memecoins began with the viral impact of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o update on March 25, 2025. This update introduced a unique feature that allowed users to transform regular images into the iconic art style of Studio Ghibli. GHIBLI represents a growing trend of anime-themed tokens gaining traction, fueled by increasing interest in both Japanese animation and AI-generated art. Days after the launch of GHIBLI anime images, an overwhelming number of users, including influencers and politicians, started using ChatGPT to transform their images into art. This intense interest in the new image-generation capability resulted in an 11% increase in global downloads and a 5% rise in weekly active users compared to the previous week of launch, while in-app purchase revenue also grew by 6%. According to data from market research firm Similarweb, the number of average weekly active users breached the 150 million mark for the first time in 2025. The extensive demand placed a significant load on OpenAI’s servers, leading to temporary restrictions on users accessing the tool. As Ghibli-style images flooded social media, the Ghiblification phenomenon quickly inspired a new wave of anime-themed memecoins. These tokens, themed after Studio Ghibli’s timeless creations like Howl’s Moving Castle and Kiki’s Delivery Service, captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts. Rather than offering traditional utility, Ghibli memecoins thrive on cultural nostalgia and online hype. Leading the movement is GHIBLI, which became the face of the trend. What began as a viral AI art trend soon evolved into a full-blown crypto sensation, transforming playful creativity into market momentum almost overnight. Interestingly, similar memecoins failed to gain traction. For instance, Ghibli Rizzler (GRIZLLER) attained a market capitalization of $6,000, while Ghibli Sigma (GIGMA) and Ghibli Mona Lisa (GLISA) fared even worse, reaching meager market caps of just $4,200 and $3,800, respectively. Most memecoins are created anonymously, making it very difficult to verify if they are legitimate or safe investments. Only investors with advanced Web3 skills can access the vetting methods necessary to determine the legitimacy of these projects, as the available vetting tools primarily require a high level of Web3 expertise. Did you know? Sam Altman , founder and CEO of OpenAI, has suggested an upcoming version of the feature, which will be more advanced than the current one. No wonder the next version of the anime images tool propels another memecoin spree. What fueled the GHIBLI memecoin surge? The way GHIBLI memecoin prices fluctuate isn’t just by chance; it’s driven by a blend of cutting-edge technology, celebrity buzz and a market eager to chase the next big trend. Backing by top tech influencers Tech influencers like Sam Altman and Elon Musk helped amplify the trend. On March 27, 2025, just after the launch of the GHIBLI feature — Musk posted a hilarious image of himself as Rafiki from The Lion King, raising a Dogecoin mascot in the air. That post alone triggered massive attention for Ghibli-themed tokens. Five days later, on April 6, Altman also posted a playful Ghibli-themed image on X, giving another push to the image-generating feature. Joining the Ghibli trend, Binance co-founder and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao updated his X profile picture in the style of the animation studio. White House crypto czar David Sacks also participated, sharing a Ghibli-esque image of himself with the US president working in the office. Massive market gains Post-launch, GHIBLI experienced a sharp rise in value, exceeding 40,000% within a 24-hour period. Getting listed on exchanges like Gate.io and Binance Alpha added credibility to the token and sparked a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors eager for big returns. Emotional appeal Studio Ghibli’s storytelling and beloved characters evoke strong emotional connections worldwide. Their timeless charm blends perfectly with the memecoin formula of fun, fandom and hype. For many, buying GHIBLI tokens feels like honoring their favorite anime memories while riding the wave of a hot trend. Vibrant community On social media, GHIBLI’s community is thriving. Users have been sharing memes, tips and posts out of excitement and are pumping the token in the process. The energy resembles the early Dogecoin ( DOGE ) days, though it has an anime twist with GHIBLI. Risk factors concerning GHIBLI memecoin Potential investors in GHIBLI should consider volatility, possible legal issues and the ethical considerations highlighted by Studio Ghibli’s leadership. Here’s what you need to know: Volatility and trend dependency: Ghibli memecoins, while currently popular, are highly susceptible to the transient nature of internet trends. Their value is closely tied to the trend of ghiblification. As this trend loses steam, the tokens’ appeal and market value are likely to go down as well. Historical precedents, such as the rapid rise and fall of memecoins like CHILLGUY, highlight the probability of significant losses after the initial excitement subsides.​ Legal and ethical considerations: Studio Ghibli has a history of actively protecting its intellectual property. The studio has previously taken legal action against unauthorized use of its artwork, emphasizing its commitment to safeguarding its creations. The emergence of Ghibli-themed memecoins and AI-generated art raises concerns about potential copyright infringements. Studio Ghibli could pursue action against organizations that take advantage of its distinctive style without permission, especially if such use dilutes the brand value of the studio. ​ Miyazaki’s stance on AI and artistic integrity: Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Studio Ghibli, strongly disapproves of AI-generated art. In a 2016 documentary, he described such creations as “an insult to life itself,” underscoring his belief that AI cannot capture the depth of human experience essential to authentic artistry. This perspective adds an ethical dimension to the proliferation of AI-generated Ghibli-style images and related memecoins.​ How to do spot trading of GHIBLI GHIBLI has been listed on centralized exchanges such as Gate.io and Kraken for spot trading . For spot trading on centralized exchanges, you must deposit funds on the exchange or purchase stablecoins such as Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) or USDC ( USDC ). You navigate to the “Spot Trading” page, select a trading pair, and execute trades using market or limit orders. Here is the process for spot trading in more detail: Create an account: If you don’t have one, create an account on the exchange. Deposit funds: Deposit funds into your Gate.io account using an approved method or purchase compatible stablecoins. Navigate to spot trading: Go to the “Spot Trading” page on the platform. Select a trading pair: Select the cryptocurrency pair you want to trade (e.g., GHIBLI/USDC). Place orders: You have two options: market order and limit order . With a market order, you can execute a trade at the current market price, whereas with a limit order, you can set a specific price for buying or selling. Monitor and close positions: Monitor your trades and close your positions when desired. Caution! Centralized exchanges carry risks — hacks have cost billions (e.g., Mt. Gox in 2014 and Bybit hack in 2025 ), liquidity can dry up during volatility, and regulatory shifts may freeze funds. Verify platform security, fees and withdrawal limits before committing. Research GHIBLI’s volatility and exchange reputation to avoid losses. Moreover, memecoins like TRUMP and GHIBLI carry risks: Their hype-driven volatility can lead to rapid losses, and scams or rug pulls often target uninformed investors. Therefore, with full self-ownership, always protect your keys and funds; scams exploit the unwary.",GIBLI|memecoins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-10 11:35:00

During Financial Policy Committee meetings held on April 4 and 8, regulators noted that while the current “interconnectedness of unbacked crypto asset markets with the real economy and financial sector is growing but remains relatively limited,” stablecoins and crypto markets have expanded significantly in the past year, drawing heightened regulatory attention. The UK, its central bank and its local regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority, have been developing frameworks for stablecoins to ensure financial resilience. The committee claims to have determined the factors that make a stablecoin resilient: “A key determinant of the resilience of stablecoins was the liquidity, credit and market risks of their backing assets, which were in place to ensure that redemptions can be met in a timely manner at par, even in periods of stress.“ The committee raised alarm over the “greater issuance of sterling offshore stablecoins with inappropriate backing assets.” This has implications for UK financial markets and “even with appropriate regulation, greater use of stablecoins denominated in foreign currencies could make some economies vulnerable to currency substitution,” the committee said.

The statement followed reports about growing stablecoin adoption not limited to crypto remittances in emerging markets, especially in Africa. A recent report from Chainalysis found that stablecoins now make up nearly half of all transaction volume in Sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, a late 2024 report suggested that a number of emerging economies across Africa have the potential to become digital asset hubs. Ben Caselin, chief marketing officer of Johannesburg-based crypto exchange VALR, told Cointelegraph at the time: “South Africa is the entryway to the rest of Africa with a good rule of law and independent judiciary. It’s easy to open a company in South Africa.” Still, reports of similar trends in developed economies with easily accessible financial infrastructure are scarce. Experts often point to the unavailability of banking services and unstable local fiat currencies as the reason why developing countries — from Africa in particular — are eager to adopt dollar-based stablecoins and crypto .

UK is not alone in worrying The United Kingdom is in good company in worrying about the impact of stablecoins and the broader crypto industry on monetary stability. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) recently warned that crypto will increasingly threaten traditional financial markets’ stability as the industry grows and becomes more entwined with conventional finance players. ESMA’s executive director, Natasha Cazenave said: “We cannot rule out that future sharp drops in crypto prices could have knock-on effects on our financial system.” Local regulators are already acting on those concerns. In late March, the European Union’s insurance authority proposed a blanket rule that would mandate insurance firms to maintain capital equal to the value of their crypto holdings as part of a measure to mitigate risks for policyholders.

This assertion is centered around XRP’s use case in central bank digital currency (CBDC) settlement and its integral role as a bridge asset for value transfer. In the video clip featured in the tweet, Schwartz responds directly to a long-standing question regarding whether XRP could differ in value between public and private ledgers. According to him, it will not. Schwartz explains that the core value proposition of XRP is its access to global liquidity pools , a characteristic that inherently discourages isolated pricing or valuation between different environments. The public #XRP ledger will have the same value as the private ledger. Central Banks will use CBDCs on the private XRP ledger to bridge value from A to B by using the bridge currency ""XRP""! "" $XRP can't be dirt cheap."" pic.twitter.com/2BvB0PD1mn — RipplePumpkin (@RipplePumpkin) April 7, 2025 He references a period of price disparity known as the “kimchi premium” to illustrate that such inconsistencies in value typically arise from structural barriers, such as capital controls, rather than legitimate market forces. He adds that friction or regulatory hurdles may momentarily create price disparities, but such situations generally signify inefficiency, which the market tends to correct. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unified Value Seen as Essential for Global Liquidity The tweet caption directly claims: “The public XRP ledger will have the same value as the private ledger. Central Banks will use CBDCs on the private XRP ledger to bridge value from A to B using the bridge currency ‘XRP’! ‘XRP can’t be dirt cheap.’” RipplePumpkin projects a price increase for XRP once central banks utilize it as a bridge asset on the private ledger. This perspective ties back to Schwartz’s argument about interoperability and frictionless liquidity as core to XRP’s function, reinforcing that price parity is a natural outcome. The public/private ledger discussion has increasingly become central to XRP’s narrative as various national and international financial institutions explore blockchain-based settlement solutions. RipplePumpkin’s post reaffirms that XRP’s utility and liquidity structure make it incompatible with the idea of fragmented valuation. With David Schwartz’s remarks and RipplePumpkin’s agreement, the message is clear: XRP’s value is expected to remain unified across different ledger types, especially as real-world utility through central bank infrastructure begins to take shape.

While this level is expected to hold, a breakdown could trigger another cascade toward $1K. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH’s strong bearish momentum has temporarily paused at the crucial $1.5K support zone, aligning with a major swing low from November 2024. This region serves as a key psychological support level, likely filled with demand, making it a potential pivot point for the price. Recently, Ethereum experienced an uptick in buying pressure, leading to a temporary rebound. However, with selling pressure still dominant, another downward move to test the $1.5K threshold remains likely in the mid-term, increasing the risk of heightened volatility. If this support fails, a sharp decline toward the $1.1K region will be the most probable scenario. The 4-Hour Chart Ethereum continues to trend within a well-defined bearish price channel, forming lower highs and lower lows, reinforcing sellers’ control over the market. The price recently bounced from the channel’s lower boundary, showing a temporary bullish reaction. Given the current market structure, Ethereum is likely to consolidate within this channel, with increasing volatility in the mid-term. If a bullish retracement occurs, the $1.8K resistance level will be the key target in the short term. However, failure to gain momentum could lead to further downside movement. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Analyzing the futures market sentiment has consistently provided valuable insights into price trends, with funding rates being one of the most crucial metrics. This indicator reflects whether buyers or sellers dominate the futures market, offering a clear view of market positioning. As shown in the chart, funding rates have been declining over the past few weeks, signaling that sellers have been aggressively opening leveraged short positions. However, a slight shift has occurred recently, an uptick in buying activity near the critical $1.5K support level has led to a rebound in both price and funding rates. If this trend persists, Ethereum could establish a solid reversal, targeting higher price levels. Conversely, if selling pressure regains dominance, the $1.5K support may break, triggering a deeper decline toward lower levels. Therefore, the coming weeks will be pivotal in determining Ethereum’s next major move.

Emerging Bitcoin Layer 2s like Bitlayer are making significant efforts to introduce Ethereum-like capabilities to the Bitcoin network. Despite being the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin has struggled to scale in proportion to its vast volume and potential. Nearly 99% of all Bitcoin remains idle in users’ wallets. Unlocking that value and making Bitcoin useful for real-world applications won’t be a simple task. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been actively developing Layer 2 scaling solutions for several years, giving it a considerable head start. This early momentum has fostered a vibrant ecosystem—rich with innovations, hard-earned lessons, and cautionary tales that Bitcoin Layer 2s can learn from. That’s the focus of this PowerTalk with Bitlayer Co-Founder Kevin He, who shares key takeaways for builders aiming to scale Bitcoin effectively. When architecting Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, critical lessons can be drawn from Ethereum’s Layer 2 evolution. ​Notably, prior to founding Bitlayer, Kevin served as the Vice President of Technology at New Huo Tech, Senior Technical Director at Huobi, and Chief Scientist at YOUChain. Bitcoin Layer 2 Must Focus on Onchain verification From Stacks and Rootstock to newer entrants like Bitlayer and Botanix, Bitcoin Layer 2 networks are growing rapidly. These Bitcoin Layer2 are making efforts to bring programmability and throughput to the world’s oldest and most trusted blockchain – Bitcoin. But in their ambition to extend Bitcoin’s utility, these protocols face a critical question: What can they learn from Ethereum’s Layer 2 evolution? The answer may determine whether Bitcoin’s second layer becomes a meaningful ecosystem — or a fragmented maze of half-baked solutions. Bitlayer Cofounder Kevin explains the lessons: First, rollups remain a pragmatic and widely accepted scaling approach, as they strike a balance between scalability and security by inheriting Bitcoin’s trust assumptions. However, Bitcoin Layer 2s must prioritize onchain verification/validation capabilities as their foundation. This ensures proofs or fraud disputes can be settled directly on Bitcoin’s base chain without relying on off-chain actors or third-party systems—preserving decentralization and trust-minimized. Notably, the growing pro-crypto conditions – marked by the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and deeper integration with traditional institutional players—has brought renewed confidence to Bitcoin. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s price has increased by approximately 18%, briefly surpassing the $100,000 mark in December 2024. As of today, it is trading around $81,575, recovering as Trump Tariffs take pause. Second, while data availability (DA) is vital for rollup functionality, Bitcoin’s ecosystem should adopt adaptable solutions rather than one-size-fits-all standards. Bitcoin’s community-driven nature naturally encourages experimentation here. By treating DA as a flexible component rather than a rigid protocol requirement, Bitcoin Layer 2s can cater to diverse needs while aligning with the chain’s minimalist ethos. In short, Bitcoin Layer 2s should anchor on trust-minimized onchain verification first, then embrace modularity for DA. This avoids over-engineering pitfalls while upholding Bitcoin’s core strengths: decentralized, secure, and censorship-resistant settlement. Recently, Rootstock, one of the oldest projects aiming to accelerate Bitcoin DeFi, also announced its plan to release Software Development Kit (SDK) for allowing more developers to build own Bitcoin Layer2. Bitcoin didn’t need to change. It needed a layer to grow on. — Rootstock (@rootstock_io) April 9, 2025 User Experience Is Everything Ethereum L2s — Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and others — learned early that users won’t adopt new tech just because it’s faster or cheaper. Users need frictionless UX. They have already set high standards in UX with Fast transactions, Bridge dashboards, Wallet-native interfaces. Thus, Bitcoin L2s can’t afford to fall behind — they need to meet or beat this level of polish. Kevin highlights the ways to achieve this: Bitcoin Layer 2s should balance UX enhancements and protocol purity by adopting a layered architecture. The whole architecture includes Layer 1, Layer 2, and Unified UX Layer (e.g., Account Abstraction). Maybe you are addressing the issue of Layer 2 UX fragmentation. For this question, interoperability is inevitable, and it’s the future direction of blockchains, as no single chain fulfills all needs. Bitcoin’s L2s should embrace this multichain future but avoid forcing protocol changes for UX convenience. Instead, UX should evolve independently through tools like universal wallets or atomic swaps, enabling users to interact with diverse L2s (or even cross-chain assets) through a single interface—mirroring how people manage multiple bank accounts via unified apps. The future isn’t about choosing between decentralization and convenience. After all, most people have multiple bank accounts, but we can also enjoy unified UX akin to Paypal/Alipay. Notably since 2021, the ecosystem of Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) solutions has expanded significantly, with the number of active projects rising from just 10 to 75—a more than sevenfold increase. According to Galaxy forecasts, by 2030, more than $47 billion worth of BTC could be transitioned onto Layer 2 networks. Is Bitcoin DeFi The Future? A recently published report from Binance Research says that over the past year, Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) has become one of the fastest-growing sectors. With the growing opportunities of using BTC in dApps, it is now among the top three DeFi ecosystems with current TVL at US$8.6B. Kevin says, “Bitcoin Layer 2s can catalyze a liquidity flywheel, but with a distinct driver: migrating value from offchain (e.g., centralized exchanges, custodial services) to onchain Bitcoin-native ecosystems, rather than redistributing existing onchain liquidity like Ethereum. The key catalyst will be infrastructure enabling fully onchain Bitcoin DeFi, combining three elements: BitVM bridge, High-Performance L2s, and Native Yield Opportunities. The BitVM Bridge is developed and maintained by Bitlayer. It serves as a trust-minimized protocol designed to securely bridge Bitcoin to various blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. This bridge enables the integration of Bitcoin’s liquidity into decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and was recently the centre of Bitlayer’s partnership with key players, viz., Arbitrum, Statknet, Base, SonicSVM and Plume Network. BTCFi Increasing TVL | Source: Binance Research The flywheel would start with users migrating BTC from custodial platforms to L2s for DeFi access, attracting developers to build onchain tools, which in turn draw more liquidity. That’s the key reason why we develop BitVM Bridge, facilitating the secure migration of Bitcoin into the Bitlayer ecosystem, enabling it to be seamlessly integrated into BTCFi, a rapidly expanding decentralized financial infrastructure for Bitcoin. Final Lesson for Developing Bitcoin Layer 2s Thus, there are many lessons that Bitcoin L2s can learn from Ethereum’s security incidents in the L2 space (e.g., bridge hacks, smart contract bugs) but one final lesson according to Kevin is: Bitcoin’s greatest advantage is its community’s security-first mindset. Bitcoin Layer 2s can avoid Ethereum’s security pitfalls by adopting a more proactive, Bitcoin-native defense mechanism—prioritizing robustness over feature velocity.

According to an analysis by CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin reserve on Binance increased by 22,106 BTC, rising from 568,768 BTC on March 28 to 590,874 BTC on April 9. Binance Reserve Jumps CryptoQuant analyst speculated that the influx of Bitcoin into Binance could be linked to investor caution ahead of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is due to be released on April 10. The uncertainty surrounding US economic indicators, coupled with President Donald Trump’s tariff adjustments, has added to the volatility. Some analysts view the large inflows as a precursor to a possible sell-off, with investors preparing for potential price fluctuations. However, as market participants wait for clearer economic data, the situation remains fluid. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies gained ground on Thursday following Trump’s announcement that he would postpone some tariffs on several countries, excluding China. In a Truth Social post, he announced delaying tariffs for 90 days and slashing reciprocal tariffs to 10% for most countries while simultaneously increasing tariffs on China to 125%, effective right away.

Bitcoin also surged by almost 6% over the past 24 hours, briefly surging above $83,000. According to pseudonymous crypto trader Ash Crypto’s latest analysis , despite the latest uptrend, there are multiple points that could challenge Bitcoin’s upward momentum. The 50-day moving average stands at $85,826, while the 200-day moving average sits just above at $87,000. Additionally, the most recent lower high was recorded at $88,765, adding further pressure to the price as it approaches these levels. On the downside, Bitcoin has established a support level at $81,000, which will likely serve as a cushion if prices begin to pull back. As the crypto navigates these resistance zones, all eyes will be on the CPI, with a forecasted increase of 2.6%. The CPI data could significantly influence market sentiment and either propel Bitcoin past these resistance levels or trigger a consolidation phase, depending on the broader economic context.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is attempting a rebound, trading near $0.00001192 on Thursday, marking a 9% gain in the past 24 hours. After briefly touching a daily high of $0.00001213, SHIB now approaches a key resistance zone near the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.00001228.

As a positive for holders, SHIB managed to defend the $0.0000105–$0.0000110 support range over the past few days. This zone has acted as both a structural and psychological floor multiple times since March. The successful defense of this level, coupled with a 26% spike in trading volume, suggests that “bottom-buyers” might be stepping in, accumulating the token despite broader market uncertainty, as seen on the chart below.

Hougan says in a new interview with Scott Melker that BTC is the “canary in the coal mine” and has been leading the market for the past 4-5 months. “It’s the first thing that people push the button on, and even then it didn’t sell down past the previous all-time highs, so I consider it a huge win. And I think the net effect of the tariff tantrum is we’re going to see weaker fiat currencies around the world, which is a net positive for Bitcoin. So I think long-term, I think it’s ready to move substantially higher if we get sustained stability for a while. I don’t know if we will, but when we get sustained stability, I think this thing rips.” Bitcoin is trading at $78,146 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 1% in the past 24 hours but down more than 9% in the past week.

Defining specific requirements, such as which cryptocurrencies to track and the desired data points, is essential for building an effective portfolio tracker tailored to your investment goals. By combining ChatGPT with real-time crypto data from APIs like CoinMarketCap, you can generate valuable market commentary and analysis, providing deeper insights into your portfolio performance.Developing additional features like price alerts, performance analysis and a user-friendly interface can make your tracker more functional, helping you stay ahead of market trends and manage your crypto investments more effectively. If you’re a cryptocurrency investor, you’ve clearly got a strong appetite for risk! Cryptocurrency portfolios involve many immersive stages, from desktop research on the profitability of cryptocurrencies to actively trading crypto to monitoring regulations. Managing a portfolio of cryptocurrencies can be complex and time-consuming, even for savvy investors. Conversely, if you’re a newbie in the world of cryptocurrencies and want to set yourself up for success, you may be put off by the complexity of it all. The good news is that artificial intelligence (AI) offers valuable tools for the crypto industry, helping you simplify portfolio tracking and analysis when applied effectively. As an experienced crypto investor, this can help free up your valuable time to focus on other activities in your investment lifecycle. If you’re a new investor, AI can help you take that all-important first step. Read on to see how AI, and specifically, ChatGPT, can help you build a customized portfolio tracker. To begin with, what is it? Let’s find out. What is ChatGPT? ChatGPT is a conversational AI model that can deliver various tasks using user-defined prompts — including data retrieval, analysis and visualizations. The GPT stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” which references the fact that it is a large language model extensively trained on copious amounts of text from diverse sources across the internet and designed to understand context and deliver actionable results for end-users. The intelligence of ChatGPT makes it a powerful resource for building a crypto portfolio tracker specifically geared toward your investment profile and objectives. Let’s learn how to build a custom portfolio tracker with ChatGPT. Step 1: Define your requirements Technical specifics notwithstanding, it is crucial to first define what you expect from your crypto portfolio tracker. For example, consider the following questions: What cryptocurrencies will you track? What is your investment approach? Are you looking to actively day trade cryptocurrencies or are you looking to “buy and hold” them for the long term? What are the data points you need to compile for the tracker? These may include but are not limited to price, market cap, volume and even news summaries from the web that could materially alter your investment decisions. What exactly do you need the tracker to deliver for you? Real-time updates? Periodic summaries? Perhaps a combination of both? What do you want the output to look like? Alerts, performance analysis, historical data or something else? Once you have a clear understanding of your requirements, you can move on to the next steps . It is best practice to write down your requirements in a consolidated specifications document so you can keep refining them later if required. Step 2: Set up a ChatGPT instance This is the fun bit! Well, it is if you enjoy geeking out on code. Remember that ChatGPT is a large language model with a vast amount of intelligence sitting underneath it. Using ChatGPT effectively therefore requires you to be able to access the underlying model, which you can do via an Application Program Interface, or API. The company that owns ChatGPT — OpenAI — provides API access to the tool you can utilize to build your tracker. It’s simpler than you might think. You can use a basic three-step process to set up your own ChatGPT instance: Navigate to OpenAI and sign up for an API key. Set up an environment to make API calls. Python is an ideal choice for this, but there are alternatives, such as Node.js. Write a basic script to communicate with ChatGPT using the API key. Here’s a Pythonic script that you may find useful for incorporating OpenAI capabilities into Python. (Note that this is only intended as a representative example to explain OpenAI integration and not to be viewed as financial advice.) Step 3: Integrate a cryptocurrency data source With your ChatGPT instance set up, it is time to complete the other part of the puzzle, namely, your cryptocurrency data source. There are many places to look, and several APIs can help with the information required for this step. Examples include CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap and CryptoCompare. Do your research on these options and choose one that fits your requirements. Once you’ve made your choice, choose one that fits your requirements and integrate it with the ChatGPT instance you spun up as part of Step 2. For example, if you decide to use the CoinMarketCap API, the following code will get you the latest price of Bitcoin, which you may be trading as part of your crypto portfolio. Step 4: Combine ChatGPT and crypto data You’ve done the hard bit, and given that you now have both an AI capability (ChatGPT) and a cryptocurrency data source (CoinMarketCap in this example), you are ready to build a crypto portfolio tracker. To do this, you can leverage prompt engineering to tap into ChatGPT’s intelligence to request data and generate insights. For example, if you want your tracker to return a summary of cryptocurrency prices at a desired time, summarized in a data frame for visualization, consider writing the following code: ==================================================================== ```python # Set your OpenAI API key client = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key) messages = [ {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are an expert market analyst with expertise in cryptocurrency trends.""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": f""Given that the current price of {symbol} is ${price:.2f} as of {date}, provide a concise commentary on the market status, including a recommendation.""} ] try: response = client.chat.completions.create( model=""gpt-4o-mini"", messages=messages, max_tokens=100, temperature=0.7 ) commentary = response.choices[0].message.content return commentary except Exception as e: print(f""Error obtaining commentary for {symbol}: {e}"") return ""No commentary available."" def build_crypto_dataframe(cmc_api_key: str, openai_api_key: str, symbols: list, convert: str = ""USD"") -> pd.DataFrame: records = [] # Capture the current datetime once for consistency across all queries. current_timestamp = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"") for symbol in symbols: price = get_crypto_price(cmc_api_key, symbol, convert) if price is None: commentary = ""No commentary available due to error retrieving price."" else: commentary = get_openai_commentary(openai_api_key, symbol, price, current_timestamp) records.append({ ""Symbol"": symbol, ""Price"": price, ""Date"": current_timestamp, ""Market Commentary"": commentary }) df = pd.DataFrame(records) return df # Example usage: if __name__ == '__main__': # Replace with your actual API keys. cmc_api_key = ‘YOUR_API_KEY’ openai_api_key = ‘YOUR_API_KEY’ # Specify the cryptocurrencies of interest. crypto_symbols = [""BTC"", ""ETH"", ""XRP""] # Build the data frame containing price and commentary. crypto_df = build_crypto_dataframe(cmc_api_key, openai_api_key, crypto_symbols) # Print the resulting dataframe. print(crypto_df) ``` ==================================================================== The above piece of code takes three cryptocurrencies in your portfolio — Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ) and XRP ( XRP ), and uses the ChatGPT API to get the current price in the market as seen in the CoinMarketCap data source. It organizes the results in a table with AI-generated market commentary, providing a straightforward way to monitor your portfolio and assess market conditions. Step 5: Develop additional features You can now enhance your tracker by adding more functionality or including appealing visualizations. For example, consider: Alerts: Set up email or SMS alerts for significant price changes. Performance analysis: Track portfolio performance over time and provide insights. Visualizations: Integrate historical data to visualize trends in prices. For the savvy investor, this can help identify the next major market shift. Step 6: Create a user interface To make your crypto portfolio tracker user-friendly, it’s advisable to develop a web or mobile interface. Again, Python frameworks like Flask, Streamlit or Django can help spin up simple but intuitive web applications, with alternatives such as React Native or Flutter helping with mobile apps. Regardless of choice, simplicity is key. Did you know? Flask offers lightweight flexibility, Streamlit simplifies data visualization and Django provides robust, secure backends. All are handy for building tools to track prices and market trends! Step 7: Test and deploy Make sure that you thoroughly test your tracker to ensure accuracy and reliability. Once tested, deploy it to a server or cloud platform like AWS or Heroku. Monitor the usefulness of the tracker over time and tweak the features as desired. The integration of AI with cryptocurrencies can help track your portfolio. It lets you build a customized tracker with market insights to manage your crypto holdings. However, consider risks : AI predictions may be inaccurate, API data can lag and over-reliance might skew decisions. Proceed cautiously.

SOL’s sharp correction is attributed to the latest round of tariffs from the Trump administration and its potential to erase trillions of dollars from the stock market. Experts claim that the Solana price could go as low as the $80 mark if the bearish trend continues. Analysts focus on IntelMarkets in this turbulence due to INTL’s constant success. The ICO has become a disruptive force in this bull run as its presale soars above the $12.2 level. Trump Tariffs Rattle Solana Price: SOL Down By 6% Following US President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2, Solana's price dropped significantly. Solana's price trajectory has made it a risky investment. Investors are shifting their focus from riskier assets, like SOL, to safer investments as a result of the rise of trade tensions. A steep reduction in the annualized rolling basis on three-month contracts indicates that the recent Solana price decline is strongly related to diminishing demand in the futures market. As an annual percentage, the annualized rolling basis indicates how much more (or less) futures contracts are trading with the current spot price. A high basis means futures are trading at a significant premium, signaling bullish expectations and strong demand for leveraged long positions. On the other hand, a low or negative basis means futures are trading close to or below the spot price, indicating a lack of speculative interest or growing bearish sentiment. SOL futures basis peaked in mid-November 2024 at 18% and was below 0% as of April 3, showing that traders are no longer paying a premium for SOL. The SOL token is plummeting in this bull run, registering an intraday decline of over 4%. Bears have a complete hold over the SOL market actions. Experts claim that the Solana price declines can result in the SOL token reaching the $80 mark. The dominance of a huge red candle over the daily charts shows the bearish control over Solana.

The rollercoaster of the crypto market might be gearing up for another breathtaking climb. Cardano’s very own founder, Charles Hoskinson, has dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending ripples of excitement (and maybe a little disbelief) across the digital asset sphere. Hold onto your hats, because he’s talking about Bitcoin potentially hitting a staggering $250,000 by late 2024 or 2025! Let’s dive deep into the factors fueling this audacious forecast and explore what it could mean for the future of crypto. Why is Charles Hoskinson So Bullish on Bitcoin’s Future? In a recent interview with CNBC, Charles Hoskinson, a prominent figure in the blockchain world and the mind behind Cardano, laid out his compelling vision for Bitcoin’s trajectory. It’s not just wishful thinking; Hoskinson backs his Bitcoin price prediction with a confluence of powerful factors he believes are set to converge and propel Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. Let’s break down the key drivers he highlighted: Explosive Crypto Adoption: Hoskinson points to the continued and accelerating rate of crypto adoption globally. As more individuals, institutions, and even nations embrace digital currencies, the demand for Bitcoin, the king of crypto, naturally increases. This growing mainstream acceptance is laying a stronger foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term growth. Geopolitical Instability: In times of global uncertainty, investors often seek safe-haven assets. Hoskinson argues that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a digital gold, a hedge against traditional market volatility and geopolitical turmoil. As the world grapples with ongoing tensions and economic shifts, Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized and borderless asset strengthens. Impending Stablecoin Regulations: While regulations might sound like a hurdle, Hoskinson sees the upcoming stablecoin regulations as a catalyst for maturity and stability in the crypto space. Clearer rules of the game can attract more institutional investors who have been hesitant due to regulatory ambiguity. This influx of capital could significantly boost the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin. Tech Giants Entering the Arena: Imagine tech behemoths like Apple and Microsoft stepping into the crypto ring. Hoskinson believes this is not just a possibility, but a growing likelihood. The entry of such established and influential players would bring immense credibility, infrastructure, and user base to the crypto ecosystem, further accelerating crypto adoption and legitimizing Bitcoin. Navigating the Current Market Downturn: A Temporary Setback? The crypto market is known for its volatility, and recent times have been no exception. Concerns over U.S. tariff tensions have contributed to a market downturn, leaving some investors feeling uneasy. However, Hoskinson views this as a temporary phase. He believes that these market fluctuations are part and parcel of the crypto journey and that the underlying bullish factors remain strong. He emphasizes that once the Federal Reserve (Fed) begins to cut interest rates, the market is likely to stabilize and potentially rebound. Think of it like this: the current dip could be a pit stop on the way to a much grander destination. Smart investors might even see this as an opportune moment to accumulate Bitcoin before the anticipated surge. It’s all about perspective and understanding the long-term vision. Is a $250K Bitcoin Price Realistic? Examining the Crypto Market Outlook Predicting the future, especially in the volatile world of crypto, is no easy feat. While Hoskinson’s Bitcoin price prediction is certainly bold, it’s crucial to consider the broader crypto market outlook and analyze the factors that could influence Bitcoin’s journey to $250,000. Let’s weigh the potential tailwinds and headwinds: Factors Favoring $250K Bitcoin Potential Challenges Continued growth in crypto adoption across retail and institutional sectors. Regulatory hurdles or unfavorable government policies in major economies. Increasing use of Bitcoin as a store of value amidst global economic uncertainties. Unexpected black swan events or major economic recessions impacting all markets. Positive impact of clearer stablecoin regulations and institutional on-ramps. Technological disruptions or the emergence of a significantly superior cryptocurrency. Potential entry of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft into the crypto space. Sustained high inflation and interest rates delaying market recovery. As you can see, the path to $250,000 Bitcoin isn’t without its potential bumps. However, the confluence of positive factors that Hoskinson and many others are pointing to paints a compelling picture of significant upside potential. The key takeaway is that the crypto landscape is dynamic, and staying informed and adaptable is crucial. Charles Hoskinson’s Vision: What Does It Mean for You? Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or just dipping your toes into the digital asset waters, Charles Hoskinson’s Bitcoin price prediction offers a valuable perspective. It highlights the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in crypto adoption , regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends. Knowledge is power in the crypto world. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t solely rely on predictions, even from prominent figures. Conduct thorough research on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to make informed investment decisions. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments are often best viewed with a long-term horizon. Volatility is inherent, but the potential for significant growth remains substantial. Manage Risk Wisely: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification and risk management are essential components of any sound investment strategy. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Bitcoin Charles Hoskinson’s bold Bitcoin price prediction of $250,000 is undoubtedly captivating. While the future remains uncertain, his analysis underscores the powerful forces that could drive Bitcoin’s value upwards. From increasing crypto adoption to geopolitical factors and potential institutional involvement, the stage seems set for an exciting chapter in Bitcoin’s journey. Whether or not Bitcoin reaches $250,000 by 2025 remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the crypto revolution is far from over, and Bitcoin is likely to remain at the forefront of this transformative wave.

The SHIB managed to move over 5% up between Monday and Tuesday. However, the Shiba Inu price was unable to sustain the momentum and dropped again. Investors are feeling the burn of the Shiba Inu price drop as its losses over the past month now mount up to over 12%, the bulk of which occurred during the first week of April as the macroeconomic shocks proved to be too much for the SHIB token. Despite multiple efforts undertaken by the SHIB community to sustain the Shiba Inu price, the overall bearish sentiments in the markets were an overriding factor that impacted all actively listed tokens. Many SHIB investors have now picked up new crypto projects. The most popular pick for investors impacted by the Shiba Inu price drop is the IntelMarkets (INTL) ICO. This AI project is hugely popular for its strong AI-based trading tools. INTL tokens are available for just $0.09, making them a great option for SHIB investors. IntelMarkets (INTL) Offers 400% Gains At Launch IntelMarkets is an AI-powered trading platform. It is unique from all the other trading platforms because it offers AI-supported tools and assessment modules that allow retail and institutional traders to make better and quicker trades. The platform has a data analysis feature known as the Intell-Array Multichannel Analysis. This helps users to analyze large data volumes from the markets and easily pick out the best trading opportunities in the market. Its trading robots are automated and self-learning and eliminate the need for human intervention in making trading decisions. These trading robots are the true USP of the platform. They analyze market data and suggest profitable trading strategies. The platform collects data from over 350,000 points to generate clear trade signals for profitable trades. IntelMarkets (INTL) has already gathered over $12.2 million in funding, has seed funding from Fortune 500 investors, and is moving in the right direction as it captures the attention of the crypto-trading community. Given its post-launch potential, IntelMarkets is set to outperform prominent altcoins like SHIB to exciting new extremes. SHIB Community Support Unable To Push Shiba Inu Price Into Green Zone The Shiba Inu price was unable to beat the overall market sentiment despite strong support from the SHIB community. The Shiba Inu price dropped by almost 2.5% over the past 24 hours despite strong support. There was a recovery of over 10% as the Shiba Inu price moved up from the $0.000010 lowest point. The current Shiba Inu price is around $0.000011, which is acting as a key support range for now. The SHIB community sentiment is still bullish, and trading experts foresee a recovery to the $0.000012 price range. However, the market volume is down by almost 24% to $282 million, which seems to indicate that SHIB holders are waiting for the strong bear trend to subside before they venture into trading. Market experts forecast that the markets will stabilize by the weekend, and the Shiba Inu price will start to move in a bullish pattern as some normalcy returns to the market. Conclusion Everything discussed above points toward IntelMarkets (INTL) being the future of crypto trading. The AI-powered trading platform is set to offer profitability that will be on par with the Shiba Inu price performance and compete against other established players, the same as the INTL token. The new AI coin might become a strong contender against top altcoins, hailed by experts as the best new crypto to invest in.

43168187,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=708026,1744286492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43168187.jpeg,China starts dumping US Treasuries as trade war keeps escalating,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-starts-dumping-us-treasuries/,"China might have begun dumping US Treasuries after announcing 84% tariffs on American goods this week, triggering a fresh hit to global markets on Wednesday. The decision escalates tensions with Washington as President Xi Jinping ramps up economic pressure in response to the renewed trade war led by Donald Trump’s administration. Duncan Wrigley, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said, “Beijing saw the way things are going and thought this might well be the opportune moment to apply more critical pressure on the US.” Trump’s tariffs were labeled “economic bullying” by China’s foreign ministry. Now, Beijing is hitting back through debt markets. China triggers economic shock by unloading US bonds As of January, China held $761 billion in US Treasuries, making it the second-largest holder of American government debt, behind only Japan. The number is official, but Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, estimated that the actual total is closer to $1 trillion once hidden holdings through European custody accounts are included. By offloading this debt, China directly pressures US borrowing costs. Selling Treasuries forces yields to rise, which drives up interest the US government must pay to fund itself. It’s a costly hit, one that risks destabilizing financial markets. If Beijing sells too aggressively, the value of the remaining debt it holds drops too, and that turns this into a boomerang. Interestingly, Marcello Estevão, chief economist at the Institute for International Finance, warned the sale would be dangerous for Beijing too. “It would be self-defeating because it would very much hurt China,” he said . That’s because China’s central government and state-owned banks are loaded with dollar assets—roughly $3 trillion, according to Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. “That’s roughly the value of UK GDP,” Williams said. Trying to get rid of that much debt too fast would backfire hard. Williams compared the tactic to “lobbing a hand grenade at someone sitting across from you in a room.” That’s how close the financial interdependence is. Trump would take the hit, but Xi would catch shrapnel too. Selling Treasuries in bulk would also hammer the dollar. That means the rest of China’s massive dollar holdings would lose value instantly. It’s a lose-lose situation. And there’s nowhere useful to park the money either. Williams said if Beijing repatriates the dollars, the renminbi would surge in value. That would make Chinese exports more expensive and screw up China’s trade position. Robin Brooks said the worst-case scenario would spark panic in the Treasury market. “If China announces they’re going to sell their treasury holdings, for sure, yields in the market would spike. It would be a huge shock,” Brooks said. But the US Federal Reserve wouldn’t sit still. Brooks said the Fed would immediately launch a large-scale quantitative easing program to force yields back down. There’s precedent for that. In March 2020, emerging market central banks dumped Treasuries to defend their currencies, and US bond yields jumped from 0.5% to 1.2% in a week. The Fed bought $1.2 trillion in debt to calm things down. If China repeats that scale of dumping now, similar emergency action is expected. But Fed intervention has costs too. If the central bank buys massive amounts of debt to counter China’s move and inflation rises—especially with Trump’s new tariffs in play—the Fed could end up booking major losses on its own balance sheet.

Meanwhile, the Cardano price shows signs of recovery as ADA holders regain confidence amid the broader market sentiment shift. Leading the pack, IntelMarkets (INTL) is at an all-time high, attracting high-profile investors with its fast-growing network. Analyst Claims New Highs For Cardano Price Soon The Cardano price has kicked off the second week of April under heavy scrutiny as it circles back to levels seen over four years ago. ADA opened the week trading above $0.65, but experienced a sharp decline shortly after, touching a low of just under $0.52 on April 7. A slight rebound in the Cardano price followed on April 8 and briefly pushed it to around $0.61. However, the recovery proved to be weak and unsustainable. By April 9, the Cardano price had settled near $0.56, with a 24-hour drop of 2.6%, a 7-day decrease of 15.4%, and a 14-day slump totaling 25.9%. As the market absorbed the latest Cardano price pullback, analyst Jesse Olson shared a chart on ‘X’ to outline ADA’s long-term stagnation. His analysis revealed that ADA returned to February 2021 price levels, exactly 1,519 days later. During this time, the Cardano price saw major surges and sharp corrections. Notably, despite a brief rally in late 2023, ADA has yet to set a new all-time high in the current market cycle. Olson’s visual narrative highlighted that ADA’s current price mirrors the 2021 valuation. Avalanche (AVAX) Down By 4%: More Crash Inbound? Avalanche (AVAX) has lost 4.47% in the last 24 hours following its brief drop below $15 on Monday. This development occurred after the crypto market experienced a slight relief from the weekend correction. Despite the rebound, it appears that the coast is not yet clear for Avalanche (AVAX), with key resistance levels likely stopping the increase. In this analysis, experts explained why sustaining recent gains in Avalanche (AVAX) could be difficult. One metric that raises concerns about the Avalanche (AVAX) price holding its upward momentum is the ‘Bulls and Bears’ indicator. This metric tracks the number of addresses responsible for at least 1% of the total volume, outlining major buy and sell activity. Typically, when bulls outnumber bears, it signals strong buying pressure. However, data from IntoTheBlock shows that bearish addresses are currently dominant. As a result, the selling pressure could stop Avalanche (AVAX) from showing an extended rally in the short term. Besides that, the In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator also aligns with the outlook. IntelMarkets’ Viral ICO Token Competes Against ADA & AVAX IntelMarkets (INTL) has disrupted the trillion-dollar crypto market as the viral ICO token that has outperformed Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) with its mind-blowing presale collection. With its cutting-edge layer-1 blockchain, IntelMarkets has turned heads and attracted the investor community to its state-of-the-art dual-chain platform. The platform has raised eyebrows with its jaw-dropping numbers on the presale chart that portray IntelMarkets as a strong contender in the crypto market. On the other hand, the prolonged selling pressure in Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) is also pushing away investors to explore new avenues for growth and investment recovery. Senior Analyst Lists IntelMarkets Among The Best Altcoins In 2025 With its fast-growing spotlight making wonders in the crypto market, IntelMarkets (INTL) has been in the spotlight against Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) for quite a while now. Observing this growing optimism for IntelMarkets, a senior analyst listed INTL among the best altcoins to watch in 2025. While its insane AI technology is already gaining traction for revolutionizing crypto trading with mind-boggling tools and product suites, the growing demand among institutional investors is also positioned to skyrocket IntelMarkets to new highs.

The National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) introduced the draft framework on April 8, aiming to help lawmakers build a comprehensive crypto tax structure that aligns with international standards while addressing the country’s unique financial needs. According to the proposal, crypto-to-fiat conversions and payments made using crypto would attract an 18% income tax, accompanied by a 5% military levy. Crypto-to-crypto transactions, however, would remain untaxed—a decision designed to mirror the approaches taken in crypto-forward jurisdictions like Austria, France, and Singapore. NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Magomedov stressed the urgency of the initiative, stating that “the issue of crypto taxes is not a hypothesis, but a reality that is fast approaching.” He emphasized the importance of crafting thoughtful, context-sensitive legislation that weighs the pros and cons of each policy choice before it makes its way into law. Low-Impact Users Get Breathing Room in Ukraine One of the more progressive aspects of the NSSMC’s plan is its treatment of stablecoins. Since Ukraine’s tax code already excludes income from foreign currency transactions, the regulator suggests that stablecoins—often pegged to foreign fiat—either be fully exempt or subject to a much lower tax rate, ranging from 5% to 9%. In an apparent bid to support retail adoption and minimize overregulation, the draft also proposes exemptions and thresholds. Transfers between family members, crypto held for a long duration, and small-scale activities could be exempted or taxed at a reduced rate . These provisions aim to reduce compliance burdens on casual users while maintaining oversight over significant market participants. Mining, Airdrops, and Staking Addressed Separately Beyond regular transactions, the framework also tackles the taxation of other crypto-related activities such as mining, staking, and token distributions via airdrops and hard forks. While crypto mining is largely treated as a business activity, the NSSMC floated the idea of tax-free thresholds to support independent miners. Staking rewards may be taxed only when converted into fiat, and airdrops could be taxed either as ordinary income or upon liquidation. Notably, the document hints that non-custodial wallets might not qualify for exemptions, though this remains a topic for further discussion. The proposal follows on the heels of a legislative review of a draft bill to legalize cryptocurrencies. Ukraine began laying the legal groundwork for crypto regulation in March 2022, when President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed the country’s first crypto market law into effect.

This respite means that SUI has reversed some of the hefty losses it incurred over previous days, although the altcoin is still down by 7% in a week and by 23% in the past fortnight. Yet with the coin also holding on to an annual return of 37%, and with its 24-hour trading volume spiking to $1.9 billion today, it looks ready to post further recovery gains in the coming days. And when combined with its enviably strong fundamentals, Sui could really make big progress in the coming year , especially if the international trading situation settles further. Is Sui the Next Solana? $1.9 Billion Floods In After Trump’s Surprise Tariff Pause Sui’s chart is now in a very promising place, with its indicators showing signs of a strong recovery, and with its resistance (red) and support (green) levels suggesting that a big move could be coming. Its 30-day average (orange) is arguably close to a bottom in relation to the 200-day (blue), implying that SUI should rebound upwards quite soon. Source: TradingView And given that the coin’s relative strength index (purple) has been below 50 (or lower) since the end of January, it could certainly be on the cusp of strong upwards movement. This will all depend, however, on what happens next in the recently escalating trade war between the US and the rest of the world. While President Donald Trump has seemingly backtracked on blanket tariffs against every other nation, the permanence of any pause depends on negotiations between the US and its various trading partners. It's obvious that China was always the main target of Trump's aggressive trade war. He dropped tariffs on most countries to 10%, while hitting China with crazy tariffs of 125%. This will end all US trade with China.

However, if the US does make its pause on tariffs permanent, and if it and China climb down from their tit-for-tat escalation, then we could see a more sustained market recovery in the coming weeks. SUI will be in a very good position to benefit from such a recovery, with its network now the ninth-biggest in crypto in terms of TVL , at $1.19 billion.

Based on all this, SUI’s price could return to $3 at some point in May, before reaching $4 by H2. New Alts Bring Big-Rally Potential Given SUI’s dependency on wider market conditions, some traders may prefer to look at newer coins that could surge irrespective of the market’s overall mood. This means looking at presale coins, with the biggest and most popular sales often leading to big rallies once the corresponding tokens list for the first time. And one coin with a better-than-average chance of rallying is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has now raised $29.6 million in its sale, making it one of the biggest ICOs of the past year.

Dive into $SOLX to discover a whole new world to explore https://t.co/mdaTX9aVVx pic.twitter.com/rZWcJy2YGF — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) April 9, 2025 What’s proving so attractive about Solaxy is that it’s Solana’s first fully fledged layer-two network. As an L2, Solaxy will provide Solana users with faster transactions and lower fees, while it will also enable instant bridging between itself and its parent network. Its team will add compatibility with other chains over time, making it accessible to a bigger number of traders and developers. And given that SOLX will be necessary to pay transaction fees, the coin will benefit from strong demand, particularly when you can also stake it for a passive income. Investors can still join its sale by going to the Solaxy website , where SOLX is currently selling at $0.00169. This price will rise tomorrow, so traders should act quickly, especially when more price rises are due before the coin lists.

Recent data reveals a concerning trend for XRP, particularly on the South Korean exchange Upbit. A surge in XRP sell pressure indicates a potential shift in investor sentiment and raises questions about the token’s immediate future. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this could mean for XRP and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the XRP Sell Pressure on Upbit: What’s Happening? According to a recent analysis by market expert Dom, South Korean traders on Upbit have been exhibiting increasingly bearish behavior towards XRP. Between April 6th and 7th, a staggering 1.4 million XRP/KRW trades were executed on the platform. What’s truly noteworthy is that a significant 62% of these transactions were sell orders. This overwhelming selling activity points to a growing lack of confidence among Korean investors in XRP’s near-term prospects. Dom’s analysis further reveals that this net selling pressure translates to a substantial $120 million worth of XRP being offloaded within just two days. This considerable outflow suggests more than just minor profit-taking; it hints at a potential shift in market sentiment that could trigger a more prolonged phase of crypto consolidation for XRP. Why is Upbit’s XRP Sell Pressure Significant? Upbit is not just any exchange; it’s a dominant player in the South Korean cryptocurrency market, which often acts as a bellwether for broader crypto trends, especially in Asia. The actions of Korean traders on platforms like Upbit are closely watched as they can sometimes foreshadow wider market movements. Therefore, this concentrated XRP sell pressure on Upbit carries significant weight and warrants attention from the global crypto community. Here’s why the situation on Upbit matters: Market Sentiment Indicator: South Korea is a major crypto market, and Upbit is a leading exchange there. Bearish activity on Upbit can reflect broader Asian market sentiment, influencing global trends. Volume Impact: The sheer volume of XRP sold – $120 million in two days – is substantial. Such a large sell-off can exert considerable downward pressure on XRP’s price. Potential Trendsetter: If Korean traders are losing confidence in XRP, it could signal a shift in sentiment among other investor groups globally, potentially leading to wider sell-offs. Technical Analysis: XRP Price and Potential Consolidation Cointelegraph’s report further delves into the technical aspects of XRP’s price action. A crucial level to watch is the 200-day moving average (DMA). Currently hovering around $1.82, this DMA acts as a significant indicator of long-term trend direction. According to the analysis, if XRP closes a daily candle below this 200-DMA, it could very well signal the beginning of a prolonged consolidation phase . What does ‘consolidation’ mean in this context? It suggests a period where XRP’s price may trade within a defined range, lacking a clear upward or downward trend. This phase is often characterized by: Sideways Price Action: Instead of sharp rallies or drops, expect XRP to move horizontally within a price band. Reduced Volatility: Price swings may become less dramatic as the market seeks a new equilibrium. Accumulation or Distribution: Consolidation phases can be periods of either accumulation (where investors buy at lower prices in anticipation of future gains) or distribution (where larger holders sell off their positions). The analysis points to a key demand zone for XRP lying between $1.63 and $1.27. This zone is anticipated to be where accumulation might occur, meaning buyers could step in at these lower price levels, potentially halting further declines and establishing a base for future price recovery. Key Price Levels to Watch for XRP To better understand the potential trajectory of XRP, keeping an eye on specific price levels is crucial. These levels can act as signposts, indicating whether the XRP price analysis is pointing towards further decline or a possible stabilization. Level Significance Implication 200-day Moving Average (DMA) – ~$1.82 Critical Support/Resistance Closing below suggests potential consolidation. Sustained trading above could negate bearish pressure. Demand Zone – $1.63 – $1.27 Potential Accumulation Zone Price falling into this range might attract buyers, leading to price stabilization or rebound. Immediate Support – (To be determined based on current market data) Short-term price floor Breaching this level could accelerate downward momentum. Immediate Resistance – (To be determined based on current market data) Short-term price ceiling Breaking above this level could alleviate immediate sell pressure. What Does This Mean for XRP Investors and Traders? The rising XRP sell pressure on Upbit and the potential for crypto consolidation present a mixed bag of implications for investors and traders: For Traders: Increased volatility might present short-term trading opportunities. However, caution is advised due to the prevailing bearish sentiment. Monitor price levels closely and use appropriate risk management strategies. For Long-Term Investors: The consolidation phase could be viewed as a period to accumulate XRP at potentially lower prices, especially within the demand zone of $1.63 – $1.27. However, be prepared for a potentially extended period of sideways price action and further downward pressure if the bearish sentiment persists. Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market developments, especially price action around the 200-DMA and within the demand zone. Monitor news and analysis related to XRP and the broader crypto market to make informed decisions. Is Long-Term Crypto Consolidation Inevitable for XRP? While the current XRP sell pressure on Upbit is undoubtedly a cause for concern, it’s important to remember that the crypto market is dynamic and sentiment can shift rapidly. Whether this leads to a long-term crypto consolidation for XRP remains to be seen. Several factors will influence XRP’s future price trajectory, including: Broader Market Sentiment: The overall direction of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, will significantly impact XRP. Ripple’s Developments: Progress in Ripple’s legal battles and adoption of XRP in real-world applications can boost investor confidence. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in crypto regulations globally, particularly in key markets like South Korea and the US, can have a profound impact on XRP and the entire crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the XRP Market Amidst Sell Pressure The current surge in XRP sell pressure on Upbit is a significant signal that investors should heed. While it points towards a potential phase of crypto consolidation for XRP, it also presents opportunities for strategic investors and traders. By understanding the key price levels, monitoring market sentiment, and staying informed about broader market developments, you can navigate this period effectively. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and while bearish signals are emerging for XRP, the situation is still fluid and subject to change. Stay vigilant, do your research, and manage your risk wisely.

US World Food Program Accepts Bitcoin, Dogecoin Donations Amid Funding Crisis The move comes as the organization aims to raise $25 million through its Emergency Hunger Relief Fund to support food aid to the 58 million people facing hunger worldwide. Although WFP USA operates independently of the UN's World Food Programme, it shares its mission to address food insecurity in some of the world's most vulnerable regions. The push to embrace crypto donations comes after severe funding cuts during the Trump administration, which halted U.S. financial support for emergency food aid efforts in 14 countries, including Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. WFP officials have warned that the funding cuts could have devastating consequences, describing them as a potential “death sentence” for millions of people already on the brink of starvation. A Modern Approach to Humanitarian Aid Dorota Amin, WFP USA’s director of philanthropy and partnerships, said the organization is embracing emerging technologies like blockchain and crypto not just out of innovation but necessity. “Traditional aid systems are under great pressure. Embracing new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency is not just a choice, it is a necessity.” The benefits of crypto donations go beyond speed and efficiency. WFP USA noted that blockchain-based payments have lower transaction fees, meaning a greater portion of each donation goes directly to relief efforts. In a related development, the White House confirmed on Wednesday that it plans to provide some funding to the UN World Food Programme, according to Reuters, but US officials said they want the organisation to make changes in certain countries before the full funding is returned. *This is not investment advice.

The AI-powered platform seeks to merge AI and crypto trading together making it one of the top DeFi projects to watch out for. Its price is expected to rise by 10x this year. Ali Martinez Tells Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors To Watch This Key Support The Dogecoin price is under strong bearish pressure as it drops into the red region. CoinMarketCap data indicates the Dogecoin price has plummeted by 16.8% on the weekly timeframe, 14.9% on the monthly level, and 28.9% on the yearly chart. This Dogecoin price downturn comes as investors' interest in memecoins continues to drop. Ali Martinez told his followers in a recent tweet to watch out for the key support level at $0.13. A drop below this level could pull the Dogecoin price to lower lows. In another tweet, Trader Tardigrade notes DOGE has been under the spring of Wyckoff Accumulation. The analyst forecasts the Dogecoin price might surge to $0.21. However, the Dogecoin price must cross the resistance around $0.17-$0.18 to maintain a bullish momentum. In the meantime, the Dogecoin price has been fluctuating between $0.13 and $0.17. Ethereum (ETH) Eyes Bullish Pennant Breakout According to a top analyst called MerlijnTrader, the Ethereum price is trading inside a bullish pennant and is preparing for a breakout. If the breakout is successful, MerlijnTrader forecasts the Ethereum price might rise to $8,000 in the coming months. In a previous tweet, the analyst argued that the Ethereum price was mirroring Bitcoin's trajectory from 2021. He told his followers not to overlook ETH and predicted the Ethereum price might pump to $24,000. In the meantime, the Ethereum price is trading below the $1,500 mark. The cryptocurrency's value has dipped by 23.2% in the weekly timeframe. In addition, the Ethereum price had also plummeted by 28.2% and 60.2% on the monthly and yearly charts. Looking ahead, the Ethereum price has immediate resistance around $1,595 and $1,782. Surpassing them could clear the way to $2,000 or even $3,000 if bullish momentum is high. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI Powerhouse Gaining Momentum As Market Volatility Rises Although analysts have predicted the Ethereum price could surge to $8,000, the bearish sentiment in the market could be a major obstacle. In the meantime, new altcoins like IntelMarkets (INTL) are gaining traction. Currently, IntelMarkets has already raised over $12.2 million and the value of the INTL token has increased by 900% to $0.091. This DeFi project could be the next 10x gem in the market now given its AI features. IntelMarkets offers AI tools to retailers to make trading more profitable. It is based on Intelli-M™, an AI bot system that uses more than 100,000 inputs, including charts and current market indicators, to make automated trading decisions.

Here, users can navigate and use specific AI agents for various strategies, which makes the platform suitable for novices and experts.

The Ethereum price is on the verge of a major breakout while Dogecoin could soar to $0.21 in the coming weeks. On the other hand, IntelMarkets has become the next-gen coin for investors who want to make up to 10x ROI this year. Its low market cap increases its chances for growth, giving it enough room to climb higher.

Higher tariffs result in stagflation— stagnant economic growth coupled with inflation — which is negative for traditional assets, but positive for scarce commodities such as gold, the report said. Bitcoin is considered hard money, akin to digital gold, and is viewed as a modern store of value, the report noted. Cryptocurrencies surged on Wednesday following President Donald Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries that haven't retaliated against the U.S. ""Trade tensions may put pressure on reserve demand for the U.S. Dollar, opening space for competing assets, including other fiat currencies, gold, and bitcoin,"" Grayscale said. Historical precedent suggests that dollar weakness and above-average inflation may persist, and bitcoin is likely to benefit from such a macro backdrop, the asset manager said. ""A rapidly improving market structure, supported by U.S. government policy changes"" could help broaden bitcoin's investor base, the report added.

Bitpanda on April 10 announced receiving a new MiCA license from Austria’s Financial Market Authority (FMA), its third after approvals from regulators in Germany and Malta. Its latest approval marks “another step toward building the most regulated crypto platform in Europe,” the exchange said in an announcement on X. Source: Bitpanda MiCA, which took full effect on Dec. 30, 2024, is designed to provide a harmonized legal framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) across the EU. Despite this goal, Bitpanda’s pursuit of multiple licenses raises questions about how consistently MiCA is being interpreted and enforced across the bloc. Bitpanda’s MiCA collection story Vienna-headquartered Bitpanda was one of the first crypto asset service providers (CASP) to receive a MiCA license after the framework entered into full force on Dec. 30, 2024. Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) was the first regulator to issue a MiCA license for Bitpanda , the firm announced on Jan. 23. According to Bitpanda's announcement on LinkedIn, it subsequently secured another MiCA license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). Related: Malta regulator fines OKX crypto exchange $1.2M for past AML breaches “Following yesterday’s announcement of our first MiCAR license, this second license sends a clear message: Bitpanda is setting the standard as Europe’s most secure and well-regulated crypto platform,” the company wrote. Bitpanda announced receiving a MiCA license from the MFSA in a LinkedIn post. Source: LinkedIn posting date extractor At the time of publication, none of the relevant regulators — Austria’s FMA, Germany’s BaFin, or Malta’s MFSA — maintain publicly available registries showing which firms have received MiCA licenses. Data from Austria’s Financial Market Authority on Bitpanda’s licensing. Source: FMA According to Austria’s FMA records , Bitpanda currently holds four different approvals in Austria and Germany for entities including Bitpanda Asset Management GmbH, Bitpanda Financial Services GmbH, Bitpanda GmbH and Bitpanda Payments GmbH. Does MiCA provide for multiple licenses in EU states? Proposed in 2020, the MiCA framework is designed to set comprehensive regulations for CASPs across the EU, creating “uniform EU market rules for crypto-assets,” according to a key MiCA regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority. Despite MiCA’s aim to harmonize crypto regulation across the EU, Bitpanda’s pursuit of multiple licenses suggests regulatory inconsistencies may still exist among member states. Cointelegraph approached Bitpanda for comment regarding its approach to securing multiple MiCA licenses but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has surged by 9.56% in 24 hours to $1.85. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price, it is up by 11.59% to $2. If the bullish momentum kick starts, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.01. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $1.77. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.00404245 11.93% Market cap $ 116,785,522,610.49 Circulating Supply 58,274,974,538.00 Trading Volume $ 7,259,057,394.1030 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the long-term XRP price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

43168743,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148198,1744287647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Upbit’s Groundbreaking Move: Empowering South Korean Government with Crypto Accounts,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-government-crypto-accounts/,"In a groundbreaking development for the cryptocurrency landscape in South Korea, Upbit, one of the nation’s leading crypto exchanges, has announced a significant policy update. Imagine government agencies like the Prosecution Service and the National Tax Service, organizations typically associated with traditional finance, now engaging directly with the world of digital assets. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario anymore – Upbit is officially enabling these entities, along with local governments, to open accounts for virtual asset transactions. This move signals a potential paradigm shift in how government bodies interact with cryptocurrencies and manage virtual asset transactions . Why is Upbit Enabling Government Accounts? Upbit’s decision to onboard government agencies is a strategic and forward-thinking step. But why is this happening now, and what does it mean for the broader crypto ecosystem? Let’s break down the key reasons: Enhanced Regulatory Compliance: As crypto regulations evolve globally, governments are increasingly focused on oversight and compliance. By providing official accounts, Upbit facilitates a more transparent and regulated environment for government entities to engage with virtual asset transactions . This move can be seen as a proactive measure to align with and support evolving regulatory frameworks in South Korea. Streamlined Law Enforcement: For law enforcement agencies like the Prosecution Service, having direct access to crypto exchange accounts simplifies investigations related to financial crimes involving digital assets. It streamlines the process of tracking, seizing, and managing illicit cryptocurrency funds. Tax Administration Efficiency: The National Tax Service can leverage these accounts for more efficient tax administration related to crypto assets. As crypto gains become taxable in many jurisdictions, providing official channels for government tax agencies to interact with exchanges becomes crucial for compliance and revenue collection. Local Government Initiatives: Local governments may explore using crypto for various initiatives, such as managing public funds, disbursing welfare payments, or even experimenting with blockchain-based governance solutions. Upbit’s move opens doors for local administrations to explore these possibilities within a regulated exchange environment. Impact on Crypto Regulation in South Korea South Korea has been at the forefront of crypto adoption and regulation. Upbit’s initiative to facilitate government accounts could have a profound impact on the regulatory landscape. Here’s how: Aspect Potential Impact Increased Legitimacy Government participation lends further legitimacy to the crypto industry, potentially encouraging wider public and institutional acceptance. Regulatory Clarity Direct government engagement can provide clearer signals about regulatory expectations and priorities, reducing uncertainty for crypto businesses. Policy Development First-hand experience with crypto transactions through exchange accounts can inform more effective and practical crypto policy development by government agencies. Global Precedent South Korea’s approach could serve as a model for other nations grappling with crypto regulation, potentially influencing global standards. This development indicates a maturing relationship between the South Korean government and the crypto sector. Instead of just regulating from a distance, government agencies are now becoming active participants within the ecosystem, facilitated by platforms like Upbit. Boosting Institutional Crypto Adoption Institutional crypto adoption has been a major theme in the crypto space, and Upbit’s announcement is a significant step in this direction. While “institutional adoption” often refers to corporations and financial institutions, government agencies represent another crucial facet of institutional involvement. How does this move accelerate broader adoption? Signaling Confidence: When government bodies start using crypto exchange services, it sends a powerful signal of confidence to other institutions. It suggests that crypto is not just a fringe asset class but a legitimate tool for various organizations, including those in the public sector. Setting an Example: Government agencies, often viewed as conservative and risk-averse, venturing into crypto can encourage other large institutions to explore and adopt digital assets. It can break down perceived barriers and reduce hesitancy. Expanding Use Cases: Government involvement can drive the development of new and practical use cases for cryptocurrencies. As agencies explore applications for crypto in governance, finance, and public services, it can inspire innovation and broader adoption across different sectors. Market Maturation: Increased institutional participation, including from government entities, contributes to the overall maturation and stability of the crypto market. It reduces volatility and fosters a more sustainable ecosystem. Upbit’s initiative can be viewed as a catalyst for broader institutional crypto adoption , demonstrating that digital assets are becoming increasingly integrated into mainstream institutional frameworks. Benefits of Government Crypto Accounts on Upbit What specific advantages do Upbit government accounts offer to the agencies themselves and the wider crypto ecosystem? Secure and Compliant Platform: Upbit is a regulated and reputable exchange, providing government agencies with a secure and compliant platform to conduct virtual asset transactions . This is crucial for organizations that must adhere to strict security and regulatory standards. Dedicated Support: It’s likely that Upbit will offer dedicated support and account management services tailored to the needs of government agencies, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience. Transparency and Auditability: Exchange accounts offer a transparent and auditable record of all transactions, which is essential for government accountability and oversight. Potential for Innovation: Access to crypto exchange infrastructure opens doors for government agencies to experiment with blockchain technology and explore innovative applications in various public sectors. For government agencies, Upbit government accounts provide a structured, secure, and compliant gateway into the world of cryptocurrencies, enabling them to engage with digital assets in a responsible and controlled manner. Challenges and Considerations While this is a positive development, there are also challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Security Risks: Despite Upbit’s security measures, crypto exchanges are still targets for cyberattacks. Government agencies must implement robust security protocols to protect their accounts and digital assets. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market poses risks. Government agencies need to develop strategies to manage price fluctuations and potential losses. Regulatory Evolution: Crypto regulations are constantly evolving. Government agencies must stay updated on the latest rules and ensure ongoing compliance. Public Perception: Public perception of government involvement in crypto can be mixed. Clear communication and transparency are crucial to build public trust and address potential concerns. Actionable Insights For individuals and businesses in the crypto space, Upbit’s move offers several key takeaways: Increased Regulatory Acceptance: This development signals growing regulatory acceptance of crypto in South Korea and potentially globally. It reinforces the trend of crypto moving towards mainstream integration. Opportunities for Collaboration: Businesses can explore opportunities to collaborate with government agencies in developing blockchain-based solutions and services. Focus on Compliance: The emphasis on regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly important. Crypto businesses should prioritize adherence to evolving regulations to ensure long-term sustainability. Positive Market Sentiment: News like this can boost market sentiment and attract further investment into the crypto space, as it demonstrates growing institutional confidence. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Crypto Mainstream Upbit enabling government accounts is more than just a policy update; it’s a bold statement about the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in society. It signifies a crucial step towards mainstream adoption, with government agencies now becoming active participants in the crypto ecosystem. This move is poised to enhance regulatory clarity, accelerate institutional crypto adoption , and potentially set a global precedent for how governments engage with virtual asset transactions . As South Korea continues to lead in crypto innovation and regulation, Upbit’s initiative paves the way for a more integrated and mature digital asset landscape. The implications of this decision are far-reaching, promising to reshape the future of crypto in South Korea and beyond.

The sudden spike in exchange inflows is raising eyebrows, with some reading it as a prelude to a selloff, while others believe it could be a bullish repositioning move. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Maarten Regterschot, Binance’s BTC reserves surged by 22,106 BTC over the past 12 days—now sitting at 590,874 BTC. The timing of these transfers appears to coincide with rising unease over U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and the imminent release of CPI data for March. “This level of inflow is not usual unless investors are hedging against volatility or preparing to take profits,” Regterschot noted in an April 9 commentary. At the time of his analysis, Bitcoin was already on an upward tear, trading at $82,000—up nearly 6.5% in 24 hours—buoyed by Trump’s announcement easing trade tensions , except with China. Bullish Setup or Early Signs of Exit? Yet not everyone is reading the surge in inflows as a bearish omen. Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Swyftx, highlighted that high exchange inflows can be misleading. “Sure, it might mean people are getting ready to sell, but it could also mean Binance is simply shifting reserves to hot wallets to meet increasing demand,” Hundal explained. He stressed that the next few days would be crucial. “The CPI data will either reinforce the recent rally or shake it. Either way, the market’s appetite for risk will be tested.” Trump’s tariff pause—except for a hefty 125% hike on China—has temporarily calmed markets, but Hundal believes geopolitical uncertainty remains a “structural overhang” for risk assets, including crypto. All Eyes on CPI and Inflation Clues Meanwhile, crypto analysts are focused squarely on the CPI numbers, which could set the tone for Bitcoin next move. Matthew Hyland suggested inflation might be falling sharply, perhaps nearing 2.5%, while fellow analyst Dyme expects that a “lower-than-expected CPI print will send us higher.” Economists polled by FactSet anticipate a modest 0.1% increase in March’s CPI, in line with the surprise drop last month to 3.1%. If inflation continues cooling, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge asset may regain strength—right when traders need it most.

Here is Codename:Pepe, a memecoin poised for a 10,000% breakout Dogecoin tests support amid recent declines Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has dropped significantly over the past week and month, declining by 15.44% and 17.10% respectively. It is currently trading between $0.1525 and $0.1941. Despite short-term losses, Dogecoin has gained 51.61% over the past six months, indicating potential for long-term growth. The RSI stands at 39.89, suggesting the coin may be nearing oversold territory. The nearest support level is $0.1377. If the price holds above this, it could rebound. The nearest resistance is at $0.2209. Breaking this level might indicate a bullish trend. If Dogecoin bounces from support, it could rise about 44% to the resistance level. However, if it falls below support, further declines are possible. Traders should watch these levels closely. Shiba Inu declines, testing key support levels Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) has recently experienced a notable decline in its price. Over the past week, the coin’s value dropped by 13.74%, and it’s down by 5.04% over the past month. In the last six months, SHIB has seen a significant decrease of 29.65%. These consecutive declines indicate a bearish trend that might concern investors. Currently, SHIB’s price hovers between $0.00001126 and $0.00001465. The nearest support level is at $0.00001007. If the price continues to fall and breaks this support, it could signal further declines. On the other hand, the nearest resistance level is at $0.00001685. Overcoming this resistance could indicate a potential reversal in the downtrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 43.77. An RSI below 50 suggests that the asset is losing momentum. However, with the RSI approaching the oversold territory, there might be potential for a price rebound if buying pressure increases. Conclusion In a landscape where DOGE and SHIB have already had their moment, their potential for significant short-term gains appears limited. While they were once at the forefront of the memecoin surge, their impact has diminished as the market seeks new opportunities with greater promise. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a compelling alternative, leveraging genuine artificial intelligence to maximize profits. This coin provides real utility by offering AI-powered trading signals and automated trading capabilities, enabling investors to seize lucrative opportunities ahead of the crowd. With its community-driven approach and unique features, Codename:Pepe crypto positions itself as a standout contender for those looking to capitalize on the next big wave in the crypto arena.

43171176,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=708374,1744291915,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43171176.jpeg,US inflation falls below 3% for the first time in 4 years,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-inflation-falls-below-3/,"Inflation just dropped below 3% for the first time in four years. That’s straight from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it hit the wires Thursday as Donald Trump geared up to launch a new wave of tariffs on U.S. trade partners. March numbers came in cooler than anyone expected. Price growth didn’t just slow down—it straight up slipped. The consumer price index, which tracks how much everyday stuff costs, went down 0.1% in March after adjusting for seasonality. That 0.1% drop pulled the 12-month inflation rate to 2.4%. It’s a sharp shift, and it means things aren’t getting more expensive as fast as they were. But let’s not pretend everything’s cheap now. Certain prices are still climbing, just not enough to stop the overall rate from dropping. Inflation outlook: Gas and shelter prices shift as food costs climb Energy costs took the biggest hit. Gasoline prices fell hard—down 6.3% in March. That drop played a big role in the 2.4% overall fall in the energy index. Cheaper gas gave the inflation data room to breathe. That’s how the headline number dropped even while other things like food kept going up. Monthly food prices rose 0.4%. Eggs led that jump, again. They went up 5.9% in just one month. Compared to last year, egg prices are still insane—up 60.4% from March 2024. Shelter prices didn’t fall, but they didn’t rise much either. Rent, mortgage, and housing-related costs rose just 0.2% in March. That’s one of the smallest increases we’ve seen from shelter, which usually doesn’t move much unless something big is happening. Over the last year, shelter prices are still up 4%, but that’s a smaller hit than most months in the past few years. Now look at cars. Used vehicle prices dropped 0.7%. New car prices barely moved—they were up just 0.1%. All of this happened before the expected hit from Trump’s tariffs. Once those kick in, the auto market could shift fast. For now, it’s calm before the storm. The core inflation rate tells a slightly different story. That’s the one that strips out food and energy prices. It’s useful because food and fuel tend to bounce all over the place. In March, core inflation only went up 0.1%. On a yearly basis, core prices rose 2.8%. That’s the lowest year-over-year increase since March 2021. That’s a big deal. Core prices usually don’t drop fast, especially when food and fuel are swinging up and down. So a 2.8% rate shows that even the sticky stuff—like rent and medical costs—isn’t rising as fast as it used to. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Now, it looks to be an unprecedented fourth term for the Liberal Party, led by former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney, with a contract on Myriad Markets , a new prediction market, giving Carney a 74% chance of taking office. Back in January, a poll tracker from CBC projected that the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, could have made history winning up to 244 of the 338 seats in Canada's Parliament. Justin Trudeau's Liberals may have been relegated to third place, an astonishing fall for a party whose leader entered Ottawa as one of Canada's most liked . At the time, Quebec's Bloc Quebecois – a federal party that solely exists to advance Quebec's interests on the national stage – assumed the role of official opposition. But much has changed since then. January 6 was the day that Trudeau announced his resignation and polls reflected the last days of what one columnist for the National Post described as a ""legacy of chaos and disaster."" This is continuing coverage of the Canadian election as part of an exclusive arrangement between myriad markets and Consensus by CoinDesk . Consensus 2025 will take place in Toronto May 14-16. The Conservative party had already been in campaign mode weeks before Trudeau's resignation, latching on to inflation and Canada's declining post-Covid affordability and were rewarded with it handsomely in the polls. Voters weren't impressed with the Liberal's proposals on carbon taxes and Trudeau's plans for housing affordability were seen as not scratching the surface of the problem. On January 7, there was no Trudeau. Without a foil, Poilievre was suddenly less effective and likeable. While the Conservatives have a whole library of policies, the headline was about Trudeau. There was no other ballot box question. Polls showed that the Conservative's lead was beginning to slip. Then Donald Trump entered the fray. A trade war with Canada's largest trading partner – something unfathomable a year ago – became a reality. Carney won the race to replace Trudeau as Liberal leader – temporarily becoming the country's prime minister. With Carney at the helm, the Liberals leaped into a significant lead nationally. Carney, a former central banker, outpaced Poilievre in favorability ratings, reflecting widespread public sentiment that an experienced central banker was more trustworthy to handle pressing economic challenges than a lifelong partisan operative. Carney's significant experience on Bay Street, Wall Street, and in central banks ticked a lot of the right boxes for the electorate, putting him on track, as Myriad Markets' election contract shows, to be elected as Canada's twenty-fourth prime minister. The Canadian election contract is one of the 30-odd markets currently on the platform, which cover a variety of topics from crypto prices, to the launch date of Grand Theft Auto VI. Myriad Markets is a brainchild of the Decrypt and Rug Radio team , which launched it last year as part of a “interconnected media ecosystem” that integrates on-chain prediction markets alongside written and video content. Crypto not on the Ballot The Trump campaign doubled-down on crypto in the election as a way to get swing voters to the ballot box. As Conservative party leader, Poilievre said in late 2022 that he wanted to make Canada the ""Blockchain capital of the world"". Disclosures show he holds shares in the Purpose Bitcoin ETF. A 2022 survey from the Ontario Securities Commission showed that 13% of Canadians owned crypto assets, of which most were male and under 45. One might wonder, then, why crypto isn't a bigger issue in this election. It could be that part of the reason why is corporations are not allowed to fund political operations as they do in the United States; around $120 million – or about half of all corporate money donated – in the last election came from crypto companies. Poilievre likely believes crypto is not worth dwelling on amid broader economic uncertainty and cross-border tensions that are top-of-mind for voters. Crypto industry groups are waiting until after the election to press their case, seeing it as tone-deaf to push on crypto issues right now. Whoever wins, they will have to work closely with Canada’s provinces, which control securities regulation. This is likely why crypto has only gotten moderate attention in Parliament in Ottawa. Any sort of development would likely come from the Provinces. Crypto regulation in Canada is a featured topic at Consensus 2025 in Toronto , which takes place from May 14-16.",Consensus Toronto 2025 Coverage|Canada|Mark Carney|Elections,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-10 13:40:05

To read full editions, subscribe . We’re thinking about stablecoin classification all wrong, Agora CEO Nick van Eck told me. It’s easy to lump all of the stablecoins into one single bucket, but the reality is that the offerings are quickly becoming more unique and different as the space matures. A lot of stablecoins are “very different, and have very different user profiles,” which means they “ultimately don’t even end up competing.” “Someone who is looking to use USDe as a form of collateral is 95% of the time probably not the same user of AUSD or USDC. Maybe they’ll use it for trading, but [if]… you want to buy a treasury bill or a treasury bond, you don’t buy a corporate bond, right?” You have centralized high-trust stablecoins, which include Agora or Circle. Then there’s centralized opaque, which would be Tether. The difference between the two is the amount of transparency offered, but both categories are focused on the global monetary network perspective. Another is “centralized captive distribution,” which includes gaming companies or banks like Bank of America (CEO Brian Moynihan previously teased that the bank’s interested in such an offering). The idea here is that companies in this category are more interested in keeping their stablecoin offering within their business rather than expanding globally, van Eck explained. The fourth and final one is decentralized stablecoins. This broader category captures the likes of Ethena, which van Eck praised as a “very good operator,” and some of the more experimental forays into stablecoins. Agora’s customer base, van Eck noted, is usually made up of folks just coming into crypto, not more seasoned people who want to make a return on their collateral. The team aims to create a global stablecoin network. “We see a world where AUSD is traded on every single exchange and has global liquidity,” he told me. This opens the door for folks to build on top of Agora and “tap into our tooling and cross-chain infrastructure, our centralized exchange infrastructure, our FX on and off ramps.” As lawmakers mull and vote on stablecoin legislation, van Eck is excited about what it means for the space. While he told me never say never when it comes to yield-bearing stablecoins — that’s not going to be a priority for Agora. “From day one, I was very much expecting that the US government and the SEC would not allow interest-bearing stablecoins, which is why we designed our model as one-to-one, where we just share underlying economics with the businesses, versus it being natively yield-bearing.” No skin off of Agora’s back, especially since it seems lawmakers aren’t too keen on yield-bearing stablecoins, either.

After experiencing a sharp 21.2% correction that saw prices tumble from $0.165 to $0.130, DOGE has staged a significant recovery, while the broader crypto market staged a comeback as the CoinDesk 20 Index rose 9% in the last 24 hours. It established strong support around the $0.142-$0.145 zone with substantial buying volume, confirming the rebound's legitimacy. Technical Analysis Breakdown DOGE/USD experienced extreme volatility, dropping from $0.165 to $0.130 (21.2% range) before staging a significant recovery. A strong bullish reversal pattern formed with solid support established in the $0.142-$0.145 zone, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Volume analysis confirms recovery legitimacy, with peak accumulation during the April 9th rally pushing prices above the critical $0.160 resistance. Price currently consolidating at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level with horizontal support at $0.155. In recent trading, DOGE formed a clear ascending channel with support at $0.155 and resistance at $0.156. Significant accumulation occurred during the 11:32 period with 7 million units of volume, confirming buyer interest. 30 minutes of trading during early U.S. hours showed increasing momentum with consecutive higher lows and a breakthrough above the $0.156 resistance. The pattern suggests a potential continuation of the uptrend toward the previous 48-hour high of $0.165.

The filing, signed by Nasdaq’s executive vice president and chief legal officer John Zecca, requests approval to list and trade shares of the VanEck Avalanche ETF under the company’s Rule 5711(d), which governs the trading of commodity-based trust shares. If approved, the VanEck Avalanche ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to the Avalanche ( AVAX ) price without directly holding them. The ETF would hold the tokens and track their price, allowing investors to profit from the token’s performance without needing crypto wallets or using digital asset trading platforms. According to the filing, asset manager VanEck Digital Assets will sponsor the trust, while a third-party custodian will hold all the Avalanche tokens on the trust’s behalf.

The application marks the fourth standalone crypto ETF product submitted by VanEck, alongside its Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) ETF products. In 2024, VanEck filed for a spot Solana ETF , becoming one of the first issuers to file for a SOL-based ETF. On March 14, VanEck’s formal application for the Avalanche ETF was shared publicly via social media , signaling the firm’s commitment to the product. Grayscale Investments is also pursuing an AVAX-backed ETF. On March 28, Nasdaq applied to list Grayscale’s Avalanche ETF . The product would be a conversion of a close-ended AVAX fund launched by the asset manager in August 2024. Despite the interest in exchange-traded products based on AVAX, the token suffered massive losses in 2025 as the broader crypto markets saw a downturn.

According to an April 10 announcement , Eureka has expanded the Cosmos IBC protocol, changing IBC from an ecosystem standard “to a universal interoperability protocol,” setting the hub on a course to become the home of multichain apps. Cosmos projects are integrating into IBC Eureka. Source: Cosmos With the introduction of Eureka, many Cosmos-based applications and blockchains are now accessible to more users by expanding IBC to the Ethereum network. With the new protocol, developers can reportedly build multichain apps across multiple ecosystems without fragmenting the user base. Related: Cosmos co-founder proposes peer-to-peer clearing system in white paper The announcement said that most projects rely on bridges for interoperability , resulting in the introduction of intermediaries as well as user and liquidity fragmentation. With bridges, users can simply move assets between blockchains, while with Eureka, developers promise to deliver native interoperability. Cosmos Hub Integration Image. Source: Cosmos Cointelegraph reached out to the Interchain Foundation, the organization behind Cosmos , but did not receive a response by publication. How IBC Eureka works Eureka relies on a distribution zone allowing developers to access all IBC connections, users, liquidity and services without additional infrastructure. The Cosmos Hub also allows users to access apps, services and assets across the included ecosystems. Related: Cosmos ecosystem rocked by North Korean developer allegations Some early use cases include Bitcoin staking protocol Babylon, whose users will now be able to transfer Bitcoin liquid staking tokens from Ethereum to Babylon’s Cosmos-based chain. Similarly, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Elys will enable trading with Wrapped Ether (WETH), Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) and USDt ( USDT ) from Ethereum. More integrations coming In the future, developers promise that users will be able to leverage Eureka-powered multichain features in major decentralized exchange (DEX) dYdX. Real-world asset tokenization platform Mantra will also reportedly bridge capital from Ethereum into Cosmos-based real-estate markets, staking infrastructure and permissioned DeFi applications. According to the announcement, IBC — which Eureka upgrades — has facilitated an average of up to $3 billion in transaction volume among more than 115 blockchains every month since its launch. Still, the integration was far from seamless for blockchains that were not part of the Cosmos ecosystem.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) price was up 5% over the past 24 hours, trading above $81,000, while Solana ( SOL ) rose to $115. Some of the top-performing altcoins were Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Flare ( FLR ), Bittensor ( TAO ), and Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ), which soared by over 15%. Crypto prices rose for four main reasons. First, the primary catalyst was Donald Trump’s decision to pause his ‘reciprocal’ tariffs on over 70 countries, easing worries that the U.S. was heading toward a major recession, given that it is one of the largest importers globally. Pausing these tariffs led to a strong surge even in the equities market, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 rising by 2,932 and 1,900 points, respectively. However, these gains were capped after Trump raised China tariffs to 125%.

The headline inflation dropped from 2.8% to 2.4%, while the core figure fell from 3.1% to 2.8%. US CPI inflation for March was better (lower) than the consensus forecasts — across the board. The monthly price changes came in at -0.1% for headline and 0.1% for core. This took the annual measures down to 2.4% and 2.8%, respectively — low levels not seen for several years.… https://t.co/xDeYFZ8y0W — Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) April 10, 2025 These numbers suggest that U.S. inflation is moving in the right direction as it approaches the Federal Reserve’s target of 2.0%. As a result, with the economy slowing and consumer confidence falling, there is a growing chance that the Fed will deliver more cuts than expected. Crypto prices typically perform well when the Fed cuts rates, driving more investors toward riskier assets. Third, prices climbed after Donald Trump hinted that Republicans were working together to pass his “Big, Beautiful Bill,” his flagship tax proposal. The bill would slash individual and corporate taxes at a projected cost of $4.5 trillion over a decade. For example, it would eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay. Some of these savings could flow into the crypto industry.

Atkins is expected to be more favorable to the crypto industry than Gary Gensler, who prioritized litigation. The SEC has already ended lawsuits against top crypto companies like Ripple Labs , Uniswap, and Coinbase.

The crypto market registered substantial gains, with some tokens rallying nearly 50%. Crypto stocks also registered significant gains, with the S&P 500 posting its third-largest single-day gain since World War 2. Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to surge past $80,000 and reach a day high of $83,453 before marginally declining to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency has maintained its position above $80,000 and is currently up almost 6% and trading at $81,903. Ethereum (ETH) registered a substantial recovery as well, with the price rising over 8% and settling at $1,600. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) reclaimed $1 after a rally of nearly 10%, while Solana (SOL) solidified its position above $100 with an increase of almost 7%. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. As a result, the crypto market cap has surged over 5% and currently stands at $2.58 trillion. Crypto Market Rallies As Trump Pauses Tariffs The crypto market rallied sharply on Thursday after President Donald Trump paused tariffs for 90 days, sparking a bull run in the equity market and bringing much-needed respite for risk assets like crypto. As a result, BTC rallied nearly 8% from a day low of $74,624 to a day high of $83,605 before registering a marginal decline and settling around $82,000. Markets rebounded thanks to a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs, easing investor sentiment. Paul Atkins's confirmation as the new SEC Chair also contributed to the positive sentiment. Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO at Mudrex, stated, “The crypto market saw a strong rebound after Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, easing investor sentiment. Ethereum gained attention as the SEC approved Options on spot Ethereum ETFs, broadening the investment appeal of Ether among institutional traders. If the momentum continues, Bitcoin's rally to $100,000 is back on the table with the next major resistance at $88,600 and support at $80,000.” Other tokens, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and others, rallied between 8% and 10%. However, tokens like ZCash and Tezos registered declines. The tariff pause and Paul Atkins’ confirmation as SEC Chair provided a boost to the crypto ecosystem, said Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder and CEO at Pi42. “With regulatory clarity continuing to improve and macroeconomic conditions stabilizing, the momentum among top cryptocurrencies implies that we might be witnessing a new era of mainstream adoption and long-term appreciation in the digital asset universe.” Crypto Stocks See Big Gains Crypto stocks have rallied as part of a broader market recovery following the announcement of a 90-day pause on sweeping global tariffs. Michael Saylor’s Strategy jumped almost 25%, rising to $296.86, while Coinbase rose 17% to close at $177.09, according to data from Google Finance. Crypto mining companies also saw substantial gains, with MARA Holdings (MARA) up 17%. Cipher Platforms (CIFR) rose 16.59%, while Riot Platforms (RIOT) registered a 12.77% increase. Most of the gains were registered during the final three hours of the trading session as markets were boosted by an afternoon post from Trump on his social media. Trump announced a 90-day pause on his global reciprocal tariffs, lowering the rate to 10% for every country besides China. Trump increased tariffs on China to 125% thanks to the country’s counter-tariffs against the US. Buoyed by the news, the S&P 500 closed 9.52% higher, its third-largest single-day increase since World War 2, while the Nasdaq 100 gained 12.02% over the day. “At some point, hopefully, in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA and other Countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) surged almost 10% after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on sweeping reciprocal tariffs. However, he raised tariffs on China to 125% after it refused to withdraw reciprocal tariffs on the US. Countries that have not retaliated against the US tariffs have seen the tariffs drop to 10%, effective immediately. BTC, which was trading around $77,000, responded almost immediately to the news, surging past $80,000 and reaching a day high of $83,605. However, the rally has brought a warning from analysts at QCP Capital, who said BTC risks becoming a classic bull trap whenever the US-China trade war takes its next step. Analysts from QCP Capital cautioned investors over BTC’s latest rebound in a bulletin on Telegram. BTC and most other cryptocurrencies rallied over the past 24 hours after the 90-day tariff pause. According to QCP, investors must brace themselves for China’s next move after the US increased tariffs on the country to 125% effective immediately. “With China singled out so explicitly, market participants are bracing for Beijing’s counterpunch. Should retaliation materialize in force, the exuberant rally could quickly morph into a classic bull trap.” Such a scenario would be a repeat of market behavior that unfolded earlier in the week when a rumor of a tariff pause sparked a rally and then an immediate decline. QCP cautioned analysts, stating, “The surprise policy pivot temporarily soothed market anxiety, driving short-end crypto vols lower. Still, we advocate caution. Our desk continues to observe topside selling in May and June, suggesting that market makers are using the rally as an opportunity to offload unwanted positions.” BTC’s price action has shown incredible volatility over the past few weeks. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal increase last Monday before registering an increase of over 3%, moving past $85,000 and the 20-day SMA to $85,152. The price surged to an intraday high of $88,624 on Wednesday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3%, slipping below $85,000 and the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,525. BTC recovered on Thursday, registering an increase of 0.82%, and continued its upward push on Friday, rising 0.76% to settle at $83,828. However, bearish sentiment returned over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop and settled at $83,423. Source: TradingView BTC plunged over 6% on Sunday as markets tanked. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency slipped below $80,000 and settled at $78,301. It faced significant volatility on Monday as rumors swirled about a tariff pause. As a result, BTC fell to a low of $74,393 before surging past $80,000 and then dropping to settle at $79,164, ultimately registering an increase of 1.10%. BTC was back in the red on Tuesday falling almost 4% to $76,283. Markets rallied on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause. As a result, BTC surged over 8%, reaching an intraday high of $83,605 before settling at $82,593. The current session sees BTC down almost 1% and trading at $81,768. Buyers will look to prevent a drop below $80,000 and move towards $85,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) declined during the current session after registering a rally of over 13% on Wednesday. Despite the rally, ETH is struggling to recapture key levels, the latest being $1,600. Analysts have suggested it could witness a deeper correction before a sustained recovery. According to the available data, ETH has slipped below its realized price, historically considered a bearish metric. “Drops below the realized price often mark the capitulation phase, where investors lose confidence and begin selling en masse.” ETH has been trading downwards, with the exception being Wednesday’s rally. It got off to a positive start the previous week, rising almost 1% on Monday and nearly 5% on Tuesday to move past $1,900 and settle at $1,905. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday as the price fell over 6%, slipping below $1,800 and settling at $1,794. ETH recovered on Thursday despite overwhelming selling pressure, registering an increase of 1.26% to reclaim $1,800 and settle at $1,817.

Elon Musk, once celebrated as a tech visionary behind Tesla and SpaceX, has faced growing backlash due to his political ties, controversial corporate decisions and provocative public statements. Born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk co-founded Zip2 in 1995, which was sold to Compaq in 1999. He then launched X.com, which merged with Confinity to form PayPal, acquired by eBay in 2002. His later ventures, SpaceX (2002) and Tesla (2004), solidified his status as a leading innovator in aerospace and electric vehicles. In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion and later rebranded the platform as X, integrating it into his broader vision for an “everything app.” Initially celebrated for his technological contributions, Musk’s public image began to shift in the late 2010s for several reasons: Political involvement: Musk’s association with conservative politics, notably his support for US President Donald Trump and his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) , drew criticism. His advocacy for significant federal spending cuts and program eliminations fueled discontent. Corporate practices: Decisions like relocating Tesla’s headquarters from California to Texas and implementing controversial labor practices contributed to negative perceptions. These actions were seen as prioritizing profit over employee welfare and regulatory compliance. Public statements: Musk’s public communications, especially on social media , often sparked controversy. Critics accused him of spreading misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories, which eroded trust among certain groups. Did you know? Despite popular narratives of Elon Musk as a self-made entrepreneur, he came from a wealthy South African family. His father, Errol Musk, is suspected of owning an emerald mine in Zambia, and Elon has acknowledged receiving financial support from his family during his early ventures. Anti-Elon Musk protests in 2025 By 2025, the aforementioned factors culminated in widespread protests targeting Musk and his business interests. The demonstrations were driven by core grievances: Wealth disparity: Musk’s net worth , which reached $400 billion in December 2024, had declined to $298 billion by April 2025 due to stock market fluctuations and political controversies. His accumulation of wealth highlighted growing economic inequalities, with protesters viewing it as emblematic of systemic issues favoring the ultra-wealthy. Political influence: Musk’s significant political engagement, particularly his advisory role to Trump and influence over DOGE policies , has raised concerns about the concentration of power among wealthy elites. Critics feared this influence undermined democratic processes and prioritized corporate interests over public welfare. Corporate practices: Actions such as aggressive cost-cutting measures, perceived labor exploitation and controversial business decisions led to dissatisfaction among employees and consumers. The “Tesla Takedown” movement, for example, targeted Tesla showrooms, criticizing Musk’s leadership and corporate strategies. Social and environmental concerns: Musk’s business decisions were also scrutinized for their social and environmental impact. Protesters questioned Tesla’s labor practices and the environmental implications of some of his ventures, calling for more ethical and sustainable corporate behaviors. Did you know? A March 2025 Brookings op-ed called DOGE’s naming choice a “branding blunder,” while a CNN/ORC poll found 62% of respondents viewed it as “inappropriate” for a government agency and 44% felt it damaged confidence in the administration’s reform efforts. Tesla protest events in 2025 The “Tesla Takedown” movement, with demonstrations in over 250 cities worldwide, aimed to challenge Musk’s influence. Originating in early 2025, this grassroots initiative organized nonviolent protests at Tesla locations across the US, Canada, Europe and Australia. Protesters called for boycotts and urged the public to divest from Tesla by selling their vehicles and shares, intending to economically impact Musk and question his political influence. Two key factors fueled the protests: Labor practices: Tesla faced allegations of labor rights violations, including reports of employees being fired for expressing dissenting opinions. The National Labor Relations Board had 24 open investigations into Musk’s companies, including allegations of illegal firings at SpaceX. Environmental concerns: Protesters criticized Tesla’s environmental record, highlighting issues such as alleged negligence in the installation and maintenance of solar panels, which led to roof fires at Walmart stores. Walmart filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming negligent installation and maintenance of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012. Declining sales figures underscored consumer discontent. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla’s global vehicle deliveries dropped 13% year-over-year to 336,681 units, marking the company’s lowest quarterly performance since mid-2022. Did you know? While intended to be peaceful, some protests escalated into acts of vandalism. For example, on March 24, 2025, incendiary devices were discovered at a Tesla dealership in Austin, Texas. SpaceX controversy 2025 SpaceX’s activities also attracted scrutiny, particularly regarding safety and regulatory compliance. The 2025 Starship explosion served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with private space exploration. The largest and most powerful rocket ever built disintegrated minutes after liftoff, scattering debris across protected areas and reigniting debates about safety, environmental responsibility and regulatory oversight in the private spaceflight industry. Musk’s political involvement further complicated matters. Serving as the head of DOGE, he oversaw significant federal spending cuts and deregulation efforts. This role led to conflicts of interest, especially concerning agencies that regulate his businesses. For example, SpaceX faced fines from the Federal Aviation Administration for safety violations, including operating an unapproved launch control room and using non-approved rocket fuel, totaling $633,009. What does the future hold for Elon Musk amid growing backlash? Musk’s entanglement in political affairs, particularly his advisory role to President Trump and leadership of DOGE, has led to significant public disapproval. A February 2025 poll indicated that 52% of Americans held an unfavorable view of Musk, with only 29% expressing approval. In response to the mounting criticism, reports suggest that Musk is considering stepping back from his governmental advisory role to focus on his business ventures. Such a move could be aimed at mitigating public perception that his political activities are adversely affecting Tesla’s performance. However, given Musk’s history of unconventional decisions and resilience, it’s uncertain whether distancing himself from politics will fully quell public dissent or restore consumer confidence in Tesla.",Elon Musk,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-10 13:50:00

Protocols like email and the web were open and neutral - and they sparked an explosion of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship. But somewhere along the way, we veered off course,” the article says. The authors compare the current financial system to a ”patchwork quilt” represented as separate corporate networks, closed and centralized. And behind every transaction there is an intermediary, and sometimes several. ”Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies tied to stable assets like U.S. dollar , are a way out, a reboot, a way to bring the original vision of the internet to money,” the company said. WhatsApp moment for the financial system The a16z believes that stablecoins are an attempt to do for transactions what email has done for communication by removing barriers. Before the advent of messengers, sending text messages by phone overseas was expensive and unreliable because the recipient did not always receive it. ”Payments are now where messaging was in 2008: fragmented by borders, burdened by intermediaries, controlled by design,” the authors noted. As a16z noted, stablecoins represent an alternative. Instead of trying to ”stitch together” legacy corporate networks, they flow on top of them. They make translations cheaper, more accessible and faster. The company cited a $200 tranche to Colombia as an example. Sending the transfer through a bank, according to a16z, would cost $12.13, $0.01 in stablecoins. ”Just as WhatsApp has disrupted the pricing of international phone calls, blockchain-based payments and steblecoins are transforming global money transfers,” the article said. The company also noted that the creation of a regulatory framework, obviously the U.S. is involved here, is not a barrier, but a way for stablecoins to move beyond the sandbox and onto the path of global adoption. ”For years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has been locked in a kind of closed, circular crypto-for-crypto economy. Not because the tools were useless, but because regulators made it incredibly difficult to transition into traditional financial systems. That is changing,” the authors emphasized. The company envisions blockchain technology as ”public highways,” the natural layer of the Internet. Private companies can build their cars, businesses or roadside infrastructure, but the highways themselves will remain open to everyone. Apart from the main advantages of reduced commissions and increased speed, stablecoins have a number of other pluses, the article says. These include commission-free global trading, payments between AI agents, programmable deductions and full transparency. ”Just as early Internet startups were able to thrive when it became clear they wouldn't be shut down by telecom companies or copyright lawyers, cryptocurrency is poised to bridge the chasm from financial experiment to infrastructure backbone, and stablecoins are leading the way,” the authors summarized. Tether CEO announces the beginning of the era of stablecoins Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether — issuer of the USDT stablecoin — has announced the start of a new era called the ”multiverse of steiblcoins”. He noted that hundreds of companies and governments have launched or will soon launch their own ”stable coins.” In addition, Ardoino said the number of USDT users is more than 400 million users worldwide. Soon - 1 billion, the Tether CEO added. Tether's CEO says the company has ”been through hell” Tether has ”been through hell” as it faces scrutiny from US authorities. This is reported by CoinDesk , citing the firm's CEO Paolo Ardoino. The head of Tether took part in the Cantor Fitzgerald Global Technology Conference. It was held on March 11 and 12, 2025 in New York City. Ardoino noted that this was his first trip to the United States. However, he was allegedly dissuaded from it because of the scrutiny of the authorities: ”There were people who said I would be arrested if I came to the United States. But we're still here, right?” Tether's CEO noted the warm welcome. He said he was happy to be in the U.S. and emphasized the company's close ties to this market; Notably, despite the fact that Tether is one of the largest corporate holders of US Treasury bonds and its stablecoin — USDT — is pegged to the dollar, the firm is not registered in America. Its headquarters are located in El Salvador. This is one of the reasons for criticism of the organization. Thus, in particular, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, although not mentioning the competitor directly, that issuers of dollar-stablecoins should register in the United States; As part of the conference, Ardoino also touched on the company's plans. According to him, the firm will focus on three areas in 2025: real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, education and AI.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-10 13:53:08

Following each monthly unlock, Ripple allocates a portion of the XRP for operational purposes, while the remaining tokens are often returned to escrow for future distribution. Until January, the monthly releases were executed from ‘ Ripple (24) ’ and ‘ Ripple (25) ’. Notably, the 300 million XRP in sales and subsequent re-locks in February originated from these older accounts, drawing on their remaining balances. Featured image from Shutterstock.

After President Donald Trump promised more great days ahead, akin to Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) price led the wider altcoin market in mild recovery on Thursday, during the mid-New York session. Earlier on Thursday, Ursula von der Leyen, EC President, noted that the European Union intends to give negotiations a chance following Trump’s 90-day suspension of the historical reciprocal tariffs. “If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in. Preparatory work on further countermeasures continues. As I have said before, all options remain on the table,” Von der Leyen said earlier on Thursday. Crypto Market Outlook The crypto market is at a crucial juncture in the post- 2024 Bitcoin halving cycle, with some on-chain analysts calling for the onset of the macro bear market while others anticipating a parabolic rally before the end of this year. The bullish outlook, however, is gradually gaining momentum. Furthermore, the VIX index dropped sharply in the past 24 hours to 37.20, after Trump’s announcement on Wednesday, signaling rising odds of market reversal in the near term. Additionally, Gold price extended its gains on Thursday to trade at about $3,124 at the time of this writing. From a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin price , in the 1-hour time frame, has been forming a potential falling wedge after Thursday’s bump. As a result, BTC price is well positioned to rally towards $88k next, especially if the buyers hold their positions. A rise in Bitcoin will carry the wider altcoin market, led by Solana (SOL), BNB, Ethereum (ETH), and Toncoin (TON), among others. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000634, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000575. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price failed to hold above $0.0000071. This resulted in a sharp decline toward $0.0000066. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers defend the $0.0000063 level strongly, we might see a recovery rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news A major Pepe coin investor sold 150 billion tokens on Binance for $1.14 million, causing the meme coin’s price to fluctuate and drawing attention. PEPE Price Prediction April 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.0000059 and $0.0000088, respectively. The average price might be around $0.0000072. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) April 2025 0.0000059 0.0000072 0.0000088 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000005. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

This is in spite of the Shibarium network crossing an impressive 1 billion transaction mark. Investors are rushing into acquiring over 213 million tokens in the stage three presale of Yeti Ouro ($YETIO) , demonstrating changed priorities towards functional systems as opposed to speculative assets. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB’s Dwindling Trajectory Shiba Inu price is currently at $0.00001063 , its lowest point since February 2024. It is down considerably, having lost as much as 10% over the last 24 hours, in line with market volatility across the board. Technical analysis is heavily biased towards the bear market, with high volumes of trading on the daily, but overwhelmingly due to selling volumes. Significantly, the price drop for SHIB happens even as Shibarium—its L2 network—achieves an important statistic of 1 billion transactions. It has processed in excess of 10.3 million blocks since it launched and sees about 4.4 million daily transactions, making it one of the fastest-growing Ethereum layer-2 networks. Even as whales have collectively acquired 874 billion SHIB tokens in recent declines, seeking possibly long-term hope, the immediate recovery of the price is not happening. SHIB has registered declines in different periods, with weekly drops of -10.25% as well as monthly declines of -24.84%. RSI is sitting just above 35, placing the token at oversold but with strong bear momentum as well. Moving averages are still affirming the downside pressure, with major support at $0.000010 being tested on an ongoing basis. YETIO Pre-Exchange Listing Craze YETIO’s presale has impressed top investors, selling out at its stage three offering for 213 million tokens. It has utility-focused tokenomics as well as a clear vision underpinned by a sophisticated roadmap on top of Ethereum’s platform. What differentiates YETIO is its Play-to-Earn game, Yeti Go, based on Unreal Engine technology. Its virtual racing experience is made possible with in-game YETIO utility for purchases, player rewards, and governance, creating sustainable demand mechanisms for assets that don’t exist in purely speculative ones. YETIO’s token distribution prioritizes community involvement and long-term development: 50% reserved for presale participants 15% allocated towards P2E rewards 15% for user incentives 5% designated for liquidity 5% reserved for token burns 5% on marketing activities 5% for team and advisors The team that worked on the game consists of maestros who have previously worked for acclaimed gaming franchises such as Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. The visuals deliver a cinematic punch, but it’s the sound that truly roots the experience. Designed by audio experts who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, the soundtrack injects each moment with rhythm, intensity, and emotion. Scroll down to meet the game’s lead character and see its world fueled by velocity, attitude, and unshakable style. Right now, a 25% bonus is live for investors buying $500+ YETIO tokens and a 20% bonus on all other purchases. Early bird investors that purchased token in Stage 1 are seeing a 100% ROI with the price increase to $0.024 in Stage 3. Less than 2 weeks remain of the current stage and a steeper price increase has been confirmed for Stage 4. Comparing Macro Aspects Of SHIB And YETIO SHIB’s current performance illustrates the vulnerabilities inherent to speculation-driven assets. Despite Shibarium’s impressive transaction volume and passionate community support, SHIB remains susceptible to market-wide sentiment shifts and macroeconomic factors. YETIO, on the other hand, accesses the $5.61 billion and growing GameFi market by generating inherent value through gameplay interaction. Staking rewards and token burns encourage long-term holding over speculative trading, establishing decidedly different value propositions. What Does the Future Look Like for SHIB and YETIO? Analysts indicate that SHIB prices are likely to probe the key $0.000009 support level before any substantial recovery is on the cards. Whale buying in this period of heightened fear, however, may indicate the possibility of an eventual trend reversal. YETIO’s presale success is proof of the market appetite for developmental-focused projects with clear roadmaps. As markets consolidate, the key question is increasingly evident: short-term price volatility or long-term ecosystem growth.

The new platform combines Orderly’s unified trading infrastructure, deep liquidity , and robust backend with Mode’s user experience model powered by artificial intelligence ( AI ). Currently, Mode Trade features are reserved for Giga stakers with at least 400,000 veMODE, with a limited-access whitelist for additional traders announced for the near future. Mode Trade AI trading features Mode Trade offers a suite of AI tools designed to help individual traders gain the kind of market insight usually reserved for institutional clients. Some of the tools available include, for example, predictive analytics and trade execution via text commands. Arjun Aurora, chief operating officer (COO) at Orderly Network , explained that building on top of Orderly’s infrastructure allowed the team to launch the Mode Trade platform quickly while ensuring deep, cross-chain liquidity from day one. Nikita Monastyrskiy, Growth Lead at Mode, further emphasized the importance of educational tools available on the platform, stating: “In today’s highly volatile market, retail traders often lack access to the predictive analytics and advanced tools that institutional traders rely on. Mode Trade closes this gap by integrating predictive AI directly on the platform, giving everyday traders the ability to stay competitive.” Among the most notable tools are the AI Terminal and Synth forecasting engines, which allow traders to execute their trades with more confidence, even in less favorable market conditions . Further, Mode Trade’s decentralized prediction layer built on Bittensor called Synth feeds directly into the trading terminal, giving users access to over 100 trading pairs, leverage of up to 50x, and Orderly’s synthetic proactive market-making engine (sPMM) for deep liquidity and tight spreads.

On April 1st, at the KPMG offices in Tel Aviv, several dozen people gathered for a meeting of the “CBDC IL Forum” to hear representatives from academia, the Bank of Israel, and KPMG present findings from a study conducted by the Bank of Israel through “Roschink” research institute. The study included around 1,000 participants, and the results were published on the Bank of Israel’s website. In this article, I will review key points from the meeting, comment on the research published by the Bank of Israel, and share what I had said to attendees at the end of the forum meeting. The CBDC IL Forum’s meeting brochure Study: The Israeli Public’s Willingness to Adopt a Digital Shekel Dr. Nir Yaacobi from the Digital Shekel team at the Bank of Israel shared that participants in the study were randomly selected and represent all population segments. “The research institute works with these individuals, and they are paid for their participation,” he said. The amount paid was not disclosed. Prof. Ruth Plato-Shinar, one of the study’s authors, mentioned that the questionnaires were in a digital format. She noted that even people with very basic phones could participate, but acknowledged that those without any digital access likely did not participate and probably don’t understand what a digital shekel is. Analysis of the study document reveals several methodological issues: Sampling method : An online panel was used, meaning participants were already enrolled in digital survey platforms—potentially biasing the sample toward tech-savvy individuals and skewing attitudes about a digital currency. Sample representation : The random sampling underrepresented certain groups, especially Arab citizens. Reweighting was used to correct this by doubling responses of some participants, potentially compromising authenticity. Risks such as loss of privacy, government overreach, and impact on cash economies may be underrepresented due to a bias toward digitally-inclined respondents. Participant dropout : 115 participants dropped out between the first and second questionnaires, which may indicate a selection bias—those more interested in the topic stayed on. Despite efforts to ensure a representative sample, these methodological limitations may affect the study’s validity. Avoiding Disclosure of Digital Shekel Risks At the end of the meeting, I spoke critically about the partial and mainly positive information presented to study participants and the CBDC IL Forum attendees. The public wasn’t exposed to potential risks and limitations of such a system, which I’ve elaborated on in many of my keynote speeches, articles and podcasts . The following video shows that the way the digital shekel was presented to study participants was lacking. The description of the digital shekel and its system focused on the advantages, as read by Prof. Plato-Shinar at the CBDC IL forum meeting: In addition, the study does not comprehensively address potential risks for end users—such as the possibility of state control over financial behavior, loss of privacy, asset seizure, use of the currency as a surveillance tool, restricted access to funds due to regulatory decisions, and more. The lack of emphasis on these risks is especially problematic for individuals concerned about government overreach and privacy violations, but also for those who are simply unaware of the potential dangers and their implications. The study does mention: Limited privacy claims : It is stated that “the central bank will not have access to identified information about balances and transactions in users’ wallets,” but also that privacy levels will be defined according to user type—which implies that privacy is not absolute. Enforcement capabilities and restrictions : “The system will support the implementation and enforcement of restrictions” on wallet balances, which could indicate the potential for usage limitations. The digital shekel is being designed with technical capabilities to impose limits on wallet balances—meaning it will be possible to define how much money a person is allowed to hold in their digital wallet and monitor that in real time. Although the document does not specify who would be authorized to enforce these limitations, the mere existence of enforcement capabilities indicates a control mechanism that could theoretically allow freezes, blocks, or other restrictions on usage—raising questions about financial freedom, privacy, and institutional power. Government control : The Bank of Israel will be “the sole authority empowered to issue and redeem the digital shekel,” meaning there will be no decentralized alternatives like cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Implications for Cash-Based Communities The study does refer to the level of interest among different population groups and notes that among the ultra-Orthodox community, interest in the digital shekel is among the lowest. However, it does not explicitly discuss the consequences of transitioning to a digital currency for communities that rely heavily on cash. The digital shekel may pose a significant challenge to these groups if cash usage is eventually curtailed. Possible reasons for low interest among the Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) community: Clear preference for cash : Most Haredim use cash due to privacy concerns, a desire to avoid dependence on banks, and some hold traditional opposition to modern financial systems. Digital literacy gaps : Financial digital literacy in parts of the ultra-Orthodox community is lower than the general population. Fear of regulatory control : Cash offers a degree of economic independence, whereas a digital shekel may increase government control over payments. Senior Citizens In 2023, the Israeli Internet Society conducted a survey among Israelis aged 65 and older. It found that approximately 30% do not use the internet at all , and “it can be said that at least some of them have not bridged the access gap.” This population segment (60+) comprises around 25.3% of Israel’s total population ( data from 2020). This is another example of a group whose access to technology is limited—and therefore will likely also be limited in their ability to use a digital shekel. Since the study was conducted digitally, that 30% segment of this population likely was not represented in the sample. That said, only 13% of the study participants were aged 60+ (13% in the first survey and 12% in the second), meaning people aged 60 and over were underrepresented in the sample—at about half their proportion in the general population. This raises several concerns: Digital exclusion : A significant portion of those aged 65+ simply could not participate in the survey. Overestimated tech readiness : If only elderly people with digital skills participated, the study may overestimate interest among the elderly. Accessibility gaps : People who struggle with technology may also struggle to use the digital shekel—but their perspectives were not captured. All of these factors may introduce bias that should be taken into account when interpreting the findings. To achieve a more accurate picture, the researchers could have incorporated other research methods (such as phone or in-person interviews) to reach those without digital access. What’s New in the World of CBDCs At the meeting, Ben Benakot of KPMG Israel presented developments in the CBDC space. He noted that most countries in the world are exploring CBDC solutions at various stages, and that 65 countries are in advanced research stages . One case study he presented was Brazil, where the central bank launched the PIX retail payment system during the COVID-19 period. It saw rapid adoption. Today, Brazil’s central bank is working on DREX, a wholesale CBDC system, and has completed a collaboration with Meta to enable payments via WhatsApp using PIX. Ben pointed out that no advanced Western countries have launched CBDC systems yet—likely one reason the Bank of Israel is not rushing to make a decision. The Bank of Israel has previously stated it is monitoring the EU central bank as a model. Balancing the Narrative on the EU and China In my closing statements at the CBDC IL forum meeting, I also referred to a study conducted recently in the EU with less than flattering results; This study was clearly not mentioned by any of the forum’s experts. I found it important to balance the overly positive narrative and bring the following to attendees’ attention: On March 12, the European Central Bank (ECB) published a working paper titled “Consumer Attitudes Toward CBDC,” surveying approximately 19,000 respondents across 11 Eurozone countries. The report highlighted significant communication challenges that are expected to hinder adoption of the digital euro. It found that Europeans show little interest in a digital euro, strongly prefer existing payment methods, and see no real added value in a new payment system given the many alternatives. Nevertheless, the European Central Bank recently announced that it will begin the rollout of the digital euro in October 2025 , pending regulatory approvals. Read more about the EU’s CBDC plans in my recent article, ECB Prepping the Ground for Digital Euro Launch . Furthermore (at the CBDC IL meeting), I went on to explain that the high adoption rate of the CBDC in China is not necessarily a result of public enthusiasm, but rather of a top-down market strategy led by the central bank—a “If you can’t beat them, join them” approach. In the early years of the e-CNY (China’s CBDC), the project was considered a failure due to low adoption. Eventually, the central bank instructed major retail and tech companies to integrate e-CNY into their most popular apps (DiDi, Meituan, Ctrip, WeChat Pay, and Alipay)—a move that enabled wide adoption. Today, the e-CNY has about 180 million digital wallet users and a cumulative transaction volume of $1 trillion. The Trust Factor 70% of Israel’s study participants expressed trust in the Bank of Israel. At the meeting, Ben Benakot of KPMG commented on the trust issue: “If we don’t trust the government, this becomes a problematic issue, because theoretically, CBDCs give the state more data.” Benakot noted that although the Bank of Israel is designing the system so that it won’t have direct access to user information—only authorized payment providers will—there’s no guarantee that a future government won’t change the system and gain direct access to accounts and personal data. He also mentioned that today, for example, the Israeli tax authority already has the ability to monitor financial data on citizens (albeit not immediately or directly due to oversight). In theory, the digital shekel is not very different. Public Awareness and Messaging Another point I raised at the meeting was the Bank of Israel’s responsibility to inform the public in a fair, honest, and balanced way. I asked: if the Bank truly seeks to understand the public’s willingness to adopt the digital shekel—why hasn’t it launched a nationwide campaign like it did during Covid-19, when the government mobilized all its resources to educate the public through experts, influencers, media, social platforms, billboards, and more? Why, unlike during Covid, isn’t the Bank of Israel making an effort to present the full picture—including the risks and downsides—not just the flattering, positive aspects? As someone with about 20 years of experience in marketing, I also pointed out the haste with which the Bank moved from releasing the study and press announcement, to publishing a post the very next day (!) on social media (Instagram, Facebook) stating: “51% of the public wants a digital shekel.” Every beginner marketer knows that when you highlight the yes, you obscure the no. Yes, there’s interest—but what about the other 49%? The post read: “Most of the public sees the benefits: easy to use, convenient, and protected from fraud.” Most of the public? Based on a 1,000-person study where 51% expressed interest? It also states: “No final decision has been made, but it seems the future is already here.” That sounds like the decision’s already been made—only the launch date is missing. Conclusion Dr. Nir Yaacobi from the Bank of Israel’s Digital Shekel team said at the meeting: “We’re entering uncharted territory, and we don’t currently have a strategy”—referring to which digital financial solution will be chosen in Israel. “We’re working on three fronts: a digital shekel (CBDC), stablecoins, and tokenized commercial bank deposits.” He added: “Maybe we’ll go with one solution—like the digital shekel—or maybe all three. If we launch a wholesale CBDC, legislation likely won’t be needed. If it’s retail—yes.” After I finished my remarks, Assaf David-Margalit from the Digital Shekel team responded and said that some of what I said was accurate—but most of it was not. When I asked what wasn’t accurate, I received no response. My invitation to Mr. David-Margalit to respond with specific clarifications remains open. To conclude: I believe it is vital to raise public awareness around the digital shekel, because clearly “the future is already here.” For that reason, it is essential to openly present both the risks and benefits of a digital shekel system so that an informed public can participate meaningfully in the conversation and make relevant choices about their lives.

The sharp recovery came in response to an unexpected shift in macroeconomic policy: US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries—except China, which now faces a steep 125% tariff. The news sent a ripple through global markets, sparking a short-term rally in risk assets, including crypto.

Ethereum, which had been under heavy selling pressure for weeks, appears to have found temporary relief. According to Glassnode data, long-term Ethereum holders are starting to fold, offloading positions at a loss after months of decline. Historically, these moments of long-term holder capitulation have often marked bottoming phases and preceded meaningful rebounds. While short-term volatility remains elevated, some analysts view this setup as a potential opportunity zone, especially for contrarian investors looking to accumulate during peak fear. The market now watches to see if ETH can hold its gains or if broader uncertainty will drag prices back down. One thing is clear: the next few days could be pivotal for Ethereum’s trend heading into the second half of 2025. Ethereum Finds Relief Amid Chaos, But Market Remains On Edge Ethereum is now at a pivotal crossroads after enduring weeks of relentless selling pressure and uncertainty. The recent surge from sub-$1,400 levels has offered a glimmer of hope, as bulls begin to push back against the downtrend. This bounce follows aggressive volatility not just in crypto but across global equities, with price action rocked by continued geopolitical unrest and macroeconomic instability. US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable stance on tariffs remains a wildcard, keeping global markets on edge. Since peaking in late December, Ethereum has shed over 60% of its value, triggering growing concern that a full-scale bear market may be unfolding. Many investors have already exited positions, while others remain sidelined waiting for clarity. Still, some see opportunity. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, long-term Ethereum holders have now entered what’s commonly referred to as “capitulation” mode—a stage when even the most patient investors begin to fold under pressure. Martinez believes this could present a rare window for contrarian buyers. “For those watching risk-reward dynamics, this phase has historically marked prime accumulation zones,” he shared on X. While Ethereum’s path forward is still uncertain, current sentiment suggests that a critical test is underway—one that could determine whether this recovery has legs, or if further pain lies ahead.

Bulls Look To Confirm Recovery With Key Breakout Ethereum is showing signs of short-term strength as it forms an “Adam & Eve” bullish reversal pattern on the 4-hour chart. This classic technical formation, which starts with a sharp V-shaped low followed by a rounded bottom, often signals a potential breakout if price action holds and follows through. For Ethereum, reclaiming the $1,820 level is the first step to confirm this bullish structure. If bulls can push ETH above this level with conviction, the next key challenge lies at the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both of which converge around the $1,900 mark. A decisive breakout through this zone would validate the recovery setup and could kickstart a more sustained move higher.

However, failure to reclaim the $1,800 level in the coming days may keep ETH stuck in a consolidation range. If rejected, price could remain rangebound between current levels and the lower support area near $1,300, where ETH recently bounced. For now, all eyes are on how price reacts to the resistance levels ahead, as bulls aim to regain control and shift the short-term momentum in their favor.

The S&P 500 opened 2% lower on Thursday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 715 points, or -1.76%, following futures that signaled a slight pullback. The negative open reflected investor sentiment as markets digested the evolving tariff environment—jitters around the U.S.–China trade war and its broader economic impact dominated premarket trading. Although the historic rally for U.S. indexes had extended into broader risk asset markets, the S&P 500 futures had fallen 2.07%. Dow futures gave up 636 points, or about -1.56%, while futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 tumbled 2.54%. At the open, the Nasdaq extended losses to 3% in early trades, with Apple and Tesla shares declining more than 3% and 5%, respectively. Nvidia also dipped sharply, down 4.9% at open, while Meta Platforms dropped 3.7%. These declines across the major indexes came after historic rallies on April 9. But experts, including economist Mohamed El-Erian urge caution. US CPI inflation for March was better (lower) than the consensus forecasts — across the board. The monthly price changes came in at -0.1% for headline and 0.1% for core.

It showed that inflation eased to 2.4% , falling 0.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis. This compares to February’s 2.8%, marking the slowest core inflation growth month-over-month since March 2021. While March’s CPI report suggests U.S. inflation pressures decreased considerably month over month in March, tariffs concerns loom. The inflation report came out just a day after President Donald Trump provided a massive upside injection for markets with the 90-day pause to reciprocal tariffs. Markets responded positively to the pause, though analysts noted that the newly announced 125% tariffs on Chinese goods remained a looming concern. While the White House is open to negotiation during the 90-day window, uncertainty over China’s response is weighing on investor sentiment.

While the market expects the FED to start reducing interest rates as soon as possible in order for Bitcoin and altcoins to rise again, Wall Street giants are calling on the FED to make an urgent interest rate cut. But famed economist Nouriel Roubini, known as “Dr. Doom” for his accurate predictions about the 2008 global financial crisis, has issued a new warning for Wall Street. Roubini, who is also a professor at New York University and a prominent Bitcoin skeptic, warned investors not to rely on the Fed to quickly resolve the financial market instability triggered by Trump's tariffs. Speaking to Bloomberg, Roubini said investors should temper their expectations of a Fed savior and warned that investors expecting a swift Fed intervention could be disappointed. FED Will Wait for Trump to Take the First Step! The famous economist stated that FED Chairman Jerome Powell will intervene to stabilize the market, but will do so after Trump takes the first step and softens his rhetoric. Roubini also said he expects the Fed to keep rates steady for the rest of the year once policy battles over tariffs subside and the U.S. economy avoids a recession. He added that investors expecting the Fed to intervene quickly may be disappointed, and that we should not rely on the Fed to resolve the financial market instability caused by Trump's international trade tariffs. Powell is likely to wait until Trump softens his actions and then intervene to stabilize market volatility. *This is not investment advice.

However, after gains on the day by $ETH and $SOL of 12.4% and 13.2% respectively, both layer 1 cryptocurrencies have dropped more than 4% on Thursday. Where are they going next? Market drops on better than expected CPI data release Before going on to analyse the price action for $ETH and $SOL, it has to be taken into consideration that the Trump tariffs are not done yet, and that the U.S. CPI data has just been released. On this note, the CPI data makes generally positive reading . The month on month reading for Core CPI is 0.1% from a forecast 0.3%, while the year on year reading for CPI is 2.4%, which is better than the 2.5% forecast. Unemployment claims were exactly as expected at 223K, which is slightly up from the previous figure of 219K. All this said, the crypto market is down on the news. Is this because of ongoing tariffs fallout, or could it be that market makers are using the news to counter-trade the positive sentiment? $ETH downtrend continues Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $ETH shows the tumbling descent for the price. A higher high and low must be put in, and soon, in order to arrest the descent. Wednesday’s pump succeeded in taking the price back to the descending trendline, but unless it pushes through and confirms above, it will be to no avail. That said, the price may just be coming back to confirm the retaking of the horizontal support at $1,600. For the downtrend to start reversing, the bulls will need to break through the descending trendline, and make a new higher high above $1,960. Could the tide be about to turn for $ETH? Source: TradingView The weekly timeframe for $ETH shows that the price is currently holding to the very important $1,600 horizontal support. A candle wick through, and down to $1,400, which incidentally marks the top of the 2017/2018 bull market, signals that the bulls are serious about defending this level. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index on the weekly has reached the third lowest point in $ETH’s history. Is the tide about to turn? This may be in the hands of a certain U.S. president. $SOL bulls attempt to arrest precipitous slide Source: TradingView The 8-hour time frame for $SOL is similar to that of $ETH, with a fairly precipitous slide leaving a trail of lower highs and lower lows in its wake. Just having been rejected from the trendline once again, the bulls are currently seeking to make the $112 resistance a support again. $SOL price between critical support and resistance levels Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $SOL displays the vital horizontal support at $94, and also the critical narrow band of resistance that stretches from $112 up to $122. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI shows that the indicator lines are dragging along the bottom. While this could persist, the lines will turn up sooner or later. If they can get above the 20.00 level, this would signal strong upside price momentum. A big catalyst to ignite markets For both of these leading layer 1 networks, any future rally will very much depend on the health of the market in general. With just one announcement on Wednesday, President Trump was able to stop the slide in global markets. Could a big catalyst be around the corner? Could this be something along the lines of a deal with China? Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Top Bitcoin miners produced nearly $800 million of BTC in Q1 2025 The largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies produced nearly $800 million worth of Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting continued growth across the sector as Bitcoin prices held near record highs. According to publicly available data compiled by Cointelegraph, the top Bitcoin mining companies produced over 9,700 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the first quarter. With Bitcoin trading at around $81,600 at the time of writing, the total production was valued at around $800 million. Marathon Digital, the biggest Bitcoin mining company by market capitalization, led the pack with 2,285 Bitcoin (worth roughly $186 million) mined in Q1. CleanSpark followed with 1,950 BTC mined in Q1, valued near $160 million. CleanSpark’s March performance also saw a 13.4% increase month-on-month. On April 3, Marathon announced that it produced 829 BTC in March, up 17.4% from February and 10.5% higher than January. Iren, formerly Iris Energy, produced the third-highest amount for the quarter. The mining firm reported a total of 1,513 BTC, worth almost $124 million. US Senate confirms Paul Atkins to lead Trump’s SEC The US Senate on April 9 confirmed US President Donald Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins, as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission in a 52-44 vote largely along party lines. Trump named the pro-crypto former Wall Street consultant to lead the agency late last year, who was also an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008. Atkins founded the financial consulting firm Patomak Global Partners after he left the SEC in 2009 and served as co-chair of the crypto advocacy group Token Alliance between 2017 and late 2024. After he’s sworn in, Atkins will follow on from former chair Gary Gensler, whose tenure saw the agency launch multiple lawsuits and investigations against crypto firms over alleged breaches of securities laws. Atkins is expected to take a different approach. He said at a Senate confirmation hearing in March that a top priority of his time at the SEC would be “to provide a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets through a rational, coherent, and principled approach.” Trump pauses some tariffs, boosts China’s United States President Donald Trump issued a 90-day pause on ""reciprocal tariffs"" and lowered the tariff rate to 10% on countries that do not retaliate with counter-tariffs. The president also said he would increase the reciprocal tariff rate on China to 125% due to the country's counter-tariffs against the US. Trump wrote in an April 9 Truth Social post : ""At some point, hopefully, in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA, and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable."" According to data from TradingView, the S&P 500 index rallied close to 7% following the announcement, showcasing the high volatility of capital markets amid the macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential for a protracted trade conflict .

PEPE Rockets Up 14% in a Day,https://cryptonews.com/news/should-you-buy-meme-coins-now-pepe-surges-14-in-a-day/,"Global investment markets are ripping on the back of Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, and meme coins like Pepe have responded fast, jumping 14% on the daily. The return of risk-on sentiment has sparked a wave of dip-buying. PEPE is still down 44% from its pre-tariff war levels just over two months ago, giving it a claim in the “best cryptos to buy now” conversation. Crypto Surges: Should You ‘Buy the Dip’ on Meme Coins? Since the tariff war began in early February, risk assets like crypto have become increasingly vulnerable to volatility under heavy market FUD. And when crypto bleeds, meme coins often bleed more. Their speculative nature has dragged the meme coin market down 52.5% over the period, now sitting at a $44 billion market cap. Meme coin market cap post-tariff war. Source: CoinMarketCap. But that same volatility cuts both ways. Today meme coins are outperforming, up 7.56% to the broader crypto market’s 5.52%—they are soaking up fresh retail liquidity. PEPE Price Analysis: Is This the Bottom? Today’s reversal suggests a potential bottom, with a successful retest of a long-term support zone that has guided lows since mid-2024. PEPE / USDT 1-week chart, impending falling wedge pattern breakout. Source: Binance. PEPE now approaches a confluence zone, where this support intersects with the resistance that has capped upside attempts throughout its 4-month downtrend. This sets the stage for a potential break from the resistance—part of a falling wedge pattern that guided price movements since early December. Momentum indicators back this outlook. The MACD line is reversing into an uptrend, closing in on a golden cross with the signal line—suggesting selling pressure is weakening. More so, the RSI is showing early signs of recovery, climbing toward 40 after spending the past month stuck near the oversold threshold. If buying pressure persists, a pattern breakout targets highs around $0.00002, marking a 190% gain from current levels. But in the near term, PEPE could first retest February’s high of $0.00001—a 50% move from here.

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has picked up the pace amidst the uptrend in the market. Betwixt the turn of events, marketers are still hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently holding onto its support/resistance at $0.1551, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.159. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.153 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same? Worry not, Coinpedia’s Dogecoin price prediction 2025 to 2030 will clear all such doubts. Look at this well-researched and detailed DOGE price prediction for the upcoming moves.

That’s not all, Dogecoin witnessed an impressive 400% spike in its active addresses, hinting at growing network activity. If the FOMO around Dogecoin continues to grow and if influencers promote the coin, then its price could reach $1.07 . However, if Dogecoin cannot maintain its current growth rate, its price will likely average out at $0.84 in a highly competitive market. On the other hand, if Dogecoin fails to stay relevant in 2025, the price of DOGE can plunge to a low of $0.62 .

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025.

Hermetica, the issuer of the Bitcoin-backed stablecoin USDh, has partnered with Velar to offer a 5% annual yield to traders using Velar’s perpetual futures exchange on the Bitcoin Layer 2 network, Stacks ( STX ), according to a release shared with crypto.news. The new feature allows users to earn yield on USDh while trading leveraged Bitcoin ( BTC ) positions.

Typically, when traders deposit stablecoins to open leveraged positions on futures platforms, the collateral sits idle. Now, users trading on Velar PerpDEX with USDh can earn a weekly yield on that collateral, without needing to stake or lock up their funds elsewhere. Earn 5% USDh yield while trading on @VelarBTC 's PerpDEX! This is one of a kind in DeFi, trade Bitcoin with leverage while earning a passive yield. Now exclusively on the sBTC/USDh pair. If you’re not in yet, what are you waiting for? 👀 pic.twitter.com/Ugm4ga7Csl — Hermetica (@HermeticaFi) April 10, 2025 Perpetual futures are a type of crypto derivative that lets traders speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Traders can go long or short using leverage, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Velar PerpDEX brings this kind of trading to Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem via the Stacks network, which adds smart contract functionality on top of Bitcoin. USDh is a synthetic stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by Bitcoin. Unlike most stablecoins, which are backed by traditional fiat reserves, USDh is supported by BTC and designed to earn yield automatically. Hermetica says it is the first stablecoin to offer yield in Bitcoin-native DeFi. The new integration is designed to make capital use more efficient for traders. It offers a way to earn passive income from stable collateral while actively trading BTC, potentially attracting more users to the still-nascent world of Bitcoin-based DeFi.

Crypto derivatives remained more resilient, finishing the month with a smaller contraction. In March, centralized trading for all crypto assets slowed down, following the overall trend of losing volumes for the whole of Q1. Derivative trading proved more resilient, only contracting by 5%. Centralized exchanges brought in global traffic, though mostly from crypto-friendly regions. The March outflow reflected bearish attitudes and outflows from the South Korean market, as well as the US market. Binance’s traffic and activity reflected robust levels of interest from other global markets. Spot trading lost 16.6% despite inflows from whales and selling pressure for Bitcoin (BTC), as well as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Spot exchanges also carried smaller liquidity in the form of stablecoins, while most of the extra liquidity still supported derivative trading. In March, stablecoins on all centralized exchanges declined, with the total balance sinking from over 48B down to 45B tokens. US-based traders drive exchange outflows for spot volume and crypto derivatives The loss of momentum affected mostly three exchanges – Crypto.com (down by 43.9%), Bybit (down by 52.6%), and Bitfinex (down by 31.1%). Some of the spot trading traffic moved to HTX, increasing volumes by 29.4% for the month. Derivative exchange activity moved back to Kraken, up by 28.3% for March. The traffic moved from Crypto.com, which lost 39.3% of derivative activity. Both Crypto.com and Coinbase lost traffic, signaling an outflow of US-based traders. Despite this, US-based markets remained the most liquid for the first quarter of 2025 . Traffic to crypto exchanges only declined by 3% in the past month. The exchange activity on spot and derivative markets is also not sorted based on market makers or bots. Some of the more dramatic trading spikes may be anomalies or deliberate bot-driven trades. Exchanges also separated themselves based on regional traffic inflows. Binance saw relatively small outflows while taking traffic from India, Vietnam, and Korea. Coinbase, on the other hand, reflected the lost confidence of US traders, erasing the effect of the US Presidential elections. The outflow of spot traders is also noted on DEX markets. Currently, decentralized markets make up around 10% of CEX spot trading. Despite this, the volatile market presented opportunities for risky decentralized bets. In March and early April, Hyperliquid turned into one of the busiest DEXs by daily volumes . Binance retains the liveliest asset flows Binance was one of the centralized markets with the most active asset flows. The CEX is one of the main venues for derivative trading, seeing some of the largest daily liquidations. Based on open positions, Binance remains a proxy for the entire derivative and futures market . The CEX is also a benchmark for spot volumes, with over 29.5% of the entire market including small and niche exchanges. For spot volumes, Binance was a leader, with over 60% of all activity against a shortlist of other large exchanges, based on data by Newshedge. Binance remained a leader among centralized exchanges for both spot and crypto derivatives activity. | Source: IntoTheBlock The CEX also saw the liveliest inflows of BTC, ETH, and stablecoins. The exchange carries more constant balances with a robust supply of coins and tokens. In March, Binance saw a net outflow of BTC, but is now recovering the available balance. Despite the ongoing activity, March was the slowest month of the year so far. Binance dominated all other exchanges in terms of trading volumes, but the overall activity followed the weakening performance from January and February.

Through a letter on April 9 to Commissioner Hester Peirce, the lawyers of OpenSea urged the SEC to formally state that websites like OpenSea would not be treated as exchanges or brokers under federal securities law. Legal Argument: NFT Marketplaces Don’t Fit the Mold OpenSea’s deputy general counsel Laura Brookover and general counsel Adele Faure argued that NFT marketplaces do not fit within the legal definition of exchanges or brokers. Unlike traditional financial platforms, OpenSea does not execute transactions, hold customer assets, or facilitate trading in the same securities among various buyers and sellers. “We request the Commission to remove this uncertainty and maintain the ability of U.S. tech companies to lead in this field,” the letter stated, highlighting the need for legal certainty not to foreclose innovation. Request for Informal Guidance and Broader Exemption Faure and Brookover sought informal advice from the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, similar to recent comments excluding stablecoins and memecoins from securities classifications. They petitioned that NFTs—like those OpenSea sells—be treated as collectibles, not financial instruments. They also sought exemption from proposed broker registration rules, stating that OpenSea does not provide investment advice or custody user funds. Regulatory Shift Underway The SEC has shown a retreat from its previous hardline stance towards crypto regulation, particularly under the Trump administration. Several enforcement actions have been retracted, such as one against OpenSea itself. This has made the environment more friendly to crypto firms, though regulatory ambiguity remains a concern. Industry Implications OpenSea warned that unresolved regulatory questions could threaten the formation of U.S.-based digital asset companies. The company’s plea for transparency is part of a broader industry push to keep NFTs beyond the reach of traditional financial regulations.",NFT|Sticky|Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-10 15:23:00

The new system is designed to facilitate fund managers' and investors' management of tokenized assets across multiple blockchains using a single interface. The roll-out begins with a $230 million fund from Anemoy, a crypto-native asset manager powered by Centrifuge. The fund invests in U.S. Treasury securities managed by Janus Henderson and marks one of the larger real-world asset tokenizations to date. Centrifuge V3 introduces “full chain abstraction,” which allows users to invest, administer, and issue tokenized assets without directly interacting with blockchain infrastructure, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. Wormhole, a popular cross-chain bridge, powers the interoperability. Its role in the partnership is to ensure that tokenized assets on Centrifuge are fully composable — usable in decentralized finance and institutional platforms alike.

Tether's recent minting of 1 billion USDT on the Tron network signals continued institutional interest despite market volatility. Technical Analysis Highlights TRX recovered from a 7.5% correction, rebounding from 0.221 on April 7th to reach 0.243 by April 10th. A clear double-bottom pattern formed around the 0.226-0.227 support zone, with significantly increased volume during the recovery phase, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The 48-hour analysis shows a decisive uptrend with higher lows and higher highs, establishing strong support at 0.238 and resistance at 0.242. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate the current rally has reclaimed the 61.8% level of the previous decline. Momentum indicators point to continued bullish sentiment as TRX approaches the key psychological level of 0.245. In the last 100 minutes of trading, TRX gained 0.6% from 0.241 to 0.242, forming a clear ascending channel pattern. Strong buying pressure occurred between 10:52-10:58, with TRX surging from 0.241 to 0.242 on higher-than-average volume. A brief pullback to 0.241 around 11:15 established a higher low, maintaining uptrend integrity. Fibonacci extension suggests 0.243 as the next target level, with immediate support at 0.241.

Similarly, in ancient crypto times, circa 2017, blockchain technology stood to revolutionize finance and other fields. But two challenges stood in the way of this technology enjoying its full potential: (1) securities laws that don’t easily map onto decentralized systems, and (2) a securities regulator hostile to digital assets, which often posed grave risks to those who tried to solve the first challenge. Today, the sphinx has resolved to be more helpful, but the riddles remain. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Crypto Task Force has stated that the agency’s previous regime created “an environment hostile to innovation” and has committed to working with industry participants to craft sensible regulations. While promising, significant challenges remain. U.S. securities laws are a mix of statutes passed by Congress and rules adopted by the SEC. The Task Force has signaled the SEC’s willingness to make the latter more workable through new rules and exemptions. Statutes, however, present most of the challenges and only Congress, not the SEC, can change them. Below is a primer on the more common riddles currently facing developers of tokenized securities. Regulatory Considerations For tokenized securities, the developer creates on-chain tokens that each represent a share of equity in a company or other security, or another asset that offers the right to cashflows. This tokenization can open up possibilities—such as instantaneous settlement, share fractionalization, and daily dividend payments—that make the product more efficient or functionally diverse than its TradFi counterpart. Even though the SEC may be more receptive to ideas for tokenized securities, it doesn’t have the authority to change statutes. Tokenized securities projects, therefore, will still need to solve or avoid the riddles these statutes present. The Investment Company Act If a token gives its holder economic exposure to assets that the developer has pooled, that token project could be an investment company covered by the Investment Company Act, which regulates companies, like mutual funds, that invest in securities and let investors get exposure to those investments through shares that they issue. This riddle existed well before crypto, and most opted to navigate it by avoiding being classified as an investment company in the first place. That’s because the requirements imposed by the Investment Company Act don’t work well with business models that involve more than the buying and selling of securities. There are substantial restrictions on debt and equity raises, borrowing, and even business with affiliates. For those unable to avoid triggering these requirements, there are exemptions that may be available. Broker-Dealers Under the Securities Exchange Act Anyone who buys and sells securities for others or stands ready to buy and sell securities for their own account may be a broker or dealer. There is no bright line rule for qualifying as a broker-dealer, but the SEC and courts consider as indicia whether you provide liquidity, charge a fee related to the trade price, actively find investors, or play a role in holding customer funds or securities. While there’s no practical way to trade digital assets as a broker-dealer currently, the SEC could use its existing authority to chart a realistic path for doing so. In the best case, that will take time and still come with some compliance obligations. Exchanges Under the Securities Exchange Act While it may not look like a traditional securities exchange, a platform using smart contracts to bring together orders for tokenized securities from multiple buyers and multiple sellers for matching and execution could qualify as one, depending on its structure. Currently, only broker-dealers can trade on exchanges, and exchanges can’t hold customer accounts or custody customer securities. Even if the SEC is able to rework these rules, some requirements would no doubt persist. Security-Based Swaps Under the Securities Exchange Act If a tokenized security gives its holder exposure to the economic performance of one or more securities, it may have crossed over into the complicated world of security-based swaps. Generally, tokens that provide for the exchange of future payments based on the value of a security (or events relating to that security) without conveying ownership rights are likely to be swaps. Security-based swaps are under the joint jurisdiction of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The requirements for them are many, with the most notable being rules prohibiting retail investors from purchasing swaps. AML and KYC Companies involved in trading or transferring tokenized securities also need to consider the applicability of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws. Compliance requirements depend on the role being played in the transactions but can include collecting and verifying the name, birthdate, and address of customers. The Riddles Must Be Worked Through, Not Around Solving these riddles is not an end in itself. When designing any tokenized securities project, developers make choices based on the economics, the technology, and the regulatory framework. These areas are intertwined, as the technology can make the economics possible and decide where a project falls within the regulatory framework. But because these considerations are so interrelated, developers should analyze them holistically from the beginning. Leaving regulatory considerations for the end can turn into a game of Jenga where problematic parts are removed only to topple the benefits of and objectives for the economics and technology. The riddles posed today aren’t merely obstacles to the many advantages of blockchain technology, but crucial parts of the answer.

The crypto analyst known as Doctor Profit, who previously warned of a correction when Bitcoin was approaching $97,000, recently released a new technical outlook that dissuades a bullish trajectory in the short term. In a breakdown shared on the social media platform X, Doctor Profit noted that the breakdown isn’t complete yet. This outlook comes from a former detailed analysis in which the analyst highlighted various Bitcoin price movements to watch out for, all of which have come to pass. Doctor Profit Says Bitcoin Market Dump Is Just Beginning Bitcoin has experienced ups and downs in the past few days with incredibly volatile movements. These ups and downs saw the Bitcoin price fall below $75,000 at the beginning of the week before spending the past four days on a recovery path towards $80,000. Amidst the price volatility, crypto analyst Doctor Profit clarified that he expects the current downward move in Bitcoin’s price to extend further. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns Of Volume Drop That Could Trigger 60% Bitcoin Price Crash To $49,000 In a recent post on social media platform X, the analyst described the correction as a “market massacre” that is expected to continue, stating that the party just started. He revealed that he had placed his first buy orders within the $58,000 to $68,000 range, suggesting that the Bitcoin price would keep falling until it reaches this region. Rather than seeing the recent decline as a setback, the price action is a calculated part of the broader strategy which the analyst laid out in an earlier detailed analysis. Doctor Profit’s analysis is based on the M2 money supply, a macroeconomic metric he believes is widely misunderstood within the crypto space. Many traders have recently cited the uptick in M2 as a bullish signal for Bitcoin, assuming that more liquidity means an immediate surge in prices. However, the analyst stressed that timing is everything. He noted that Bitcoin tends to front-run traditional markets when responding to M2 increases, but even then, the reaction is not instantaneous. What To Expect With BTC He reminds his followers that in July 2024, he predicted a 50bps rate cut, which was considered highly unlikely at the time. Once that cut materialized in September, around the same time Bitcoin was hovering near $50,000, he labeled it extremely bullish and called for a major rally. As it turned out, the M2 money supply began expanding in February 2025, which aligned with his forecast. Yet, he cautions that while M2 is now climbing, its effect on Bitcoin will play out gradually. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Mirrors Global M2 As Crypto Analyst Reveals May Timeline For “Blast Off” Looking at Bitcoin’s price behavior on the charts, Doctor Profit shifted his focus to the $70,000 to $74,000 range. He believes this range could either serve as a springboard for a fresh upward rally if a strong daily close occurs above the “Golden Line” around the weekly EMA50 or as a signal for a deeper downside if the price breaks beneath it. Should a more dramatic breakdown occur, the analyst advised scaling back and waiting for even lower entries around the $50,000 to $60,000 zone. Doctor Profit predicted that the bull run will not resume until sometime around May or June, with upside targets of $120,000 to $140,000. Bitcoin has managed to push above $81,000 after Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on his ground-breaking tarriffs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $82,000, up by 7% in the past 24 hours.

Updates posted on X on Wednesday, April 9, 2025, disclosed that Griffith is now starting his return to civilian life after serving some of his sentence for violating US sanctions. Ethereum Developer’s Prison Release Confirmed By Sources Brantly Milegan, executive director of Ethereum Identity Foundation, broke the news with a photo of Griffith and his parents outside the prison. Alexander Urbelis, ENS general counsel and part of Griffith’s legal team, confirmed his release from FCI Milan in Michigan. VIRGIL GRIFFITH IS OUT OF PRISON!!! just released this morning! he’ll be in a halfway house for a few weeks, and parole after that with work restrictions (so a pardon is still important), but HE IS OUT pic.twitter.com/Q4jRZmryGk — brantly.eth (@BrantlyMillegan) April 9, 2025 Griffith was arrested in November 2019 after speaking at a cryptocurrency conference in North Korea. Prosecutors claimed his presentation provided information that could help North Korea evade sanctions and launder money. From 63 Months To 56: The Sentence Journey In 2022, Griffith was sentenced to 63 months in prison and meted a fine of $100,000 after pleading guilty to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In July 2024, US District Judge Kevin Castel lowered his sentence to 56 months, citing him as a first-time offender. Crypto Return Faces Serious Hurdles Griffith himself starts a several-year probation term. His attorneys are fighting to transfer him from the halfway house to home confinement, but returning to regular life is hindered. The Department of Commerce placed severe export restrictions on Virgil that will extend until 2032, Urbelis explained. These limits could block his return to the cryptocurrency field. Presidential Pardon Possibility Under Trump Administration Before joining Ethereum, Griffith earned a Ph.D. from Caltech and created WikiScanner, a tool tracking anonymous Wikipedia edits. He also worked with Aaron Swartz on Tor2web. According to Urbelis, Griffith is seeking a pardon from US President Donald Trump. Trump has previously granted clemency to others in crypto-related cases, including Ross Ulbricht and Arthur Hayes. The case has triggered debate about sharing open-source information versus helping sanctioned nations. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has supported Griffith, even signing a petition calling for his release in 2023.

The Finance Ministry now projects a 2% GDP increase in 2025, down from the earlier 2.3% estimate. Officials noted that weak exports are slowing overall growth, while household spending remains the main driver of expansion. Finance ministry warns Trump’s tariffs could further slow Czech economy to 1.6% The updated forecast accounts for the impact of previous U.S. tariffs on EU automobile, steel, and aluminum exports but does not factor in President Donald Trump’s more recently announced and subsequently suspended tariffs. A chief economist of the Finance Ministry, David Prusvic, predicted that the uncertain status of international trade will negatively impact corporate spending plans in one of Europe’s most export-dependent economies. Furthermore, in line with reports from sources, Prusvic clarified that their companies’ investment strategies were based on domestic and international economic trends, especially those in the euro area. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic’s primary industries are auto parts and automobile manufacturing, with exports to the EU accounting for around 80% of the nation’s GDP. However, investors are worried about the fate of Trump’s recent tariffs. The Finance Ministry’s recent findings make the situation even worse. According to the ministry, Czech economic growth could drop further to around 1.6% this year if those tariffs are implemented. While the full impact remains uncertain, the ministry suggested that Germany’s proposed fiscal stimulus—given its role as the Czech Republic’s largest export destination—could offer some relief. The Central European government is getting ready to strike back against the new U.S. tariffs As Central Europe started calculating the probable costs of a trade war, leaders in the Czech Republic and Poland indicated that they were prepared to retaliate against new U.S. tariffs on April 3, while Hungary, a country in Europe, accused Brussels, the capital city of Belgium, of causing tensions with Washington. Furthermore, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the U.S. President Donald Trump’s universal tariffs a serious setback to the global economy and stated that the 27-member bloc was ready to retaliate with countermeasures if negotiations with Washington broke down. This came after Trump’s remarks caused Central Europe’s stock markets and currencies to drop sharply. The Czech crown was hardest hit as it dropped past the crucial 25 per euro mark in early trading before reducing its losses gradually by making adjustments to minimize the negative impact of the situation. In response, on the social media X platform, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala posted that having no tariffs was the best option. However, the two parties needed to be willing to agree. He highlighted that Europe was ready to engage in dialogue with the United States, but at the same time, it was prepared to respond clearly. Even though Poland was less vulnerable to risk because of its sizable domestic market and decreased reliance on auto exports, Donald Tusk, the prime minister of Poland, declared that the U.S. decision would slow economic growth and that appropriate decisions on reciprocal tariffs were required. Tusk elaborated on his X account that a preliminary assessment estimated that new U.S. tariffs might decrease Polish GDP by 0.4%. Even under conservative projections, losses are expected to surpass 10 billion zlotys (approximately $2.63 billion). Trump’s tariffs have disproportionately impacted the automotive sector, undermining growth in countries that support the industry Around 20% to 30% of Central Europe’s exports—largely automobiles—go to Germany, highlighting the region’s deep ties to car manufacturing. According to S&P Global, the new U.S. trade measures threaten to further dampen growth prospects across Central Europe. Last month, the Czech Automotive Industry Association said that its export-oriented auto industry might still suffer despite the Czech Republic having relatively little direct exposure to United States sales. The Czech Automotive Industry said in a statement that the tariff increase announced would “massively” affect many Czech parts and services suppliers, especially those that supply customers in Germany. This would result in a major loss of orders and fewer export opportunities. Erste Group economists warned that Slovakia could experience an even sharper impact, with the cumulative effect of the tariffs potentially shaving 1.5 percentage points off its GDP over the next three years.

Table of Contents Trump hits pause Wall street reclaims lost ground Inflation, liquidity, and a dollar dilemma A rally on thin ice? Trump hits pause On Apr. 9, President Donald Trump posted an unexpected update on Truth Social, temporarily walking back one of the most aggressive trade policies in recent memory. In a brief yet impactful message, he announced a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs affecting over 75 nations, replacing them with a streamlined 10% flat rate — China being the only exception. The announcement came after a turbulent week in the markets, marked by sharp volatility triggered by initial tariff hikes that ranged from 11% to as high as 50% across a wide range of U.S. trading partners. Mounting political pressure, financial market instability, and diplomatic unease appear to have influenced the White House’s decision. Several trade partners had warned that the abrupt escalation in tariffs risked tipping the U.S. toward a recession. According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent , the original tariffs were always designed as a strategic “leverage.” In that sense, he noted, they had served their purpose. More than 70 countries have now opened trade discussions with Washington, while key allies such as Japan and the EU have expressed a willingness to negotiate. Yet, while most nations were offered a temporary reprieve, China remains an outlier. Rather than easing its stance, the Trump administration raised tariffs on Chinese goods from an already punishing 104% to a staggering 125%. The escalation came in response to China’s own retaliatory measures, which included an 84% tariff on American imports. With neither side backing down, the U.S.-China trade confrontation now appears to be entering a more deeply entrenched phase. In response, Citi revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast for China, lowering it from 4.7% to 4.2%, citing rising trade uncertainty as a key factor. Let’s unpack how markets have reacted to this abrupt policy pivot, what it reveals about current economic sentiment, and where digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) might be headed in the near future. Wall street reclaims lost ground In an exclusive conversation with crypto.news, RabbitX CEO Ming Wu said the pause on tariffs marks a shift in trade policy and has already helped calm investor fears about a wider economic fallout. “The prolonged downtrend led many traders to take short positions. The unexpected tariff pause likely triggered a short squeeze, forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, thereby amplifying the upward momentum. Markets responded with broad optimism following Trump’s announcement, offering investors a welcome reprieve from the uncertainty that had gripped sentiment throughout the previous week.” In the U.S., equity indices surged across the board. The S&P 500 jumped 9.52%, logging its strongest single-day gain in over 16 years. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 12.16%, its most impressive rally since early 2001, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.87%, adding nearly 3,000 points. These gains helped claw back a sizable portion of the trillions in market value that had been wiped out over the prior four trading sessions, much of it due to fears surrounding the economic impact of the tariff escalation. Amid the rally, Goldman Sachs, which had previously warned of a rising recession risk, withdrew its forecast in light of the policy reversal. Positive momentum extended into Asian markets as they opened on Apr. 10. Japan’s Nikkei leapt over 9%, bouncing back sharply from a 4% decline the previous day. South Korea’s Kospi rose 6.6% after having briefly entered bear market territory earlier in the week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also staged a recovery, rising 2% after suffering its worst drop since 1997, a 13% plunge, but sentiment remained guarded due to the region’s heightened exposure to trade flows. In Europe, markets moved in sync with the global rebound. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed nearly 6% during the day’s session, bolstered by the European Union’s earlier move to approve retaliatory tariffs, followed almost immediately by Trump’s pullback. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the U.S. decision, calling it a “stabilizing step” and signaling a broader willingness to return to the negotiating table rather than deepen the trade dispute. Crypto markets reflected a similar uplift. BTC rose more than 6% in the 24 hours following the news, reaching around $81,650 as of writing on April 10. The rebound followed a steep drop during the initial tariff rollout, when Bitcoin had slipped 10% to around $74,500. While the recovery helped recapture some lost ground, BTC remains down 13% year-to-date and roughly 25% below its all-time high — suggesting that the move was more a short-term relief rally than a broader trend reversal. The global crypto market cap rose in tandem, increasing from $2.38 trillion earlier on Apr. 9 to approximately $2.6 trillion as of this writing — an addition of about $220 billion in the last 24-hours. Digital asset-linked stocks have also joined the rally. MicroStrategy (MSTR) soared nearly 25%, Coinbase (COIN) added around 17%, and Robinhood saw gains of about 24%. Grayscale’s Zach Pandl noted that persistent trade tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, could weigh on the U.S. dollar and stoke inflationary pressures. Inflation, liquidity, and a dollar dilemma The trade dispute between the U.S. and China continues to deepen, and that carries stark implications for the global economy, and for crypto markets that increasingly reflect macro sensitivities. According to the World Trade Organization, prolonged trade friction between the two largest economies could reduce bilateral trade in goods by up to 80%. While the U.S. and China together account for roughly 3% of global trade volume, their influence goes far beyond that, shaping supply chains, pricing power, and currency dynamics across both developed and emerging markets. If tensions were to evolve into a more permanent divide, what some analysts call a “two-bloc world”, the global economy could see a 7% decline in long-term real GDP as per WTO. In that sense, the Apr. 9 market rally reflects a sense of relief, not resolution. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s 7% climb paralleled gains in equities, pointing to a continued connection between crypto and broader risk sentiment. With its correlation to equities now hovering around 0.7, Bitcoin is no longer moving entirely on its own fundamentals. The inflation outlook adds another layer. U.S. inflation is projected to stay between 2.8% and 3% in the coming months, with G20 inflation edging closer to 4%. Amid this, a stronger dollar could put pressure on emerging market currencies, contributing to imported inflation in several regions. For crypto, this creates an unusual mix. On one hand, inflation risk often draws attention to Bitcoin as an alternative asset. On the other, a stronger dollar and tighter global liquidity tend to reduce speculative appetite, especially in emerging markets where crypto adoption often plays a more practical, value-preserving role. Policy responses are also in flux. The Federal Reserve has paused its rate-cut plans, citing inflation concerns, a move that limits the availability of cheap capital in the short term. Meanwhile, global money supply growth (M2) remains moderately supportive, but that cushion could fade by mid-year if inflation persists. If rate cuts are pushed into Q3 or beyond, and U.S. Treasury yields stay near current levels (around 4.3%), growth assets across the board, including crypto, could face renewed pressure. A rally on thin ice? Despite Bitcoin’s sharp rebound following the tariff pause, analysts remain divided on what comes next. From a technical perspective, traders are closely watching the $83,000 to $85,000 range as a near-term test for Bitcoin. According to market analyst Daan Crypto Trades, this zone aligns with the 4-hour 200 moving average, a level that has repeatedly pushed back price attempts over the past couple of weeks. $BTC Saw a strong move after the tariff pause was announced. Where BTC was more resilient on the downside, we saw equities pump more on the back of this pause (which makes sense as those are directly influenced by the tariffs).

Looking at the bigger picture, some market observers remain skeptical that the current rally marks the beginning of a sustained uptrend. Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, believes macroeconomic conditions are still too fragile to support a meaningful shift. will be an unpopular opinion that i don't think we are out the woods yet with what irreversibly happened with weakened yuan now exporting deflation + 10% tariff creating growth drag, the net outcome is still negative for risk assets especially if 10y stays above 4% (which is… — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) April 9, 2025 He points to lingering structural pressure from the 10% tariffs, a persistently elevated 10-year Treasury yield above 4%, and credit spreads that remain wide at over 400 basis points. These, he argues, reflect a market where liquidity is still thin. “It’s actually more concerning how little liquidity is in the market to experience casino swings like this,” he said. Through that lens, short-term rallies may not signal true strength. Instead, they could simply reflect volatility amplified by fleeting headlines and shallow order books rather than deeper structural support. Meanwhile, widely followed trader Edward Morra believes the market is still in bearish territory. “We are in a bear market. Unfortunate, but it’s undeniable,” he said. In his view, the recent bounce should not be trusted unless Bitcoin can decisively break above $94,000 and hold that level. My working assumption now is that we are in a bear market (unfortunate but its undeniable), so try to identify the top of this bounce as high as possible and derisk (hedge). A lot of stuff has to happen before we can say the bull market is truly back (e.g. BTC confidently… — Edward Morra (@edwardmorra_btc) April 10, 2025 He also notes a troubling lack of interest in altcoins. Many, he says, are failing to draw meaningful capital. “Most strong ones are about to print a complacency shoulder,” he warned, suggesting that some tokens may still be stuck in accumulation zones, or worse, on a slow path toward delisting or neglect. In the near term, the key levels to watch are both technical and policy-related. Bitcoin holding above $81,000 offers a base to build on. Sustained movement beyond $85,000 could bring in momentum buyers, while any pullback might test recent support. On the macro front, any progress in trade negotiations, signs of easing inflation, or clearer guidance from the Federal Reserve could help crypto find more stable footing. For now, this remains a market that demands both curiosity and caution. Trade wisely, and never invest more than you are prepared to lose.

However, the operative word there is supposed to; to be more precise, the entire thing is, unfortunately, nothing more than an unsubstantiated, viral rumor. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has not confirmed anything about a $3,200 one-time payment. A windfall like that would surely have been useful — but taking the time to consider what you would have done with such a one-time cash injection also has utility. Finbold has decided to consult OpenAI ’s flagship large language model (LLM), ChatGPT 4.0, to determine the 3 best cryptocurrencies that one could invest in with a $3,200 Social Security check. ChatGPT would use its $3,200 Social Security check to buy BTC, SOL, and XRP OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) model would leverage a $3,200 Social Security check by investing in three cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin ( BTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and XRP . ChatGPT’s first pick was Bitcoin — and it would account for half of the entire investment. The LLM outlined three key bullish factors that drove its decision: the tailwind of Trump’s recent tariff pause, steady exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) inflows, and resilient institutional demand for the leading digital asset, in spite of recent market-wide challenges. Bullish factors impacting BTC prices. Source: OpenAI The second cryptocurrency that ChatGPT chose, Solana, would account for $1,000 of the $3,200 Social Security check being invested. Despite Solana’s recent crash below $100 , bullish catalysts such as an endorsement from BlackRock, growing ETF exposure, and increasing real-world utility and adoption were enough to sway OpenAI’s model to the bullish side of the aisle. Bullish factors impacting SOL prices. Source: OpenAI Last but not least, the AI model would set aside $600 to invest in XRP . Despite a 1 billion token unlock set for May 1, several positive developments, such as Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road , the recent launch of the first XRP ETF, and the resolution of the longstanding Ripple v SEC case were highlighted as positive factors that could send prices on an upward trajectory. Bullish factors impacting XRP prices. Source: OpenAI As enlightening as ChatGPT’s cryptocurrency picks are, readers should remember that we’re talking about a hypothetical $3,200 Social Security Check here. Although the rumor might have started in a benign way due to misinformation, topics like these are fertile ground for scammers seeking to take advantage of the underinformed.

STRF is safer with a 10% yield on $100 liquidation preference, while STRK offers potential BTC upside with 8% yield plus an embedded everlasting call option on 1/10 MSTR share. Both preferred shares are well-covered unless BTC falls over 75%, making them suitable for investors who believe BTC will not face catastrophic failure. I rate STRK and STRF a Hold, with potential Buy due to their strong yields possibly outperforming other assets in a downturn. They may very well outperform if the macro picture gets worse. I’m a Bitcoin bull, and I recognize that many readers on Seeking Alpha are not. If you think Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is tulips, you can still gain some controlled exposure to the speculation on BTC for the benefit of your retirement. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy (MSTR), preferred shares come in two batches: Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF). Both offer around 10% effective yields, paid quarterly. As you’ll see in this article, the yields appear quite safe. Here’s the breakdown. Strategy Perpetual Strife 10% Preferred Stock (STRF) Risk averse investors can purchase Strife (STRF), the more senior preferred series of the two. Strategy has committed to ensuring that STRF will be the most senior preferred shares the company will ever issue. STRF offers 10% yield on the $100 liquidation preference value. This means $10 per share per year dividend should be paid to STRF investors. At a market price of $86.25 as of April 8 close, this is a yield of 11.6%. Strategy Perpetual Strike 8% Preferred Stock (STRK) Income seekers who want some possible upside from BTC can purchase Strike (STRK). This pays 8% on the $100 liquidation preference, which comes to a $8 per share per year dividend paid to STRK investors. At a market price of $81.13 as of April 8 close, this is a 9.9% yield. STRK is special in that each share is convertible into 1/10 a share of MSTR common stock. This means that STRK is an everlasting call option combined with a perpetuity. There are therefore two ways for STRK investors to win: BTC can go up, which sends MSTR higher, which raises the value of STRK’s option value. The floor price of STRK can be thought of as 1/10 MSTR, which is about $23 at a share price of $230. But if, for example, MSTR goes to $1000, then the floor price of STRK becomes $100. Interest rates can go down, which raises STRK’s perpetuity value. Given a fixed income stream, lower rates mean lower discounting which means a larger net present value. Generally, you can think of the everlasting call option as an option with delta close to 1 as long as implied volatility of the underlying asset is about 80 or higher. An everlasting call option also almost 0 gamma. The high IV requirement isn’t a hurdle for MSTR, which is easily the most volatile large cap stock in the US markets. Where Does The Yield Come From? Is It Safe? The yield comes from BTC and is backed by a massive overcollateralization thanks to Strategy’s treasury of $40 billion worth of BTC. Strategy takes the proceeds of the preferred stock issuance to purchase BTC. If BTC rises more than 9.9% or 11.6% each year, then the BTC purchased with those proceeds are enough to fund the dividends sustainably. What if BTC does not rise more than this hurdle rate? Well, there are only $850 million notional value in STRF issued and $765 million notional value in STRK issued . Senior to both series of preferred stock is $8.2 billion in convertible debt , though about half is ITM and should convert assuming MSTR stays at current levels or goes up. Thus, the $1.615 billion of preferred stock is covered by a net $32 billion in unencumbered capital in the form of Strategy’s enormous BTC treasury ($40 billion BTC minus $8 billion debt). This is an enormous coverage ratio. BTC must fall quite a bit (over 75%) before the preferred investors are unable to get their money back. And remember that right now, both STRK and STRF are trading at a sizable discount to their $100 liquidation preference. So the risk of both preferred shares is that BTC does fall over 75%. If you are sure BTC is tulips that are destined to go to 0, then this might not meet your risk profile for long term investment. However, if you are willing to take the view that BTC is tulips which will ebb and flow over time but probably not have a catastrophic, terminal failure event, then either preferred share is likely appropriate for your investment consideration. There is technically a risk that the company delays dividend payments on STRK. If cash flow is essential to your strategy, then this is a point worth noticing. While it is possible for payments to be delayed on STRF too, the dividend rate obligation compounds with each skipped quarter , up to a max rate of 18% per annum, so it is unlikely that these dividends are skipped. Just for completeness, I will mention that in practice, the dividends will almost certainly not be paid by cash proceeds of selling BTC. Strategy will likely use the sale of MSTR common to fund dividends or proceeds from future convertible bond issuances. Because the common stock is so exposed to BTC, using an ATM offering is effectively like selling BTC (and technically the BTC would be sold at a premium if the stock trades at a premium to its BTC NAV). For what it is worth, Strategy insiders are buying the preferred shares . The Bottom Line I would rate both STRK and STRF a Hold for the average investor. Given the extreme risk off behavior we are seeing at the macro level, I am somewhat compelled to raise it to a Buy rating since I do believe we could see 10% perpetual yields outperforming most other assets. While I remain bullish on BTC, it is also undeniable that the macro picture looks uglier and stable fixed income may be better for weathering the storm. So, I don’t think these preferred returns will be particularly strong, but they may very well be stronger than most other investments, especially if the current drawdown in the broader markets continue.",BTC-USD|MSTR|STRK|STRF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-10 15:43:37

Still, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP prices have a hidden $4.5 trillion catalyst that may propel them higher this quarter. Crypto Prices Awaits for a $4.5 Trillion Catalyst Most crypto investors are ignoring a $4.5 trillion catalyst hidden in plain sight. This catalyst is Donald Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill that will may be passed into law soon. In an X post, Trump called it the biggest tax cuts in USA history, saying : “ Great News! “ The Big, Beautiful Bill ” is coming along really well. Republicans are working together nicely. Biggest Tax Cuts in USA History!!! Getting close.” The bill will be bullish for crypto coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP because of the amount it seeks to cut. The estimate is that it will extend the 2017 cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On top of this, it will have more incentives like eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay. This means that taxpayers will have more money in their bank accounts, which some may divert to investing in the crypto market. Historically, many young people use their savings to speculate in assets like Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, and XRP. Interest Rate Cuts to Boost Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, and XRP Price Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, xrp price On top of this, the Federal Reserve may deliver another bazooka by cutting interest rates now that US inflation is falling . Data released on Thursday showed that US inflation dropped to 2.4%, and is slowly nearing the Fed target of 2.0%. The odds of a rate cut have risen after Donald Trump declared tariffs on most countries. While he has paused tariffs on over 70 countries , he maintained the base 10%. He also maintained hefty taxes on cars, steel, and aluminum. Additionally, he boosted China tariffs to 125% . Therefore, in a note, Mark Zandi, the respected economist at Moody’s, boosted his recession odds to 60%. He also warned that global investors may start losing faith in the US, making its bonds less of a safe haven. Zandi Warning on Safe Haven Therefore, a combination of falling inflation and slow economic growth means that the Fed may deliver more cuts than expected. Polymarket traders have placed a 52% chance of the Fed cutting by June this year. Another poll shows that more participants see the Fed cutting rates three times this year. On top of this, the Senate voted for Paul Atkins as the SEC Chair , which will lead to more deregulation and ETF approvals. The Bottomline Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, and XRP price remain in a deep bear market this year and are in search of a catalyst. The top catalysts to watch will be the potential interest rate cuts, US tax cuts, and the recent confirmation of Atkins as the SEC chair.

Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Eclipse XRP and Ethereum XRP’s $12 target would require a 586 percent gain, while Ethereum’s $10,000 target would need a 292 percent jump — both capped by market caps ($118 billion for XRP, $305 billion for Ethereum). MAGACOIN FINANCE Goal: $5 Using less than a 1mil market cap with a 1570.6% presale price increase: Stage 1: $0.0001772 —>Stage 3: $0.0002772 Its DeFi lending promises 20%+ annual yields against XRP’s 1,500 tps at 0.00001 XRP, and Ethereum’s gas at $2.50 per transaction on average. With a 71,329% potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is well ahead of XRP’s 586% and Eth’s 292% for the potential for $100 to $10K.

For XRP, it is ETF approvals, while Ethereum thrives through layer-2 scaling sidechains like Arbitrum, with about $1.5 billion in TVL. MAGACOIN FINANCE still has two presale stages to go, according to its roadmap. It has earned $5.7 million through organic expansion and retail investor confidence, which has drawn comparison to XRP’s $1.5 million weekly influx. A $100 investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE touches $10,000 at $0.027. This is a 100x increase from presale, possibly before it reaches $5. With Phase 7 at 80 % sold, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale at $0.0002772 nears its end. XRP besides Ethereum may reach $10K by 2030 but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 71,329 % potential might do it by 2025.

BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price volatility ticking higher around the release of the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers. These numbers came in broadly below expectations, revealing slowing inflationary forces despite mass-market disruption due to US trade tariffs. An official press release from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) stated: “The all items index rose 2.4 percent for the 12 months ending March, after rising 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending February. The all items less food and energy index rose 2.8 percent over the last 12 months, the smallest 12-month increase since March 2021.” US CPI 12-month % change. Source: BLS While notionally a tailwind for risk assets, US stocks were in no mood for relief at the open. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index were down 3% and 3.7%, respectively, at the time of writing. “Markets think the recently strong jobs report and cool inflation data gives Trump the ‘green light’ to continue the trade war,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter suggested in part of a response on X. Kobeissi nonetheless acknowledged the implications of rapidly declining inflation — something which tariffs had yet to influence. “This marks the lowest Core CPI inflation rate in 4 years,” it continued in a separate X thread. “It also puts Headline CPI inflation just 40 basis points above the Fed's 2% target. Inflation is down 60 basis points over the last 3 months alone.” BTC price rebound may rest with ”Spoofy the Whale” Turning to BTC price action, market participants were in a wait-and-see mode after the US paused the majority of its tariff implementations for 90 days . Related: Crypto trading firm warns of 'classic bull trap' as Bitcoin tags $82.7K For popular trader Daan Crypto Trades, a reclaim of at least $83,000 was necessary as an initial step for bulls. “$BTC Saw a strong move after the tariff pause was announced,” he told X followers. “Where BTC was more resilient on the downside, we saw equities pump more on the back of this pause (which makes sense as those are directly influenced by the tariffs).” An accompanying chart showed nearby key trend lines around the spot price. “BTC traded right back into the 4H 200MA (Purple) which has capped price over the past couple of weeks. That $83-85K is a key level to overtake for the bulls,” he continued. “Right below we can see the ~$81.1K horizontal being a key level that sees quite a lot of action. I think it's a good one to watch in the short term. Trading below that area could turn this into a nasty deviation/stop hunt.” BTC/USDT perpetual swaps 4-hour chart. Source: Daan Crypto Trades/X Analyzing order book liquidity, Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, drew attention to both the 21-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) on the daily chart. “First attempt at breaking resistance at the 21-Day MA was rejected, however BTC bid liquidity is moving higher so I think we’ll see another attempt,” he summarized earlier on the day. “If bulls can R/S Flip the 21-Day, there is even stronger resistance where liquidity is stacked around the trend line and the 50-Day MA.” BTC/USD 1-day chart with 21, 50 SMA.

The actions of one entity in particular, which he previously dubbed “Spoofy the Whale,” remained a point of consideration. “If ‘Spoofy’ will give us a roof pull, we’ll get a shot at the 100-Day and the 2025 open at $93.3k, which is the gateway back to 6-figure Bitcoin,” he concluded.

43176160,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=708144,1744300800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43176160.jpeg,Investor Says 450% Gains Are on the Table as Cardano (ADA) and Another Token Under $0.05 Heat Up,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/investor-says-450-gains-are-on-the-table-as-cardano-ada-and-another-token-under-0-05-heat-up/,"Crypto analysts have made a bold prediction, claiming that early investors in Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could achieve returns upward of 450% as both tokens continue into rapid growth. As Cardano slowly churns ahead on the back of up-and-coming upgrades, Mutuum Finance’s presale has gone berserk, racking up $6.5 million in sales and 396 million tokens moved across 8,100 holders. Now trading at $0.025 in Phase 4, once Phase 5 is released, MUTM’s price will jump 20% to $0.03 — meaning those buying now can expect immediate upside. Given a disciplined lending mechanism, and a listing target of $0.06, the path of the token suggests even more aggressive action post-launch – potentially hitting $3.50, observers claim. Cardano’s Measured Ascent Cardano (ADA), meanwhile, a stalwart of blockchain innovation, sits at $0.63 with predictions of slow burn toward $10 in 2030. Technical upgrades such as Leios protocol are expected to address barriers to scalability with experts estimating 2025 ranges of $1.81 and $2.62. While its deliberate growth attracts long-term investors, ADA’s multi-year horizon seems modest compared to red-hot emerging tokens offering explosive short-term gains. Market sentiment suggests that though Cardano is doing great work to build its ecosystem, faster-moving projects are stealing both the attention—and capital—of those looking for a swift increase in their portfolios. Mutuum Finance Soars as Presale Kicks Off Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the talk of the town as its presale zips through phase 4 – tokens currently $0.025. Early investors have rendered a paper return of 140% in anticipation of its $0.06 listing on the exchange, yet the real interest transcends listing. With MUTM’s post-launch price being estimated at $3.50, analysts predict a 13,900% surge from the current stage of MUTM. This prediction is based on its paired lending architecture, which creates constant buy pressure via revenue-redistribution mechanics. Each platform fee initiates automatic MUTM purchases that direct tokens back to stakers and throttle sell-side volatility. Coupled with overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer borrowing options, the system maintains sustainable demand—something in short supply in speculative markets. Momentum Ahead of Audit As Mutuum Finance builds towards its next stage, developers are also finalizing a smart contract audit with industry-respected CertiK, a major step that is likely to help establish investor confidence. Once completed, results will be disclosed through formal channels, which will lend rigor to the project’s security assertions. The velocity of the presale, meanwhile, speaks to its attractiveness; the $0.025 price point of Phase 4 comes ahead of a 20% rise to $0.03 in Phase 5, generating urgency among buyers who want to make the most of their investment. There are 11 phases in total, and each successive stage closes the window for amassing tokens at lower valuations. Utility Vs. Opportunity Balance Mutuum Finance has no time to waste as Cardano’s decade-long roadmap prioritizes gradual perfection. Its presale model ensures early backers a 140% profit on launch, but what braids it into a project with some legs, is the platform’s utility — providing lending, borrowing, and yield generation. mtTokens are interest-bearing assets, such that the more one holds the more value they represent, thus integrating another layer of incentives to keep these tokens and in a sense rewards users for maintaining the health of the ecosystem. As the market is flooded with hype-driven projects, MUTM’s real use cases and deflationary tokenomics set it apart. For those interested in Mutuum Finance’s presale, time is becoming a deciding factor. The $0.025 price point of Phase 4 vanishes the moment Phase 5 starts, securing a 20% gain for early movers. As the audit progresses and exchange listings approach, the journey of MUTM resembles those of early stage opportunities that changed portfolios in previous cycles. For investors craving exposure to high-yield DeFi innovations, options become limited: dwell on the sidelines or acquire tokens before the next jump.

As the two countries announce their moves one after another, Bitcoin and altcoins have been the assets that have been hit the hardest by this war. BTC and the market surged yesterday after Donald Trump announced the suspension of tariffs for most countries. However, Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital has warned about the recent recovery in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices. QCP analysts argued that the retaliatory race between China and the US could turn into a classic bull trap. QCP stated that this is not the time to relax, it is time to prepare for China's next move, and that the rise in BTC and altcoins could be a bull trap. “With China being targeted so openly, market participants are preparing for Beijing's countermove. If retaliation comes strongly, the euphoric rally could quickly turn into a classic bull trap.” “The start of the devaluation of China's currency, the Yuan, is not just an economic signal, it is a trigger,” said Sina, co-founder of asset management firm 21st Capital, while warning of a QCP bull trap. “Historically, when the yuan weakens, capital doesn't stay put. It flees. Some of it flows into gold, some into foreign assets, and a meaningful portion goes into Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

OKX (OKB) is boosting its offering for institutional clients. On Thursday, April 10, a crypto exchange partnered with Standard Chartered , with backing from Brevan Howard and Franklin Templeton, to launch a collateral mirroring program. This program will enable institutional clients to keep their collateral with Standard Chartered, instead of with OKX. The exchange will then “mirror” this collateral into their accounts, without ever taking custody of the funds. You might also like: OKX: A Crypto-to-Crypto and Fiat Exchange The program launched as a pilot, complying with Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (known as VARA) regulations. Standard Chartered will serve as a custodian under that framework, supervised by Dubai’s financial regulators. “Standard Chartered acts as the independent, regulated custodian in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, ensuring the safe storage of the assets used as collateral,” OKX Why OKX offers Standard Chartered custody There is growing demand among institutions for crypto trading. For instance, CME Group reported a 73% increase in the daily average volume of its crypto futures market. However, these institutional clients don’t trust crypto exchanges with custody of their funds. For instance, exchanges run a risk of hacking and bankruptcy, like in the case of FTX . This, in turn, exposes institutional clients to counterparty risk, potentially leading to billions in losses. You might also like: OKX developer spills details about OKX Wallet app ‘too early’ At the same time, regulations for crypto exchanges are typically less stringent than those for banks or other financial institutions. For this reason, collateral mirroring enables institutions to safeguard their funds with a trusted party. What’s more, Standard Chartered is a Globally Systemically Important Bank, meaning it falls under some of the strictest regulations in financial markets. User funds are segregated from the bank’s balance sheet, ensuring they are protected even if Standard Chartered encounters financial difficulty.

Established players like Solana , TON , Chainlink (LINK) , and Hedera (HBAR) continue to build reliable infrastructure for the next wave of adoption. But few match the current retail momentum that’s forming around MAGACOINFINANCE —a token that’s already proving its ability to attract serious investor attention.

The token is currently priced at $0.0002804 , with a confirmed listing set at $0.007 —creating a built-in 2,396% upside for those who move before it lists. What separates MAGACOINFINANCE is its structure: no venture backing, no private allocations, and no early unlocks. Every buyer enters at the same price, and the supply is capped at 100 billion tokens , helping enforce long-term scarcity. With wallet adoption rising and online conversations growing by the day, this token is quickly moving from hidden gem to high-priority watchlist across investor circles. 50% BONUS – MAGA50X Still Available The MAGA50X bonus remains active, giving all contributors a 50% bonus on token purchases.

The license allows Binance to expand its fiat services through BPay Global, operating as a regulated entity in Bahrain. BPay Global is authorized to provide fiat top-ups, withdrawals, custodial services, and e-wallet functions. Binance users can now conduct fiat transactions through bank transfers and debit or credit cards directly on the platform. The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has granted a payment service provider license to BPay Global, a subsidiary of Binance, to operate in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The PSP license will allow the company to provide fiat services to Binance customers worldwide, including fiat deposits… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 10, 2025 “This license represents a positive step in enhancing Bahrain’s digital payments ecosystem, particularly in its support for the crypto-related sector as well as fiat payment solutions,” said Abdulla Haji, Director of the CBB’s Licensing Directorate. Tameem Almoosawi, General Manager of Binance Bahrain and BPay Global, said this marks the first time a Binance entity has been licensed to act as a full-fledged payment service provider. “With this license, BPay Global will provide Binance users with further choice of low-cost fiat on-and off-ramps,” Almoosawi said. Bahrain’s Crypto Strategy: From Bitcoin Products to BPay Licensing BPay’s entry into the Bahraini market strengthens Binance’s regulated service offerings in the Gulf region. The approval of BPay Global’s PSP license adds to Bahrain’s broader push for regulatory clarity in digital finance. The Kingdom has moved quickly to establish itself as a digital finance hub in the MENA region. According to a report from October 2024, the National Bank of Bahrain (NBB) launched the region’s first Bitcoin-linked structured investment product . @NBBOnline has introduced Bitcoin investment product, which will be available “exclusively for accredited investors.” #Bitcoin #NBB #InvestmentFund https://t.co/NlKyXMPaBj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 8, 2024 This product, developed in collaboration with ARP Digital—co-founded by a former Goldman Sachs partner—offers accredited investors exposure to Bitcoin’s potential gains, with a capped upside and full capital protection on the downside. In April 2024, ARP Digital also received an operational license from the NBB, allowing it to expand its crypto custody, trading, and portfolio management services. Just prior to this, Crypto.com was also granted a PSP license in Bahrain, adding to the country’s expanding ecosystem of regulated crypto entities. Between July 2023 and June 2024, Chainalysis data showed that the MENA region accounted for 7.5% of global crypto transaction volume. Bahrain’s proactive regulatory approach has made it a base of operations for several cryptocurrency firms. Crypto Licensing Trends Across Global Markets Bahrain’s stance on crypto licensing mirrors a broader international trend, as regulators in Europe and beyond begin to formalize oversight of digital asset platforms. On February 18, OKX announced that it had secured passporting rights under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework . @okx secures MiCA licensing, unlocking passporting rights across 28 EEA nations.

This includes spot and bot trading, OTC infrastructure, and over 300 trading pairs. Users in countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and Sweden now have access to localized platforms, Euro-denominated trading pairs, free bank transfers, and local-language customer support.

Bitcoin (BTC), which rose more than 8% the day prior, dipped about 4% below $80,000 again on Thursday. The decline in bitcoin came alongside a renewed plunge in the Nasdaq, which was lower by 5.5% following yesterday's 12% rally as traders are assessing U.S. President Donald Trump’s next steps in his tariff policy. Crypto stocks also took a hit. MicroStrategy (MSTR) was down 11.2%, and Coinbase (COIN) and Marathon Digital (MARA) fell 8.1% and 9.3%, respectively. Already sharply lower on the session, the stock sell-off escalated after a tweet circulated saying that a White House official confirmed that the total tariff rate on China now stands at 145%, not 125% as President Trump stated yesterday. The Executive Order details that the “reciprocal” tariff rate surged from 84% to 125% overnight. When combined with the existing 20% tariff on fentanyl-related goods, the total rate reaches 145%. China, in a bid to strike at Trump’s initial tariffs, said it would reduce imports of American movies, intensifying the trade war between the two countries. Meanwhile, gold is soaring up 3% and hitting a new all-time high of $3,168. The DXY index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, has dropped below 101, effectively reversing its entire November rally, and now down 9% from the January highs. Politically charged environment ""The macro outlook is anything but secure,"" said Kirill Kretov, senior expert at crypto trading automation platform CoinPanel. ""This is a politically charged environment, where headlines have the power to reshape sentiment almost instantly."" ""A key swing factor now is trade policy,"" Kretov added, with the Trump administration's ever-changing tariff policies adding to concerns about inflation.

Amid this, an Ethereum (ETH) price prediction seems like a key topic to discuss in order to determine where the price might head next. Tariff Pause Rally Wiped Out by CPI Report Following the 90-day pause on tariffs, the overall cryptocurrency market witnessed a notable upside rally, with ETH recording a price surge of over 20%. However, on April 10, 2025, all these gains have faded and the trend appears to be turning negative following the release of the United States CPI report. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action and Technical Analysis According to expert technical analysis, ETH appears bearish and is currently near the make-or-break level of $1,450. This key support level will determine where the ETH price is heading in the future. ETH has been consolidating near this level for the past four trading days. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if the downward selling pressure continues and ETH closes a daily candle below the $1,450 mark, there is a strong possibility it could drop another 30% to reach the $1,000 level in the coming days. However, if the ETH price manages to hold this key support level, there is a strong possibility it could once again soar and reclaim the $1,850 level in the near future. Whale Dumps $11.80 Million Worth of ETH Looking at the bearish market sentiment and recent price action, an OG Ethereum whale recently dumped 7,974 ETH worth $11.8 million at an average price of $1,479 after being dormant for 3 years. Despite this notable sell-off, the whale still holds 30,606 ETH worth $45.7 million. Another #Ethereum OG starts dumping $ETH after 3 years of dormancy!

The market is buzzing, with new projects popping up that seem to solve problems old coins couldn’t quite address. Bittensor (TAO), for example, has been on an absolute tear. It’s been making waves by tapping into machine learning and decentralized AI, which is pretty wild. But what has everyone talking these days is Qubetics , a rising star that could be the next big thing in crypto, especially for anyone looking at the future of cross-border transactions. With everything happening in crypto right now, it’s impossible to ignore how these projects are changing the game. Qubetics is aiming to solve real-life problems that many of the older coins just couldn’t. For years, cross-border transactions have been a nightmare, with high fees, long processing times, and plenty of hidden costs. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping up to offer a real solution that could bring fast, affordable, and secure international payments. Whether you’re running a business, making a freelance payment, or even paying for a vacation, $TICS could be the answer. And with the presale already in full swing, many experts are calling this the next best-performing crypto to explode in value. Let’s dive deeper into the latest trends with Bittensor and Qubetics, and explore why $TICS could be a must-watch in 2025. Bittensor (TAO): Riding the Wave of Machine Learning and Decentralized AI Bittensor has been shaking things up in 2025. This project is all about pushing the limits of what blockchain technology can do, specifically by blending machine learning and decentralized AI. The idea is simple: create a decentralized network where people can contribute their computational power and AI knowledge to train models and get rewarded in TAO tokens. What makes Bittensor one of the best performing cryptos is how it taps into two of the hottest trends in tech today: AI and blockchain. This combination is drawing in more and more attention, with predictions pointing to steady growth in the coming years. What makes this even more exciting is that Bittensor is solving a major issue in the AI space. AI models require a ton of data and computing power to improve. Instead of relying on a few big companies to monopolize the process, Bittensor allows a distributed network of users to collaborate in a trustless, decentralized way. This, in turn, leads to a more innovative and dynamic AI landscape. Imagine being able to contribute to AI development from your own computer while earning crypto rewards—sounds pretty cool, right? Analysts are predicting continued growth for Bittensor, with some even forecasting its price to hit $50 per TAO within the next few years. For now, though, it remains one of the best-performing cryptos for those looking for cutting-edge tech mixed with the power of blockchain. The decentralized AI revolution is just beginning, and Bittensor is definitely one to watch. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is quietly turning heads as one of the best-performing cryptos of 2025. What sets $TICS apart is its focus on solving a problem that affects millions of people daily: cross-border transactions. Whether you’re a freelancer sending payments to clients overseas, a small business owner paying international suppliers, or someone just trying to send money to family across the globe, Qubetics aims to make these transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. It’s this real-world application that makes $TICS such a hot topic right now. But let’s be clear—this isn’t just another “pay-to-play” crypto. Qubetics is addressing major pain points with cross-border payments. Traditional systems often come with hefty fees, delayed transfers, and a lack of transparency. Qubetics aims to change all of that. With the use of blockchain, cross-border payments can be processed quickly and securely, without the typical delays that come with banks and traditional money transfer services. You could make a payment in seconds, and it would cost far less than using a bank or a service like PayPal. For people in developing countries or those without access to traditional banking, Qubetics can be a game-changer. Right now, the Qubetics presale is in full swing, and things are looking promising. The presale is in its 29th stage, and $TICS has already raised more than $15.9 million, with over 24,500 holders snapping up more than 507 million tokens. Currently, each $TICS token is priced at $0.1573, and analysts are already predicting massive potential for this project. Some predict $TICS could hit $1 after the presale, offering a 535% return on investment (ROI). Even more exciting, $TICS could soar to $5 post-launch, leading to a 3,078% ROI. Analysts are even saying $TICS could reach $15 after the mainnet launch—an eye-popping 9,434% ROI. Here’s why the Qubetics presale is such a big deal: The presale is moving fast, and there are still opportunities to buy in at $0.1573 per token. With over 507 million tokens already sold, the momentum is undeniable. Predictions show a possible 535% ROI after the presale ends, and a 9,434% ROI after the mainnet launch. More than 24,500 holders are already backing $TICS, showing strong community support. Qubetics could be the future of payments.

But this isn’t just any funding story; Ominimo, barely a year old and already profitable, has clinched a €10 million (approximately $11 million) equity investment from Zurich Insurance Group for a 5% stake. This deal values the company at a remarkable €200 million ($220 million)! At a time when even established insurtech unicorns are facing headwinds, Ominimo’s success story is a powerful testament to the potential of AI insurtech and a beacon of hope for the industry. Let’s dive into what makes Ominimo tick and why this investment is turning heads. What’s the Secret Sauce Behind Ominimo’s Skyrocketing Valuation? Ominimo’s founders – Dusan Komar, Dennis Weinbender, and Laslo Horvath – understood a fundamental truth: attracting top tech talent to the often-perceived ‘mundane’ insurance sector requires more than just deep pockets. It demands an environment where brilliant minds can apply their skills to truly transform an industry. Their answer? Build a company that empowers engineers and data scientists to reinvent insurance from the ground up using cutting-edge technology, especially AI in insurance . Here’s a breakdown of Ominimo’s winning formula: Talent Magnet: Competitive pay is a given, but Ominimo goes further by offering engineers the chance to work on genuinely challenging and impactful projects, utilizing advanced AI to solve real-world problems in insurance. Profitability from the Start: Bootstrapped and launched just a year ago, Ominimo is already profitable. This is a stark contrast to many startups that prioritize growth at all costs, often burning through capital. Ominimo’s focus on sustainable growth is a key differentiator. Rapid Growth in First Market: In its initial market, Hungary, Ominimo has signed up 300,000 policies. This rapid adoption rate demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach and the market demand for innovative insurance solutions. Strategic Investment: Securing investment from Zurich Insurance Group, a major industry player, is a significant validation of Ominimo’s model. This strategic backing not only provides capital but also opens doors for expansion and collaboration. Why is This Investment in AI Insurtech Significant Now? The timing of this insurance startup funding is particularly noteworthy. The article points out the struggles of WeFox, a once-unicorn insurtech company now facing challenges. This situation highlights a crucial lesson: rapid growth without a solid foundation can be perilous. Ominimo’s measured, profitable growth approach, coupled with its focus on AI in insurance innovation, stands in stark contrast and presents a more sustainable model for the future of insurtech. Consider these points in the current market context: Factor Ominimo’s Approach Traditional/Struggling Insurtechs Growth Strategy Sustainable, profitable growth Aggressive, often loss-leading growth Technology Focus Deep AI integration for risk assessment and pricing Often focuses on UX/UI improvements without deep tech innovation Financial Health Profitable, attracting strategic investment Burning cash, seeking lifeline financing Market Validation Rapid customer adoption, strategic partnership Customer acquisition challenges, investor skepticism Ominimo’s AI Advantage: Beyond the Hype Many insurtech companies claim to use AI, but Ominimo emphasizes tangible results. CEO Dusan Komar highlights that their “loss ratio” is below the market average, and they’ve captured a 7% market share in Hungary. This isn’t just about a fancy user interface; it’s about fundamentally better risk assessment and pricing powered by AI in insurance . Ominimo’s AI goes deeper than surface-level applications. They leverage a vast array of data points to understand risk far more comprehensively. While traditional insurers might use 5-15 parameters for pricing, Ominimo taps into hundreds, including seemingly minor details like a car’s length, which surprisingly correlates with parking accident frequency. This granular data analysis, combined with sophisticated algorithms, is the core of their insurtech valuation proposition. Key aspects of Ominimo’s AI-driven approach include: Extensive Data Utilization: Leveraging hundreds of variables for risk assessment, going beyond traditional parameters. AI-Powered Pricing: Using machine learning to identify complex patterns and correlations for more accurate and competitive pricing. Performance-Driven Results: Demonstrable market performance with lower loss ratios and significant market share gain. Focus on Deep Tech: Prioritizing genuine AI innovation under the hood, rather than just user interface enhancements. Expansion Plans and the Future of Ominimo With this fresh injection of capital, Ominimo is poised for rapid expansion. They plan to enter over 10 new markets, starting with Poland, Sweden, and the Netherlands, leveraging Zurich as their risk carrier. Initially focused on car insurance, Ominimo aims to expand into property insurance as well. This strategic partnership with Zurich provides not only financial backing but also crucial infrastructure and market access for scaling their operations across Europe. Alison Martin, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa at Zurich Insurance Group, aptly summarizes the strategic rationale behind their investment and partnership: “Growing our retail business profitably is a key ambition… That is why I am delighted with DA Direkt’s distribution partnership with Ominimo, which will allow us to offer innovative motor insurance solutions and expand our retail customer base in Europe…” A Powerful Example of AI Transforming Traditional Industries Ominimo’s story is more than just a funding announcement; it’s a powerful example of how AI insurtech is poised to reshape traditional industries. By focusing on deep technological innovation, sustainable growth, and attracting top talent, Ominimo has quickly become a standout player in the competitive insurtech landscape. Their impressive insurtech valuation and strategic investment from Zurich signal a bright future and serve as inspiration for other startups aiming to disrupt established sectors with AI-driven solutions.

Semler Scientific (SMLR) is not your typical Bitcoin treasury company. With a strong cash position but years of underwhelming stock performance, the company turned to Bitcoin—not as a gamble, but as a strategic catalyst. What followed was a radical shift in valuation, shareholder engagement, and long-term positioning. “We were the second U.S. public company to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve strategy. Michael Saylor obviously is the quintessential pioneer, but we’re in that group.” ACTIVISM MEETS BITCOIN CONVICTION Semler joined Semler Scientific’s board just two years ago. “I became an activist on the Semler board. I wasn’t actually involved in the company until two years ago,” he said. What he found was a business generating cash but not being rewarded for it—“a zombie company,” as he put it. “We had all this cash. It looked eerily similar to MicroStrategy in August of 2020. We had a very similar profile. A lot of cash. A lot of our market cap was in cash. We weren’t really growing.” Rather than pursue an acquisition, Semler helped steer the company toward Bitcoin. “We needed to figure out a way to jump start our growth and we settled on Bitcoin, which was a great decision.” A TRANSFORMATIONAL MOVE Since announcing its Bitcoin treasury strategy, Semler Scientific has experienced a significant shift—not just in valuation, but in momentum and perception. “Our stock at one point had quadrupled. Now it’s basically doubled… it was doing nothing for years, and it was actually going down for years,” said Semler. For a company long seen as stagnant despite consistent profitability, the Bitcoin move catalyzed a market reappraisal and brought renewed visibility to a previously overlooked business. The internal response has been equally powerful. “Everybody’s fully on board,” Semler said. “It’s just been great to get this kind of electricity into our stock, into our company.” What began as an activist-led effort to escape a “zombie” stock profile has become a strategic unlock. For companies with strong fundamentals but no growth narrative, Bitcoin offers more than asset appreciation—it offers signaling power, capital preservation, and a way to re-engage the market on new terms. FROM UNDER THE RADAR TO THE SPOTLIGHT For a company that had spent years overlooked by the market, Semler Scientific’s pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy didn’t just shift financial fundamentals—it dramatically raised the company’s profile. “I had strong conviction in Bitcoin, but I had no idea what I was getting into… The entire social media aspect of it was really jolting for me,” said Semler. A former journalist and seasoned investor, Semler is used to working behind the scenes—asking the questions, not answering them. “I’m more of an introvert. I’m not into kind of exposing myself by social media,” he admitted. But Bitcoin has a way of changing a company’s relationship with visibility. Semler Scientific has attracted a new, vocal shareholder base, and Semler himself has become a reference point for other executives weighing the Bitcoin path. It’s not always comfortable, but it’s effective. “At the end of the day, really what matters is that we own a lot of Bitcoin and that Bitcoin appreciates… what matters most is… that we create shareholder value.” For Semler Scientific, Bitcoin hasn’t just altered the balance sheet—it’s pulled the company into the spotlight and into the conversation. WHY INSTITUTIONS ARE TAKING NOTICE While retail investors can access Bitcoin through spot ETFs or self-custody, many large institutional funds remain restricted by mandates that prohibit direct exposure. That dynamic creates a unique opening for publicly traded operating companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. “Most investment funds can’t buy ETFs,” Semler explained. “For a large number of the huge funds in this country, we’re really their only way to get exposure to Bitcoin in the stock market.” This limitation—little known outside institutional circles—has turned companies like Semler Scientific into proxy vehicles for Bitcoin exposure. And for fund managers who believe in the long-term thesis but can’t touch the underlying asset, firms like SMLR offer a rare bridge. As more institutions seek asymmetric upside and diversified alternatives to fiat-debasing capital environments, Semler Scientific (SMLR) is increasingly part of that capital conversation—not because of what it sells, but because of what it holds. NAVIGATING VOLATILITY When asked what advice he would give to other companies considering Bitcoin, Semler didn’t sugarcoat it. “Just be ready for volatility. If you’re comfortable with that, know that that’s gonna be part of this experience.” He recalled the company’s first major purchase. “We took almost all of our cash and bought Bitcoin in May. As soon as we finished buying, their news came out that Mt. Gox was doing a distribution. And I think Bitcoin just plummeted, like, 25% in a short period of time… it was a, you know, a hit to the stomach, a stomach punch.” But instead of pulling back, they pushed forward—raising more capital and buying more Bitcoin through both ATM equity and convertible notes. “We did 100 million dollar convertible loan.” LOOKING AHEAD Semler believes the long-term upside goes beyond “hodling.” As infrastructure matures and institutions like JPMorgan step deeper into the space, he sees potential to leverage Bitcoin for yield and financing. “I could see us being a kind of a Bitcoin financial company.” For now, the focus is clear: accumulate Bitcoin, manage volatility, and unlock value where others see risk. “We’re early in accumulating Bitcoin, and we’re gonna continue to do that.” Disclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations .

With large-cap coins showing signs of exhaustion and many speculative bets losing steam, there’s growing interest in smaller-cap projects that offer real functionality, solid tokenomics, and early-stage access. One new crypto coin that’s starting to check all those boxes is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently priced at $0.025 during its presale, Mutuum Finance has become a standout for those seeking the best crypto to invest in before the next major bull cycle begins. With forecasts already suggesting that this token could experience a dramatic price movement by 2025, it’s gaining attention as the next big cryptocurrency with real-world application, not just hype. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and why is it attracting attention? Mutuum Finance operates as a decentralized protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets without relying on third-party custody. Built on-chain, it allows users to earn passive income by supplying digital assets to shared liquidity pools or to borrow against crypto holdings by locking them up as collateral. The system operates without intermediaries, ensuring transparency, automation, and greater accessibility. What makes Mutuum stand out from the flood of new cryptocurrency projects is how closely its token, MUTM, is integrated with the platform’s core functions. When users supply assets like ETH or USDC, they receive mtTokens in return—ERC-20 tokens that represent their deposit and gradually earn yield. These mtTokens offer more than just a balance update; they give users the ability to monitor earnings in real time or even move their value across wallets or platforms. Mutuum also gives users the option to create direct lending agreements through its peer-to-peer model. This model allows for flexible loan terms, making the platform appealing to both cautious lenders and those exploring newer or more volatile digital assets. The project has already made notable progress, with over $6.4 million raised and more than 8,000 users taking part in the presale. The current price of $0.025 won’t last much longer, as Phase 4 is close to wrapping up and the next stage will raise the price to $0.03. For anyone keeping an eye on emerging cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, this entry point may be one of the last opportunities to buy in before broader exposure takes the token to new levels. Mutuum has set a maximum supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, creating a transparent framework for long-term valuation. The tokenomics are strategically built to benefit early participants and maintain sustainability over time. One of the ways the protocol accomplishes this is by linking real platform activity to token demand, ensuring that growth is tied to actual usage rather than speculation alone. Instead of relying on hype, Mutuum takes a utility-driven approach. A portion of the interest paid by borrowers is used to buy MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then distributed to users who hold mtTokens—representing their deposits—effectively rewarding those contributing to the platform’s liquidity. This creates steady buy-side pressure and encourages ongoing engagement. It’s a model that many analysts view as a strong foundation for long-term value, prompting some to name MUTM among their top cryptocurrency predictions for standout growth in 2025. Multiple factors are aligning in Mutuum’s favor: a working product in development, strong presale participation, token utility tied to platform demand, and a beta launch that’s scheduled to coincide with the token going live. When that happens, real value will be created through lending and borrowing activity—not just speculation. Mutuum is also working on launching a fully overcollateralized stablecoin, backed by on-chain assets and designed to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar, and secured by assets locked within the platform. This introduces additional use cases and could help anchor the ecosystem against broader market swings. For long-term investors asking what cryptocurrency to invest in, Mutuum offers a blend of innovation, yield generation, and long-term sustainability. As the market prepares for its next major rotation, Mutuum Finance may turn out to be one of the best cryptos to buy now before exchange listings begin and price discovery takes over. With strong fundamentals and growing visibility, this new crypto coin might just be the one to explode in 2025.

While panic grips ETH holders, one unlikely contender is racing against the tide. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a low-cap DeFi project still in its presale, is turning heads as it surges in both traction and trust. MUTM launched its fourth phase of funding during its altcoin presale where investors bought it at $0.025 while contributing over $6.5 million. More than 8100 investors have entered at the current price levels because they expect a projected 20% price surge before the upcoming stage to $0.03. The launch price at $0.06 gives investors who enter during this period the potential to receive a 140% profit. Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance attracts significant investor attention because it implements decentralized finance solutions for crypto loans together with decentralized finance funding mechanisms for its financial service development. The project grows steadily because it acquired more than $6.5 million from investors and now engages a growing number of 8100 investors. Investors face limited entry choices given a $0.025 Phase 4 token price because a 20% price boost next stage to $0.03. Investors who participate in the current presale period will receive 140% profits from their investment because the platform already set a future price at $0.06. Mutuum Finance steers the Decentralized market ahead using its innovative lending solution and its established market position. The Mutuum Finance team is working on getting its smart contract audited by Certik and once that will be finalized it will be announced on social media. The Dual-Model System of Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance operates a contemporary lending platform which combines Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models to enable better access to assets and transparency for user empowerment. Smart contract pools benefit from Peer-to-Contract Model users who supply their stablecoins for instant borrowing access by platform users and receive passive income. Thanks to automated interest rate modification through smart contracts both lenders get better earnings and borrowers experience less expense in borrowing. The P2P model enables users to form decentralized lending relationships without middlemen while obtaining full negotiation freedoms. The transparent system allows borrowers and lenders to build customized loan arrangements for transactions so they can achieve better user-friendly options. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance focuses on growing its user base through attractive rewards programs and distributes $100,000 in MUTM tokens through its $10,000 value giveaways to ten lucky participants. It also provides incentives for new member referrals. The platform provides early adopters with dedicated staking possibilities along with voting rights and priority news updates to maintain their commitment towards the platform in the long run. Transforming Crypto Lending From its base on the Ethereum platform Mutuum Finance preserves price stability through the use of USD fund deposits. The stablecoin system utilizes resistant architecture to prevent algorithmic stability problems that financial transactions require. Mutuum Finance reaches its full decentralized finance development capacity because it unites superior financial lending techniques with robust foundational systems. In light of Ethereum’s recent downturn and the mass whale sell-offs that followed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a beacon of opportunity in a turbulent market. While ETH slides to $3,320, MUTM has raised over $6.5 million and attracted more than 8,100 investors during its Phase 4 presale, where tokens are still available at just $0.025. Don’t miss your chance to join the DeFi shake-up and invest in the MUTM presale today and be part of the next-generation lending revolution.

43178815,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148312,1744306218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Pause: EU Suspends Countermeasures on US Tariffs for 90 Days – Crypto Market Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eu-pauses-us-tariffs-trade/,"In a significant development that has ripple effects across global markets, including the volatile crypto sphere, the European Union has decided to press the pause button on countermeasures targeting U.S. tariffs. This hopeful move, announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, offers a 90-day window for negotiations to defuse simmering trade tensions. But what does this mean for you, especially if you’re invested in cryptocurrencies? Let’s dive into the details. Why Did the EU Pause Countermeasures on US Tariffs? The decision to suspend countermeasures, initially slated for April 15th, comes as a gesture of goodwill and an opportunity to engage in constructive dialogue with the United States. According to Walter Bloomberg’s update on X (formerly Twitter), this 90-day reprieve is conditional. President von der Leyen explicitly warned that these countermeasures are merely paused, not canceled. If negotiations fail to yield a satisfactory resolution within this timeframe, the EU is prepared to enforce these tariffs. This stance underscores the EU’s commitment to fair trade practices while prioritizing diplomatic solutions. Previously, Bitcoin World reported on the EU’s consideration of this 90-day postponement, indicating that this decision has been anticipated and is likely a result of ongoing behind-the-scenes discussions and strategic considerations on both sides of the Atlantic. Understanding the Nuances of US Trade and EU Tariffs To grasp the significance of this pause, it’s crucial to understand what US trade policies and EU tariffs entail in this context. Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods and services. They are a tool used in international trade to protect domestic industries, generate revenue, or exert political pressure. When one country imposes tariffs on another, it can lead to retaliatory tariffs, escalating into what’s commonly known as a trade war. In this specific situation, the EU’s countermeasures are a response to existing U.S. tariffs that the EU considers unfair or detrimental to its economic interests. Suspending these countermeasures is a strategic move, indicating a preference for negotiation over confrontation, at least for now. The Impact on the Global Economy and Crypto Markets Trade disputes between major economic powers like the EU and the US have far-reaching consequences for the global economy . These disputes can: Increase uncertainty: Businesses become hesitant to invest and expand when trade relations are unstable. Disrupt supply chains: Tariffs can make imported goods more expensive, impacting production costs and consumer prices. Slow economic growth: Reduced trade and investment can dampen economic activity globally. For crypto markets , which are increasingly intertwined with the traditional financial system, these global economic shifts are particularly relevant. Here’s why: Risk-on/Risk-off sentiment: Trade tensions can trigger risk-off sentiment in markets. Investors may move away from perceived riskier assets like cryptocurrencies towards safer havens. Conversely, easing tensions can boost risk appetite. Inflationary pressures: Tariffs can contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes seen as a hedge against inflation, so inflationary environments can influence crypto investment. Global interconnectedness: The crypto market is inherently global. Trade disputes impacting major economies can indirectly affect crypto trading volumes, investor sentiment, and regulatory approaches worldwide. Trade Negotiations: What’s at Stake? The 90-day pause is all about creating space for meaningful trade negotiations . What are the key objectives and potential sticking points in these discussions? Area of Negotiation EU Objectives US Objectives Potential Challenges Tariff Reduction/Removal Seek removal or significant reduction of existing US tariffs on EU goods. Potentially seek reciprocal tariff reductions from the EU, or maintain leverage. Differing priorities on specific sectors; political pressures to protect domestic industries. Regulatory Cooperation Aim for greater alignment in regulations to reduce trade barriers. Seek to ensure EU regulations do not unfairly disadvantage US businesses. Divergent regulatory philosophies and standards; sovereignty concerns. Dispute Resolution Mechanisms Establish clear and efficient mechanisms for resolving future trade disputes. Ensure dispute resolution processes are fair and balanced. Finding mutually acceptable processes that respect each party’s legal frameworks. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? For those navigating the crypto markets, staying informed about these EU tariffs and US trade developments is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Negotiation Progress: Keep an eye on news and official statements regarding the EU-US trade talks. Any indication of progress or setbacks can influence market sentiment. Assess Risk Appetite: Gauge the overall risk appetite in the market. Easing trade tensions could signal a move towards risk-on assets, potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies. Diversify Your Portfolio: Economic uncertainty underscores the importance of portfolio diversification. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed on Regulatory Fronts: Trade disputes can sometimes trigger shifts in regulatory focus. Be aware of any potential regulatory changes in the crypto space that might arise from broader economic or political shifts. A Breath of Fresh Air or Just a Temporary Lull? The EU’s decision to pause countermeasures offers a welcome respite from escalating trade tensions. It signals a willingness to pursue dialogue and avoid a full-blown trade war, which would be detrimental to all parties involved. For the crypto market, this hopeful pause can be interpreted as a positive sign, potentially reducing immediate economic uncertainty and fostering a more stable investment environment. However, it’s essential to remember that this is just a 90-day window. The underlying issues and disagreements remain. Whether this pause leads to a lasting resolution or is merely a temporary lull before renewed tensions depends heavily on the success of the upcoming negotiations. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and prepared for potential shifts in the global economy and their impact on the ever-dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

Or perhaps the global economic winds of change are making you uneasy? You’re not alone. As traditional markets brace for impact from tariff wars and economic uncertainties, savvy investors are seeking refuge in a time-tested safe haven, now reimagined for the digital age: tokenized gold . Why is Tokenized Gold Trading Volume Exploding? This week marked a significant milestone in the world of digital assets. Tokenized gold trading volume has surged past a staggering $1 billion, reaching levels not seen in two years. This monumental rise, as reported by Cointelegraph, isn’t just a random spike; it’s a clear indicator of shifting investor sentiment driven by the escalating global economic uncertainty fueled by U.S. tariff policies. But what exactly is driving this gold rush towards digital tokens? Economic Uncertainty: President Trump’s tariff policies are creating ripples of anxiety across global markets. The fear of trade wars and economic slowdowns is pushing investors to seek safer ground. Safe-Haven Appeal: Gold has historically been considered a safe-haven asset during times of economic turmoil. Its inherent value and limited supply make it an attractive alternative to volatile stocks and fiat currencies. Digital Accessibility: Tokenization makes gold more accessible and tradable than ever before. Fractional ownership, ease of transfer, and 24/7 trading on crypto exchanges are democratizing access to this precious metal. Tokenized Gold: A Modern Twist on a Classic Safe Haven But what exactly is tokenized gold ? Imagine owning a piece of physical gold, but instead of storing it in a vault, you hold a digital token that represents that ownership. Each token is typically pegged to the price of one gram or one ounce of physical gold, which is securely stored in vaults. This ingenious system combines the stability of gold with the efficiency and accessibility of blockchain technology. Feature Traditional Gold Tokenized Gold Accessibility Can be cumbersome to buy, store, and sell physical gold. Easily accessible and tradable on crypto exchanges 24/7. Fractional Ownership Difficult to invest in small amounts of physical gold. Allows for fractional ownership, making it accessible to smaller investors. Storage & Security Requires secure storage and insurance. Gold is securely vaulted; tokens are held in digital wallets. Transferability Physical gold transfer can be complex and costly. Tokens can be transferred quickly and easily across borders. Transparency Provenance and purity can be opaque. Blockchain provides transparency and traceability. Navigating Tariff Uncertainty with Digital Gold: Is it the Right Move for You? With global tariff uncertainty looming large, investors are actively seeking strategies to protect their wealth. Tokenized gold presents itself as a compelling option, but is it the right choice for everyone? Let’s delve into the potential benefits and challenges. Benefits of Investing in Tokenized Gold: Hedge Against Inflation: Gold is often considered an inflation hedge, preserving value during periods of rising prices. Portfolio Diversification: Adding tokenized gold to your portfolio can diversify risk and potentially enhance returns. Safe Haven Asset: As we’ve seen, gold tends to perform well during economic downturns and market volatility. Ease of Use: Trading tokenized gold is similar to trading other cryptocurrencies, making it user-friendly for crypto enthusiasts. Lower Barriers to Entry: Fractional ownership allows investors to start with smaller investments compared to physical gold. Challenges and Considerations: Custodial Risk: While the underlying gold is vaulted, you are still relying on the token issuer and exchange for security. Choose reputable platforms. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for tokenized assets is still evolving, which could introduce some uncertainty. Market Volatility: While gold itself is less volatile than crypto, the price of tokenized gold can still be influenced by crypto market fluctuations. Counterparty Risk: Understand who is backing the token and where the physical gold is stored. Transparency is key. Examples of Tokenized Gold Platforms Several platforms are now offering digital gold tokens, each with its own nuances. Some popular examples include: PAX Gold (PAXG): One of the leading tokenized gold options, each PAXG token represents one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold, stored in Brink’s vaults. Tether Gold (XAUT): Issued by Tether, XAUT tokens also represent ownership of physical gold stored in Swiss vaults. Digix Gold (DGX): DGX tokens represent 1 gram of 99.99% gold stored in Singapore vaults. Perth Mint Gold Token (PMGT): Backed by gold held by The Perth Mint, a government entity. Before diving in, it’s crucial to research each platform, understand their custody arrangements, and assess their reputation. Look for transparency, audits, and clear terms of service. Actionable Insights: How to Get Started with Tokenized Gold Investment Interested in exploring safe-haven assets like tokenized gold? Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started: Research Platforms: Compare different tokenized gold platforms, considering factors like fees, security, reputation, and gold storage locations. Choose a Reputable Exchange: Select a cryptocurrency exchange that lists the tokenized gold you want to trade and has a strong security track record. Understand Custody: Learn about how the underlying gold is stored and secured. Look for platforms with transparent custody arrangements and regular audits. Start Small: Begin with a small investment to familiarize yourself with the process and manage risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market trends, regulatory developments, and platform updates in the tokenized gold space. The Billion-Dollar Milestone: A Testament to Digital Gold’s Growing Appeal The surge in trading volume to over $1 billion for tokenized gold is not just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful signal. It highlights the growing acceptance and adoption of digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles, particularly in times of uncertainty. As global economic landscapes continue to shift, and as the lines between traditional finance and decentralized technologies blur, tokenized gold is poised to play an increasingly significant role in the future of investment. In conclusion, the remarkable rise of tokenized gold trading volume underscores a fundamental shift in investor behavior. In a world grappling with economic uncertainties and market volatility, the allure of a digital, accessible, and time-tested safe haven like gold is proving irresistible. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or new to the world of digital assets, exploring tokenized gold might just be your golden opportunity to navigate the turbulent waters ahead.

To read full editions, subscribe . Truth Arts — formerly known as Truth Labs, the team behind the 2022 Goblintown Ethereum NFT collection — has released NFT “licenses” inspired by driver’s licenses. To become eligible to mint a Goblintown license, aspiring drivers had to wait for a seemingly endless amount of time with no end in sight in a DMV. In this case, the wait was at the Goblintown DMV, which was a webpage with a DMV simulator. You took a number, waited, waited some more, and ultimately submitted your email address to the team. (You also need to create a DYLI account with that same email address to claim your license.) When I stumbled upon the DMV simulator shortly after it launched April 1, I didn’t know what the endgame was, but I figured it would probably end in some exclusive reward. I clicked on it to check it out. I took a number, saw the depressing knowledge of a long wait and some extremely high numbers (like 99,999), and gave up after about 30 seconds. I had work to do, okay? Truth CEO and cofounder Alexander Taub said in a post that wait times were anywhere from one to five hours per customer. The Goblintown DMV is now closed. If you didn’t get the chance to pass idle hours waiting, the NFTs can be bought on secondary marketplaces. The “license” NFTs can be claimed until this Friday, April 11, according to an X post . They’re minting on the Abstract blockchain. There are six possible character designs: “pumplescroob,” “lord buttbat,” “jug,” “gromblar,” “urki,” and “gobbie.” When asked why the Goblintown team chose Abstract for its latest NFTs, Taub told Blockworks via email: “We are big fans and friends of Luca, Pudgy Penguins, and the Abstract team. The licenses were first and foremost something that we wanted people to be able to physically redeem (if they choose to),” he said, adding: “We are also building more things for Abstract, this just happened to leapfrog those things.” The NFTs can be “burned,” or removed from the blockchain permanently, in exchange for real-life physical versions of the licenses. The licenses are thematically tied to the upcoming Goblintown racing game, Goblintown: Really Hard Driving Game , which was announced back in February. It’s technically not a crypto game, though. The game won’t require any NFTs to play, but it won’t be free-to-play, either (exact pricing is TBD). “This game is very purposefully a non-Web3 game. The first reason is that you cannot have anything crypto- or token-related and be in good standing on Steam, which is where we will be first distributing the game. This is the number one marketplace for indie games, so that made the decision for us,” Taub explained. “The second reason is we wanted to make a game that is fun and entertaining and something people WANT to play, not because they might make money or speculate on it. We are building an entertainment and technology company, and creating entertaining games is something we need to deliver on outside of speculative digital assets. So the game has IP origins with Goblintown and our original digital collection, but it is our attempt to build ourselves into a character IP brand,” the CEO continued. On April 20, Goblintown is hosting an IRL event in New York City where invitees can try to beat the game for $10,000 in cash. The game will also be on offer IRL at Pax East in Boston next month and at DreamHack in Dallas at the end of next month. At all of these events, those with NFT licenses will be able to cut the line to play the game. “We figure you waited at the digital DMV for a minimum of an hour (to 5 hours!), so we can let you skip the line. In the future, we might come up with more fun little things, but tying it to the actual in-game is not something we plan to do,” Taub told Blockworks. Like Really Hard Driving Game’s title suggests, it’s intended to be very difficult to play. “This isn’t just about skill — it’s about nerves, instinct, and maybe a little bit of chaos. Goblintown has always thrived on unpredictability, and this challenge is no exception,” Taub said in a press release. Goblintown: Really Hard Driving Game has echoes of Yuga Labs’ Dookey Dash, which was a difficult driving game with obstacles that was released for a limited time beginning in January 2023. The original Dookey Dash was also for degens and competitive gamers, but it required a “Sewer Pass” NFT to access the game. The winning Dookey Dash key ultimately sold for $1.6 million in February 2023. In September 2024, Yuga Labs released a free-to-play, newer version of the game. Goblintown’s Really Hard Driving Game will launch before the end of this month, Taub confirmed to Blockworks. Get the news in your inbox.

Despite Trump’s rapid implementation of wide-ranging import tariffs in recent days, which has rocked Bitcoin’s price, head researchers from Bitwise still expect the top asset to spring to new heights this year. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has said that the firm’s $200,000 year-end price target for Bitcoin remains unchanged. Bitcoin Still to Hit $200,000 in 2025 “In December, Bitwise predicted that Bitcoin would end the year at $200,000. I still think that’s in play,” Matt Hougan wrote in an April 9 blog post. He believes the fallout from this month’s trade policy from the White House could be a boon for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market as his administration “wants a weaker dollar, even if it means ending its role as the world’s reserve currency.” Hougan referenced an April 7 speech by the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Steve Miran, which slammed the dollar’s hegemony as causing “persistent currency distortions” and “unsustainable trade deficits” that have “decimated” American manufacturing. Bitcoin’s price recently fell below $75,000 as investors digested Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. However, markets sharply rebounded Wednesday after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for more than 75 nations. However, China, which recently slapped the US with steep retaliatory tariffs, did not get any relief, as Trump hiked the levies to 125%. The Bitwise exec suggested that a weak dollar could have both short-term and long-term effects on Bitcoin. He explained that dollar weakness has historically correlated with Bitcoin’s strength, citing the US Dollar Index. “Dollar down equals Bitcoin up,” Hougan said. “I expect this pattern will continue.” Hougan believes the disruption to the global reserve currency system in the long term presents opportunities for alternative reserve assets such as gold and BTC: “Governments and companies turn to the dollar for international trade precisely because of its stability. When that stability comes into question, they have to look elsewhere.” In conclusion, the pundit predicted that the world will shift from a single reserve currency system to a “more fractured” one, with hard money like the largest crypto by market cap and the precious metal playing a more significant role than they currently do. BTC is up 5.5% over the past 24 hours to $81,289, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko . It’s down around 30% from its all-time high of nearly $109,000 set on Jan. 20 ahead of Trump’s inauguration.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-10 17:34:30

However, he said his intention was to avoid triggering a widespread depression. Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper reported that Trump had told advisers he was prepared to accept the economic “pain” that the tariff strategy could cause, though mounting bond market pressure forced a partial reversal of the policy. The plan, which includes significant tariffs aimed at protecting U.S. industries, has raised fears among economists that disruptions to global trade could slow economic growth. While a recession is increasingly seen as a possibility, experts have not foreseen the more serious consequences of a depression, which historically includes prolonged economic downturns and rising unemployment. The U.S. has not experienced a depression since the Great Depression of the 1930s, when unemployment reached 25%. Economists say stronger fiscal tools, monetary policy and federal safeguards such as FDIC deposit insurance have helped prevent such extremes in modern times. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces It Will List Three Surprise Altcoins in Futures Financial markets responded quickly to the policy shock. Bond yields rose while stocks fell, triggering investor anxiety. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly rose above 4.5% on speculation that major bondholders such as Japan and China were dumping U.S. bonds. As yields rose, bond prices fell. Trump eventually rolled back tariffs on some countries on Wednesday, helping markets recover. The S&P 500 posted its strongest single-day gain since 2008. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC that the turmoil in the bond market added urgency to Trump’s move. “There’s no doubt that what happened in the bond market yesterday added perhaps a little bit more urgency to the decision,” Hassett said. Trump said in his comments after the backpedal that markets had overreacted: “I thought people got a little bit out of line,” he said, adding: “They got a little excited, they got a little scared.” Another factor in the shift, according to the WSJ, has been Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s growing influence in trade negotiations. The sources said the growing number of countries negotiating with the U.S. has also contributed to Trump’s openness to changing his approach. *This is not investment advice.

The firm advocates for a regulatory approach that recognizes how blockchain systems operate, including on-chain governance and staking. The proposal challenges binary distinctions between wallet types, favoring a risk-based model. a16z also calls for flexibility in asset transfers and support for layered custody arrangements common in digital asset infrastructure. Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz submitted a comment letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 9, proposing a new framework for how registered investment advisers (RIAs) should be allowed to custody digital assets. The firm argued that current rules fail to account for how crypto custody operates in practice. It recommended that self-custody be permitted under certain conditions, especially where third-party options are unavailable or impractical. a16z Calls on SEC to Recognize Self-Custody a16z proposed five “Crypto Custody Principles,” calling for greater flexibility and a shift away from traditional custody models that do not account for how blockchains function. At the core of the proposal is a request to allow RIAs to engage in self-custody when no viable third-party custodians exist, provided they meet clear standards for security and internal controls. The letter urges the SEC to adopt a technology-neutral approach, allowing advisers to participate in on-chain governance and staking without being treated as if they have relinquished custody. It also recommends that blockchain-based systems be recognized for satisfying disclosure and recordkeeping requirements under existing rules. The firm pushed back on rigid distinctions between hot and cold wallets, advocating instead for a risk-based framework that accounts for how custodians use tools like MPC, multisig wallets, and hardware-based protections. The @SECGov just released excellent guidance on stablecoins — clearly identifying where they fall outside the scope of securities laws. While the guidance mostly focuses on centrally-issued stablecoins, there are some implications for decentralized stablecoins.

The letter further recommends acknowledging layered custody structures, where subcustodians and infrastructure providers support primary custodians, as common and necessary in the crypto ecosystem. a16z cautioned that without modernized guidance, advisers may be discouraged from participating in crypto markets altogether. “Advisers should not be required to choose between regulatory compliance and operational reality,” the letter states. The letter suggests a broader challenge regulators now face: how to adapt legal structures built for centralized systems to assets that are native to distributed ones. Custody, in this context, becomes less about who holds the keys and more about how authority, risk, and accountability are defined. For advisers, the consequences are not abstract. Without a framework that reflects how digital assets actually function, the cost of participation rises—measured not only in compliance risk, but in access forfeited to a growing segment of financial infrastructure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): What custody rules currently apply to investment advisers? Advisers must use qualified custodians and ensure clients receive account statements directly from them. What changed with SAB 121 being rescinded? Custodians no longer need to report held crypto as liabilities, removing a key barrier for banks. Why does the hot vs. cold wallet distinction matter? Hot wallets are more exposed to online threats; cold wallets are safer but less accessible. a16z wants risk, not connectivity, to define policy. What’s a subcustody model in crypto? It’s when a custodian partners with a specialized provider to handle crypto operations, common in layered custody setups.

Murphy filed a February Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to get the information but was refused. He now needs a lawsuit to get the information he wants. He based his lawsuit on Rana Saoud, DHS Special Agent, who claimed at a conference in April 2019 that her colleagues met with four people who created Bitcoin. Rana Saoud, at an OffshoreAlert Conference 2019, an event focused on financial intelligence gathering, revealed that her agency identified the people behind Bitcoin and interviewed them. Murphy has taken these comments seriously and has filed a FOIA request. Brian Field, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney who specialises in FOIA-related litigation, has joined Murphy in his lawsuit. A FOIA boosts transparency and accountability by giving the public access to government documents. Murphy, however, concedes that the DHS agents may have been mistaken and did not interview the real Satoshi Nakamoto. At the conference, Saoud claimed that the DHS had located Satoshi and three other developers who had created Bitcoin as a team. According to Saoud, the DHS agent asked Satoshi what the purpose of Bitcoin was. Satoshi explained how Bitcoin worked and why it was created. The DHS has never confirmed nor denied Saoud’s claims. Murphy has requested interview notes, emails about the case, and any other records related to the case. Saoud further claimed that a forward-thinking DHS agent took the initiative to interview Satoshi. The department pushed back on the request but, in the end, allowed a team of DHS agents to interview the alleged Satoshi. The meeting took place in California. The DHS agents, led by the “brilliant” agent, discovered that Satoshi collaborated with three other people to create Bitcoin. However, Murphy doubts that the DHS agent interviewed the real Satoshi Nakamoto, suggesting that Saoud may have misinterpreted the incident. He suggests that the DHS agent may have interviewed some developers or imposters pretending to be Satoshi. Murphy believes that the identity of Satoshi should be made known because other crypto currencies are clear about who made them. The public has a right to know about this information if the government knows the details. Murphy, however, believes the information should remain secret if it poses a national security risk. He also claims that Satoshi’s identity, if revealed, would benefit Bitcoin because more people would become aware of the digital asset. He dismisses the claim that Satoshi could take over Bitcoin because the decentralised nature of the token prevents such from happening. On February 12, Murphy attempted to obtain a FOIA through the regular process, requesting four categories of records relating to Saoud’s 2019 statements. He requested information about whether the DHS interviewed anyone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto, whether there were any interviews with people claiming to have invented Bitcoin, and whether there were any records discussing Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity. However, his request was denied. Last year, HBO aired a documentary claiming that Peter Todd, a cypherpunk, was Satoshi Nakamoto . Critics, however, said the evidence was weak. Nick Szabo is often suspected of creating Bitcoin because of his ties to crypto and writings about digital currencies. However, little evidence has been given to support this claim. Hal Finney is another possibility, having developed proof-of-work algorithms and sadly passing away as Satoshi slowly disappeared from the public eye. However, one researcher pointed out that Hal Finney was running a marathon while Satoshi posted on the forum. Gavin Andresen, meanwhile, remains a Satoshi candidate that the documentaries or books have not covered. Gavin was the lead developer of Bitcoin after Satoshi left. On 24 May 2007, Gavin wrote a post titled “Tragedy of the email commons” on his blog GavinTech, where he outlined a rough plan to create an “artificial currency” to control spam. The first version of Bitcoin was released on January 9, 2009. Further, Gavin wears a ‘Satoshi outfit’ on his X account and did a comic routine at a Bitcoin conference, pretending to be Satoshi Nakamoto.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Satoshi Nakamoto,EN,0,0,BTC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-10 17:40:09

This case, which is now lingering, suggests the banking regulator is using delay tactics in adhering to previous court orders. Coinbase Versus FDIC: What is New? A court filing from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia revealed that the FDIC had asked for an additional 16 days to decide if it needed even more time to respond to Coinbase’s FOIA request. The filing is part of History Associates’ lawsuit against the FDIC on behalf of Coinbase. The firm demands records about the FDIC’s alleged role in discouraging banks from working with cryptocurrency companies. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal strongly criticized the FDIC’s move in his X post . He said it was unacceptable for the agency to ask for more time when it missed multiple deadlines. Per the recent court document, Jonathan C. Bond and Paul Grewal said the FDIC’s conduct showed a clear pattern of delay and resistance. They pointed out that the agency had released documents so heavily redacted that they revealed almost nothing of value. This follows earlier concerns raised by the exchange, where it blamed the FDIC for refusing to cooperate in its request for records related to Operation Choke Point 2.0. According to reports, the lawsuit was filed in February 2024. Since then, Coinbase said the FDIC’s actions go against the transparency rules set by FOIA laws. Victory Over FDIC and Implications Coinbase has recorded an important victory in this FDIC case since it started. A court order asked the FDIC to release the requested document, a move the agency complied with, with a caveat. On March 15, 2025, the exchange raised issues with how the FDIC handled its FOIA request concerning Operation Choke Point 2.0. The few documents that were handed over revealed little because of redactions. This case could affect how government agencies respond to future FOIA requests from companies in the crypto space. If Coinbase succeeds, it may force federal agencies to be more open in their dealings with digital asset firms, setting a precedent that could benefit the broader industry. Coinbase Exchange and the US SEC It is worth mentioning that Coinbase is also engaged in a separate FOIA dispute with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. As reported earlier by CoinGape, the top crypto exchange bagged a win in the case as the court warned the SEC of possible sanctions. On March 28, 2025, Judge Ana Reyes denied the agency’s request for more time and ordered it to meet an April 11 deadline to release key documents. The exchange’s demands hinge on the discovery of the financial records expended by the US SEC in its crypto crackdowns.

The abrupt reversal results from a tariff-for-tariff standoff between Beijing and Washington, where the former feels “disrespected” by President Donald Trump’s insistence on raising tariffs on Chinese imports. According to a Thursday report from Politico, the deal to spin TikTok’s US business into a new American-owned entity had been finalized. It was set for public announcement just days before a legal deadline. Under the terms of the agreement, US investors would take majority ownership and control of the video app’s American operations, sources familiar with the negotiations said. ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company of TikTok, would have retained only a minority stake to satisfy the Trump administration’s mandate for Chinese divestment. Beijing kills TikTok deal after new tariff hikes Sources now say the agreement fell apart as early as last week, when President Donald Trump imposed a “retaliatory” extra 34% tariff on Chinese imports, resonating the increase to what he called “China’s continued abuse of global trade norms.” The next day, ByteDance representatives informed the White House that Beijing would no longer approve the divestiture. Last Friday, Trump signed an executive order to extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations by 75 days, moving it to June 19. Trump then went on to add the tariff rate on Chinese goods on Wednesday to 125% and accused China of showing “a lack of respect to the World’s Markets.” At the same time, he reduced tariffs on other countries to 10% for a 90-day negotiation period. China President Xi Jinping and his camp were not happy about this, and the government’s decision to block the transaction could be a vengeful response to Trump’s trade penalties. “ They’re using Trump’s own strategy against him ,” said Bill Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “ They’re showing they can retaliate without harming themselves while still targeting a political priority for the White House. ” President Trump’s modus operandi is to use tariffs to bring more countries to his negotiation table, which analysts say has blurred the lines between diplomacy and economics. In his first term, he threatened import duties on Mexico to pressure immigration enforcement and linked military cooperation with South Korea and Germany to trade concessions. For Trump 2.0, he has expanded that approach, imposing tariffs and sanctions to pressure countries like Colombia and Canada to agree to new terms on border enforcement and deportation protocols. Trump and the US want control over the TikTok app, which more than 170 million Americans use. The administration insists the platform is a national security threat because it is China-owned and has demanded a sale to US investors as a condition for continued operation within the United States. Vice President JD Vance, who has been leading the negotiations, will have to find a way to expedite the stalled process, with one person close to his team calling it a “waiting game.” White House still confident about TikTok deal President Trump said he is still optimistic about the deal’s future, even when heads are still hot over trade differences. “ We have a deal with some very good people, some very rich companies that would do a great job with it ,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. “ It’s on the table, very much. But we’re going to have to wait and see what happens with China .” On Capitol Hill, several lawmakers opposed to the deal query the legality of Trump’s actions and the security implications of any remaining Chinese ownership. Senators Mark Warner and Ed Markey argue that the president does not have legal authority to extend the deadline. Warner also propounded that the terms of the current proposal would not meet existing legal requirements. Senator Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that any American investor in a compromised TikTok deal should not expect protection from Congress. “ To any American who wants to invest in some half-assed TikTok deal, Congress will never protect you from going into business with Communist China, ” Cotton said. Markey introduced legislation to extend the divestment deadline to October, but it was blocked in the Senate on Wednesday. Under the law passed last year, TikTok was required to cease operations in the US by January 19 unless ByteDance had sold its American assets. President Trump, who began his second term on January 20, has twice extended enforcement deadlines to give room for more negotiations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

On April 9, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized exchanges to begin listing options contracts tied to spot Ether ( ETH ) ETFs after greenlighting Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF options in September. However, issuers are still waiting for the regulator to allow Ether ETFs to offer staking after filing numerous requests for permission earlier this year. Source: James Seyffart The approval of options contracts could represent a key step toward regulatory approval for staking services in the United States. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said on April 9 that clearance for staking on ETH funds could come as early as May but would likely take until the end of 2025. “It's possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October,” Seyffart said in a post on the X platform. “Potential intermediate deadlines before the final approval (or denial) are in late May & late August.” Options are financial derivatives that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price before a certain date. Staking, on the other hand, involves locking up a cryptocurrency, like ETH, to support network operations — such as validating transactions — in exchange for rewards. In ETH funds, options contracts allow investors to hedge or speculate on the tokens' prices, while staking offers a way to earn rewards by participating in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network. Ether ETF inflows. Source: Farside Investors Related: SEC approves options on spot Ether ETFs Progress toward adoption Ether ETFs launched in June 2024 but struggled to attract significant investor interest. According to data from Farside Investors, the funds have seen net inflows of $2.4 billion as of April 10, compared to $35 billion for Bitcoin ETFs introduced in January. Analysts say the SEC’s approval of Ether ETF options could help spur adoption . Asset managers are also waiting on the SEC to greenlight requests to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. The emergence of options markets tied to spot crypto ETFs is a “monumental advancement” in crypto markets and creates “extremely compelling opportunities” for investors,” Jeff Park, Bitwise Invest’s head of alpha strategies, said in a Sept. 20 X post . But staking could be the most significant step forward for Ether funds. In March, Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, said Ether ETFs are “less perfect” without staking . “A staking yield is a meaningful part of how you can generate investment return in this space.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-10 17:42:35

The settlement comes after regulators uncovered serious weaknesses in the company’s anti-money laundering (AML) program. This is particularly true within its Cash App platform, which allows users to send money and buy Bitcoin (BTC). Cash App Expanded Without Adequate Compliance Measures According to the NYDFS, Block’s compliance systems did not grow with the company. As Cash App expanded and began offering Bitcoin services, the systems meant to detect and prevent illegal financial activity were not strong enough. Investigators found that high-risk Bitcoin transactions were processed without proper review, allowing users to move funds anonymously. The investigation also revealed that Block did not have enough controls to check customer identities or assess the risk of certain transactions. These are key requirements for financial companies operating in New York. Block To Employ Measures to Oversee Compliance Improvements Block must hire an independent monitor to review its compliance systems and report back to regulators as part of the settlement. This ensures the company makes the necessary improvements and follows all applicable laws. The $40 million payment addresses past violations, but it is not Block’s first time paying such a penalty. Earlier this year, Block paid $80 million to 48 other state regulators over similar AML failures. Block has now stated that this agreement with New York marks the end of all its pending investigations with state regulators. Block Responds to Settlement Block did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement. However, the company stated that it has taken steps to improve its AML program. According to a spokesperson, Block has invested heavily in compliance resources. It was revealed the company had made necessary changes to strengthen its financial oversight, particularly within Cash App’s Bitcoin services. This case shows how important it is for financial technology companies to maintain strong compliance systems, especially when handling cryptocurrencies. As companies grow and expand their services, their responsibility to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes increases. New York and U.S. Regulators continue holding private firms and exchanges accountable. This is to ensure the safety and integrity of the financial system.

Hayes argued that a devalued CNY would result in Chinese capital flight and further flight into Bitcoin. He cautioned traders not to ignore China when making Bitcoin trades. He pointed out that similar price movements occurred in 2013 and 2015. “The U.S. is now pursuing”, wrote Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, “full-scale economic pressure on China, which may be forced to respond with quantitative easing and a currency devaluation. If so– and if China permits capital flight– Bitcoin could surge, much like it did in 2015”. Hayes believes that mounting pressure on China, including a trade war, tariffs, and economic stress, leads to economic weakness. He has been preparing for the inflow of capital by “nibbling” a little bit at a time, buying Bitcoin predominately, while holding out for the short term on altcoins, believing that Bitcoin dominance could hit 70%. He claims that ‘money printing’ is a popular method the Chinese central bank uses and feels confident that an injection of money will boost Bitcoin’s price dramatically. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has set the daily CNY at 7.2038, the weakest since September. The 7.2 level has been seen as a hard resistance level. A move above this level could indicate a systematic depreciation of the CNY. There have only been a few times that the level has been breached since 2022. Unlike the U.S. dollar, the CNY is not free floating and is restricted to trade 2% on either side of the announced level. A depreciated CNY would create cheaper Chinese experts, offsetting the negative effects of the American tariffs. Xu Tianchen, an economist, argued that an extra tariff against Chinese goods would not make much of a difference because the tariff rate is already at 60%, meaning that trade is already diminished, and further reductions would be akin to reducing trade when there was no trade to begin with. Chinese state institutions have been doing everything possible to stabilise the local economy, preparing for an unpredictable trade war from an unpredictable president, injecting liquidity into the markets, and buying up shares to withstand the negative effects of increased tariffs. Capital flight may occur if there are increased risks to China’s recovery efforts regarding the economy, and this is especially relevant to export markets because China engages in trade across the globe. Hayes, the founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange, interprets recent events not through the lens of an economist but rather as a trader. China and America have disagreed on policy decisions, with tit-for-tat exchanges between the two countries escalating into what now looks like a fully fledged trade war. For Hayes, a weakened CNY would be the logical choice for China because it represents an aggressive response with minimal consequences. The CNY has been trending downwards against the U.S. dollar, reaching five-year lows. Hayes believes Monetary policy is China’s greatest weapon against U.S. trade wars. Historically, Bitcoin has often increased in price when the CNY was weakened. Ben Zhou, co-founder of Bybit, agrees with Hayes that a weakened CNY would be a good sign for the Bitcoin price, citing historical records that confirm this trend. Zhou concludes that China will most likely devalue their currency to offset the negative effects of American tariffs. In 2015, China devalued its currency by 2%. Bitcoin, as a result, had large price movements on the upside. At first, Bitcoin dropped 20%, but then soared 60% upwards over the next four months. A ratio between CNY and USD could be used to measure the potential impact on Bitcoin. 2019, for instance, the ratio hit 7 to 1, and large movements occurred for Bitcoin. Therefore, a trade war between China and America could catapult Bitcoin, including other digital assets, into unexplored territory.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-10 17:48:11

43179774,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148335,1744308007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Claim: PlanB Declares Ethereum Irrelevant as ETH/BTC Plunges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/planb-ethereum-irrelevant-ethbtc-plunge/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The always outspoken analyst PlanB has just dropped a bombshell, igniting a firestorm of debate across the crypto sphere. His latest pronouncement? Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is teetering on the brink of irrelevance. This isn’t just another market prediction; it’s a direct challenge to Ethereum’s position, delivered with PlanB’s signature bluntness. But what’s fueling this dramatic statement, and what does it mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto market ? Why PlanB is Calling Ethereum Irrelevant PlanB, known for his Bitcoin price models and often provocative takes, didn’t mince words in his recent X post. He pointed to the alarming decline of the ETH/BTC ratio , which has sunk below 0.02 BTC, a level last seen in March 2016. For context, the ETH/BTC ratio is a crucial metric that reflects Ethereum’s value relative to Bitcoin. A falling ratio indicates that Ethereum is losing ground against Bitcoin, suggesting weaker investor confidence or a shift in market preference. Here’s a breakdown of PlanB’s core criticisms of Ethereum: Centralization Concerns: PlanB argues that Ethereum’s development and governance are overly centralized, contrasting it with Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. He implies this centralization makes Ethereum vulnerable and less aligned with the core principles of cryptocurrency. Pre-mine Accusations: The term “pre-mined” is often used negatively in the crypto world, suggesting an unfair initial distribution of tokens. PlanB highlights Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) and token distribution as a point of contention, implying it gave early investors an undue advantage. Proof-of-Work Critique: While Ethereum has transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), PlanB criticizes its departure from Proof-of-Work (PoW), the consensus mechanism that secures Bitcoin. He suggests PoW is superior in terms of security and decentralization. Origin of “Low-Quality” Projects: This is a sweeping statement, but PlanB suggests that Ethereum’s platform has facilitated the proliferation of numerous less credible crypto projects, potentially diluting the overall quality and reputation of the crypto space. In essence, PlanB’s argument paints a picture of Ethereum as a project that has strayed from the ideals of decentralization and sound money, ultimately questioning its long-term relevance in a market dominated by Bitcoin’s principles. But is this a fair assessment, or is there more to the story? The Plummeting ETH/BTC Ratio: A Cause for Alarm? The ETH/BTC ratio is indeed a significant indicator. When it falls, it signals that investors are favoring Bitcoin over Ethereum. This could be due to various factors, including: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of market uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived safer haven within the volatile crypto market . Bitcoin’s established history and brand recognition contribute to this perception. Bitcoin’s Narrative Strength: Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” and a store of value remains powerful, especially amidst economic instability or inflation concerns. Ethereum’s Evolving Narrative: Ethereum’s narrative has shifted from solely being “digital oil” for applications to encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and more. While diverse, this evolving narrative might be less clear-cut and consistently compelling to some investors compared to Bitcoin’s simpler value proposition. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate hikes, and regulatory uncertainties can impact the entire crypto market , often leading to capital flowing into the most established assets like Bitcoin first. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is cyclical. Ratios fluctuate, and what seems like a dire trend today might reverse tomorrow. To get a balanced perspective, let’s consider the other side of the argument. Is Ethereum Truly Irrelevant? Counterarguments and Perspectives While PlanB raises valid points, dismissing Ethereum as “irrelevant” might be premature and overly simplistic. Here’s why: Ethereum’s Thriving Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active ecosystem in the crypto space. It’s the foundation for countless decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces. This vibrant ecosystem generates real-world utility and economic activity. Technological Advancements: Ethereum has undergone significant upgrades, most notably “The Merge,” transitioning to Proof-of-Stake. This move has addressed energy consumption concerns and paved the way for further scalability improvements like sharding. Developer Community Strength: Ethereum has a massive and dedicated developer community constantly innovating and building on the platform. This continuous development is vital for long-term growth and adaptation. Institutional Adoption: Despite centralization concerns, institutions are increasingly exploring and investing in Ethereum and its ecosystem. The demand for DeFi and tokenized assets is growing within traditional finance. Beyond Store of Value: Ethereum’s value proposition extends beyond being just a store of value like Bitcoin . It aims to be a global computing platform, powering a new generation of internet applications. This utility could drive long-term demand and value. It’s also important to note that comparing Ethereum directly to Bitcoin as a one-to-one competition might be misleading. They serve different purposes and cater to different needs within the broader crypto market . The Future of ETH/BTC and the Crypto Market Landscape The ETH/BTC ratio will likely continue to fluctuate, influenced by market cycles, technological developments, and investor sentiment. A prolonged period of Bitcoin dominance, as reflected in a declining ratio, could signal a shift towards simpler, more established crypto assets during times of uncertainty. However, a resurgence of innovation and risk appetite in the crypto market could easily see capital flowing back into Ethereum and other altcoins, potentially driving the ETH/BTC ratio upwards again. The ongoing development of Layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, for example, could significantly improve its scalability and usability, potentially boosting its appeal. Ultimately, the “relevance” of Ethereum is subjective and depends on one’s perspective. If relevance is defined solely by sound money principles and decentralization purity, then PlanB’s critique might hold weight. However, if relevance encompasses innovation, ecosystem growth, and real-world utility, then Ethereum remains a highly significant and impactful force in the crypto market . Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors take away from this debate? Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio across different crypto assets, including both Bitcoin and Ethereum , can help mitigate risk and capture potential upside. Understand Your Investment Thesis: Clearly define why you are investing in a particular cryptocurrency. Do you believe in Bitcoin’s store of value narrative? Or Ethereum’s potential as a global computing platform? Understanding your thesis helps you make informed decisions. Monitor Key Metrics: Keep an eye on metrics like the ETH/BTC ratio , but don’t rely on a single indicator. Consider a range of factors, including on-chain activity, developer updates, and macroeconomic trends. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow opinions, even from prominent analysts like PlanB. Conduct thorough research on any crypto project before investing. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Stay updated on the latest developments, be prepared to adapt your strategies, and manage your risk accordingly. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Journey Continues PlanB’s controversial statement serves as a stark reminder that nothing is set in stone in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. While the falling ETH/BTC ratio and valid criticisms about centralization and pre-mine raise important questions, labeling Ethereum as “irrelevant” seems overly dismissive of its vast ecosystem, ongoing innovation, and potential for future growth. The debate highlights the fundamental tensions and diverse perspectives within the crypto market itself. Whether Ethereum can maintain its position and continue to evolve remains to be seen, but its journey is far from over. The crypto world will be watching closely.

According to cybersecurity researchers at ReversingLabs , the exploit works by hiding malicious code in seemingly legitimate npm software packages, which are pre-built bundles of code widely used by software developers. These malicious software packages target locally installed Atomic Wallet and Exodus Wallet files by installing a patch that overwrites the files to compromise the user interface and fool the unsuspecting victim into sending crypto to scam addresses. Software supply chain attacks are an emerging threat vector targeting crypto holders as the industry continues to play a cat-and-mouse game with hackers attempting to steal user funds using increasingly sophisticated methods to avoid detection.

The SafeWallet developer released a post-mortem update in March 2025 outlining a forensic analysis of the single biggest hack in crypto history. SafeWallet's analysis ultimately found that a Safe developer's computer was compromised by hackers who hijacked the developer's Amazon Web Services session tokens to access the firm's development environment and set up the Bybit attack. Jameson Lopp, a cypherpunk and chief security officer at Bitcoin ( BTC ) custody company Casa, recently sounded the alarm on BTC address poisoning attacks. A breakdown of the losses caused by crypto hacks and exploits in Q1 2025. Source: Hacken Address poisoning attacks target victims by generating destination addresses that match the first four and the last four characters of an address from the victim's transaction history. The threat actor then sends a transaction from the malicious address for a small amount, typically below one dollar, to the target so that the address will show up in a victim's transaction history. If the victim is not paying attention by carefully examining the entire address, they may mistakenly send funds to the malicious address, which closely resembles the destination. Cybersecurity firm Cyvers estimates that address poisoning attacks were responsible for $1.2 million in stolen funds in March 2025 alone.

Glassnode says that short-term holders – or those who acquired their coins in the past 155 days – may sell off if Bitcoin falls below $72,000 based on the realized price metric, sending the flagship crypto asset much lower. The realized price metric is the average price of Bitcoin in circulation calculated based on the price at which they were last moved. “Short-term holder realized price sits at $93,000, with ±1 sigma bands at $131,000 and $72,000. Price remains within this range, but has nearly tested the lower band. A break below the $72,000 threshold could challenge short-term conviction and trigger further downside.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode also says that key price levels identified using Bitcoin’s day moving averages (DMAs) indicate the flagship crypto asset is at risk of a downturn. “Bitcoin is now below both the 111 DMA ($93,000) and 200 DMA ($87,000), having recently tested 365 DMA at $76,000. These long-term moving averages have historically acted as key support zones. A breakdown here may signal a deeper structural shift in market sentiment.” Source: Glassnode/X Lastly, Glassnode says Bitcoin may dip to as low as $65,000, which may be seen as a buying opportunity by investors, based on the true market mean metric, a representative cost basis model for all coins acquired on secondary markets. Glassnode also uses the active realized price metric, which uses the realized price but excludes the supply that Glassnode determined is unlikely to return into circulation, to identify $71,000 as another possible support level to the downside. “BTC True Market Mean at $65,000 and the Active Realized Price at $71,000 mark deeper support levels. These levels sit above a low-liquidity zone, making them critical to defend. A drop into this range may catalyze high volatility and attract long-term buyers.” Source: Glassnode/X Bitcoin is trading for $78,888 at time of writing, up 1.8% in the last 24 hours.

The market capitalization of gold-backed tokens swelled to just under $2 billion on Wednesday, up 5.7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. The rise coincided with the yellow metal briefly touching a fresh all-time above $3,170/oz, TradingView shows. Alongside the price rally, gold tokens experienced a frenzy of activity and demand over the past weeks, fueled by the broader market turmoil. Weekly tokenized gold trading volume surpassed $1 billion, the highest since the U.S. banking turmoil of March 2023, according to a report by digital asset platform CEX.IO. The two largest tokens, Paxos Gold (PAXG), Tether Gold (XAUT), making up the bulk of the tokenized gold market, saw their weekly trading volumes surging over 900% and 300%, respectively, since January 20, according to the report citing CoinGecko data. PAXG also experienced continuous inflows totalling $63 million during this period, DefiLlama data shows. The rally tracks the broader gains in physical gold, which posted double-digit increases in 2025 amid geopolitical uncertainty and inflation concerns. However, even gold wasn’t spared during the market-wide sell-off triggered by U.S. tariffs, with prices briefly dropping 6% before quickly recovering to record highs. Since Trump’s inauguration, tokenized gold has been one of crypto’s top performing sectors, with its market cap up 21%, the report noted. By contrast, stablecoins gained a more modest 8% in market cap, while bitcoin declined 19% and the total crypto market lost 26%. “Tokenized gold is emerging as one of the key diversification strategies among crypto-native users, alongside bitcoin,"" wrote Alexandr Kerya, VP of product management at CEX.IO. ""It provides a safer and more stable approach to portfolio management, enabling users to stay within the crypto ecosystem while benefiting from the value and stability of the underlying physical asset.” ""At the same time, the broader RWA narrative helps make gold exposure more accessible and intuitive for users who may not have considered it before,"" Kerya added.

Massad served as the head of the CFTC from 2014 to 2017, and it was under his leadership that bitcoin was classified as a commodity. In recent years, Massad has shared his thoughts on what regulation around bitcoin and digital assets should look like. He’s appeared on Bloomberg to discuss the matter , and he recently testified at the first Senate Banking Subcommittee hearing on Digital Assets . Massad considers the need to balance user privacy when using public blockchains with the need for the U.S. government to monitor the networks for illicit activities as one the biggest challenges that regulators currently face — and he doesn’t claim to have the answer as to how this is best accomplished. He explained that it’s important that people cannot see the balance of our funds or the entirety of our transaction history when we do something as trivial as paying for a cup of coffee with a digital asset. In our conversation, he stated that the innovator who develops the technology that finds this balance will have found the “holy grail.” You can watch the interview here: This post Former CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad On Bitcoin And Digital Asset Privacy first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Frank Corva .",POLITICS|CFTC|MIT Bitcoin Expo|Privacy|Regulation|Regulators,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2025-04-10 18:11:22

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin , known for their past price surges, have experienced stagnation but are now drawing renewed attention after a modest market rebound. This article assesses whether SHIB and DOGE have the potential to stabilize and regain momentum in this uncertain climate. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Short-Term Recovery Amid Long-Term Decline SHIB ’s price rose by 3.74% in the past month while sliding 32.41% over the last six months. This indicates a modest recovery, though it remains overshadowed by a significant drop in the long term. The performance shows volatility, presenting opportunities for tactical moves despite the prevailing downward trend. Currently, Shiba Inu is trading in a range from $0.0000102 to $0.0000151 dollars. Bulls face resistance at $0.000018 and again at $0.0000226, while support exists near $0.0000081 and $0.00000325. A Relative Strength Index of 44.79 combined with negative momentum indicators suggests market indecision. Traders should watch for moves above resistance signaling a bullish shift or dips toward support for potential buying opportunities. Dogecoin's Steady Six-Month Surge Amid Short-Term Fluctuations Dogecoin posted a modest monthly gain of 1.55% and an impressive six-month jump of 41.73%, with a brief one-week drop of 3.62% highlighting short-term weakness. Price action showed clear recovery over the longer period despite temporary setbacks and regular fluctuations. Gains over six months suggest underlying strength while minor corrections remind traders of recent volatility. Price performance has been marked by periods of consolidation following intermittent dips. Current trading sees Dogecoin moving between a price range of $0.1258 and $0.2253. A resistance level appears at $0.2837 and support forms around $0.0847. Bears subtly influence the market, and the setup lacks a clear trend. Trading ideas include operating within these levels to catch incremental moves while staying cautious of short-term oscillation signals. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have strong support from their communities. Their previous successes show that rapid growth is possible. Market conditions play a key role in their recovery. Both coins have the potential to surge again, mirroring past achievements. Consistent development and active community engagement could boost their prospects. Many investors believe in their potential for another significant rise. Careful monitoring of market trends and updates is essential.

43180253,https://cryptonews.com/?p=350125,1744308889,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43180253.jpeg,UK Regulator Sounds Alarm on Stablecoin Risks Amid Crypto’s Growing Footprint,https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-issues-new-warning-over-stablecoin-market-risks/,"The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has issued a clear warning about the growing risks posed by the expanding use of the stablecoin and unbacked crypto assets. Source: bankofengland.co.uk During its meetings on April 4 and April 8, the Committee observed a notable rise in activity within the stablecoin and unbacked crypto markets over the past year. Stablecoin Risks Take Center Stage in FPC Discussions The FPC focused heavily on the quality and liquidity of reserves backing stablecoins, which are needed to support redemptions at par value, especially during market stress. Reserves that are poorly managed or difficult to liquidate could trigger fire sales, potentially destabilizing core financial markets—particularly if sterling-denominated stablecoins issued offshore continue to grow in popularity. The Committee also flagged the risk of currency substitution. In countries where foreign-denominated stablecoins gain traction, local currency use in both retail and wholesale markets could decline, weakening domestic monetary systems. The FPC also noted that stablecoins are increasingly used beyond crypto settlements, raising new risks for cross-border payments and off-chain settlements. While unbacked crypto assets have not yet caused systemic issues, their growing links to traditional finance require closer monitoring. To address these risks, the FPC emphasized the need for ongoing surveillance and stronger international coordination. The Committee backed the Financial Stability Board’s global framework for regulating both stablecoins and unbacked crypto assets. Conflicts of interest during the meetings were disclosed transparently. Members Jon Hall and Liz Oakes recused themselves due to professional affiliations. This discussion took place as UK regulators raised concerns about younger investors turning to crypto over more traditional investment vehicles. Some politicians have accused British regulators of creating a 'combative environment' that could drive crypto businesses away #UK #Crypto https://t.co/XzssQrJNS7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 28, 2025 FCA chief Nikhil Rathi noted that millions of under-35s in the UK have entered the financial market through crypto assets rather than stocks, a trend he sees as risky. The FCA has pushed for more savings to flow into long-term financial instruments like stocks and bonds, citing the UK’s lower rate of direct share ownership compared to countries such as the United States and Sweden. As of now, around 12% of British adults—roughly seven million people—have had some exposure to crypto. Stablecoin Regulation Amid Broader Financial Fragility Beyond the crypto space, the FPC discussed broader threats to financial stability in an environment shaped by heightened geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. A steep decline in risky assets, particularly those denominated in US dollars, and the effects of new US trade tariffs have contributed to a volatile backdrop. Global markets responded sharply after @POTUS announced a major escalation in his trade stance toward China. #Tariffs #Trump https://t.co/GDJxWUZDdg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 9, 2025 Despite the turbulence, market functioning remained resilient, supported by high trading volumes. However, the FPC warned that further corrections in equities and commodities remain likely. Fragmentation in global trade and finance adds another layer of risk. Reduced international cooperation, rising public debt, and the growing threat of cyberattacks all compound the challenges facing policymakers. Domestically, the FPC flagged vulnerabilities in market-based finance. In particular, increased leverage among hedge funds and a sharp rise in net gilt repo borrowing could worsen any market shock if large positions were unwound quickly. Private equity firms and highly leveraged corporates relying on market-based funding were also highlighted as potential weak points. If refinancing conditions tighten, these entities may come under intense financial pressure. Despite these concerns, UK households and most corporations have remained relatively resilient, thanks to low arrears and manageable debt-to-income ratios. These discussions reflect the FPC’s increased focus on crypto assets, particularly stablecoins, as part of its financial stability agenda.

Prosecutors Made a Statement,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-the-justice-departments-stop-cryptocurrency-operations-order-benefit-terra-luna-case-and-do-kwon-prosecutors-made-a-statement/,"A new Justice Department memo narrowing cryptocurrency enforcement priorities will not change the criminal case against Terraform Labs co-founder and former CEO Do Kwon, U.S. prosecutors confirmed. The internal DOJ memo, released Monday by Assistant Attorney General Todd Blanche, directed staff to halt prosecutions involving crypto exchanges, mixing services and offline wallets for actions taken by end users. It also recommended against pursuing criminal charges under securities or commodities laws unless alternative charges are available and litigation over a token’s legal status cannot be avoided. But at a hearing today before U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors said the guidelines had no impact on the current charges against Kwon. Kwon faces nine charges in total, including commodities and securities fraud, as well as wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud. Prosecutors told Judge Engelmayer they have “no plans” to modify or drop any of the charges at this time. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Has A Wave Of Listings This Evening - They Are Listing the Altcoin That Dropped By Half Today Kwon’s attorney, David Patton of Hecker Fink LLP, said the memo may not directly affect the charges but could be relevant in shaping upcoming pretrial motions. “I think that could potentially be the subject of some pretrial motions,” Patton said, particularly regarding the classification of the digital assets in question as securities. In a related civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a separate SDNY judge had previously ruled that the tokens in question were securities and found Kwon and Terraform Labs liable for fraud. Today, Judge Engelmayer instructed both parties to notify him in advance if they wish to invoke the findings in the SEC case during the criminal trial. The next set of pretrial motions is expected in July, while the third status conference is scheduled for June 12. Due to scheduling conflicts, Kwon's sentencing hearing was postponed from January 26, 2026, to February 17, 2026. *This is not investment advice.
