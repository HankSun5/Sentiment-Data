A swearing-in ceremony will soon put the former SEC commission in charge of the high-profile regulator — a matter cheered on by the digital assets sector that sees him as a strong ally after his significant background advising crypto firms as a financial-services consultant in Washington. Atkins' Senate confirmation was easily cleared on Wednesday in a 52-44 vote. The longtime figure in U.S. financial policy — both in government and as an outside adviser — was generally expected to easily move through confirmation, though the Senate Banking Committee approved Atkins along party lines , with all the panel's Democrats opposing the nominee. Atkins' confirmation took the usual months to emerge from the Senate, and in the time between the departure of predecessor Gary Gensler and Atkins' arrival, Trump's interim agency chief, Mark Uyeda, carried out an ambitious and rapidly deployed crypto overhaul. The SEC has thrown out almost all of its high-profile digital assets enforcement actions, and its staff quickly outlined a number of segments of the industry that it considers outside its jurisdiction — including some stablecoins, memecoins (such as the president's own $TRUMP) and proof-of-work mining. Many of the areas in which the agency has already demonstrated policy shifts overlap with Trump's family crypto businesses, including the family's memecoins and its ties to World Liberty Financial, which has pursued its own stablecoin. Atkins will be taking over those issues to apply permanent standards, potentially directed by future legislation that's now a priority in Congress. Atkins' tenure will begin with an incomplete commission, which is meant to have five members and whose sole Democrat — Caroline Crenshaw — is occupying an already expired term. The White House hasn't yet moved to fill the two Democratic positions on the commission.",Policy|Top Stories|Breaking News|Paul Atkins|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Senate,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-09 23:50:11
43144401,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147928,1744242627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking $1B US Fine Looms for TSMC in Huawei AI Chip Export Control Storm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-fine-tsmc-huawei-ai-chip/,"The tech world is buzzing with news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a giant in chip manufacturing, could be facing a monumental US fine . Reports suggest this penalty could reach a staggering $1 billion or more. The reason? A US export control investigation linked to a chip allegedly made by TSMC and used in a Huawei AI processor. This development, initially reported by Reuters, has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and technology sectors, raising questions about international trade and technological sovereignty. Why is the US considering a fine against TSMC? The core of the issue revolves around potential violations of US export control regulations. Let’s break down what we know: The Allegations : The investigation centers on a chip manufactured by TSMC that reportedly found its way into Huawei’s advanced Ascend 910B AI processor. The Players : Key entities involved are TSMC, Huawei, and Xiamen Sophgo Technologies (Sophgo), a Chinese chip designer affiliated with Bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain. The Timeline : This situation first surfaced in late 2024, with investigations unfolding into 2025. According to reports, the chip in question was designed by Sophgo and manufactured by TSMC. It’s then alleged that this Sophgo chip was incorporated into Huawei’s Ascend 910B AI chip . This multi-layered arrangement is crucial because Huawei’s processor is considered a cutting-edge piece of technology, especially for being produced in China. The estimated production runs into hundreds of thousands of units, amplifying the potential scale of the export control breach. TSMC, in response to these allegations, stated, “TSMC is a law-abiding company and we are committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” They further emphasized their proactive communication with the U.S. Commerce Department and commitment to compliance. Timeline of Events: Unpacking the TSMC-Huawei-Sophgo Situation To better understand the gravity of this potential US fine , let’s look at a timeline of key events: Date Event Significance October 2024 TechInsights, a Canadian research firm, disassembles Huawei’s 910B AI processor. Discovery of a TSMC-based chipset inside, resembling a Sophgo design, triggering initial concerns. November 2024 U.S. Department of Commerce orders TSMC to halt advanced chip shipments to Chinese customers, including Sophgo. Escalation of US scrutiny and direct impact on TSMC’s business with Chinese firms. December 2024 U.S. Commerce Department considers adding Sophgo to the U.S. blacklist. Increased pressure on Sophgo and further tightening of export controls. January 2025 U.S. adds over twenty Chinese companies, including Sophgo and Zhipu AI, to the blacklist. Formal blacklisting of Sophgo, restricting its access to US technology and markets. What’s at Stake for TSMC and the Chip Industry? The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is not just about the money. It carries significant implications: Financial Impact : A billion-dollar fine is substantial, even for a company as large as TSMC. It could impact their profitability and future investments. Reputational Damage : Allegations of export control violations can tarnish TSMC’s reputation as a trusted global chip manufacturer. Geopolitical Ramifications : This incident underscores the escalating tensions in the global technology race, particularly between the US and China. It highlights the complexities of supply chains and international regulations in the semiconductor industry. Industry-Wide Alert : This case serves as a stark reminder for all chip manufacturers about the stringent enforcement of export controls and the need for meticulous compliance. Huawei ‘s Role and the Tech Cold War Huawei , at the center of this controversy, has been a focal point of US-China tech tensions for years. The US government has repeatedly expressed concerns about Huawei’s technology and its potential national security implications. The alleged use of TSMC-manufactured chips in Huawei’s AI processor further intensifies this ongoing tech cold war. For Huawei , securing advanced AI chips is crucial for maintaining its competitiveness in the global market. Despite US sanctions, Huawei has shown resilience and continues to innovate. This situation underscores the immense pressure on Chinese tech companies to achieve self-sufficiency in critical technologies like semiconductors. Export Control Compliance: A New Era for Tech Companies? This unfolding situation with TSMC emphasizes the critical importance of export control compliance for tech companies operating globally. The regulations are complex and constantly evolving, requiring companies to be vigilant and proactive in their compliance efforts. Key takeaways for tech companies: Robust Compliance Programs : Companies need to invest in comprehensive export control compliance programs. Due Diligence : Thorough due diligence is essential to ensure adherence to all applicable regulations. Transparency and Communication : Open communication with regulatory authorities is crucial when potential issues arise. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for TSMC, Huawei, and US-China Tech Relations? The outcome of the US fine investigation into TSMC will be closely watched by the global tech industry. It will not only impact TSMC and Huawei but also set precedents for how export controls are enforced in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and semiconductor technology. As the investigation progresses, the industry braces for potential shifts in supply chains, compliance strategies, and the delicate balance of US-China tech relations. The potential $1 billion US fine against TSMC is a stark reminder of the high stakes in the global tech arena. It highlights the intricate web of international regulations, technological innovation, and geopolitical tensions that define the modern semiconductor industry. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech investors alike, this saga underscores the interconnectedness of global technology policy and market dynamics.

As of 8th of April 2025 , Solana trades at $107 , XRP at $1.75 , Ethereum at $1,520 , and MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.0002772 in its presale. While the first three leverage established ecosystems, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5.5 million presale raise and $5 target—a 71,329% ROI—could outshine them all by 2025 . Solana: A 500% Gain to $642? Solana, at $107 after a 10% dip in 7 days , is a favorite for its 4,000 transactions per second and $5 billion DeFi TVL across 1,000+ projects. Its 8,000% growth since 2021 shows promise. Coinpedia forecasts $1,000 by 2025 , an 834% gain, turning $100 into $934 . A 500% gain requires $642 , achievable by late 2025 , per X posts, if Solana’s NFT and gaming sectors grow. However, its $50 billion market cap (adjusted for $107 price) and competition from layer-1s like Aptos ( $2 billion TVL) may cap its upside in a bearish market. XRP: Targeting $10.50 for 500%? XRP, down 15% to $1.75 as of 7th of April 2025 , benefits from its SEC settlement on 25th of March 2025 , reducing a $125 million fine to $50 million . Its 1,500 transactions per second at 0.00001 XRP per transaction and 300+ financial partnerships drive adoption. Bitnation predicts $12 by 2026 , but some X posts see $10 by 2025 , a 471% gain, making $100 worth $571 . A 500% gain needs $10.50 , possible by 2025 if ETF approvals materialize, though its $118 billion market cap and RLUSD competition ( $170 million cap) pose challenges. Ethereum: 500% to $9,120 in Reach? Ethereum, at $1,520 after a 15% drop in 7 days , boasts a 619,116% historical ROI and $182 billion market cap (adjusted for $1,520 price). Its layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum ( $1.5 billion TVL) and 1,000+ dApps fuel growth. Analysts on X predict $10,000 by 2025 , a 558% gain, turning $100 into $658 . A 500% gain requires $9,120 , possible by 2025 , per Changelly, if tokenization and staking ( $100 billion locked) accelerate. Ethereum’s gas fees ( $2.50 average) and competition from Solana may slow its path to 500% in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Rising Star Analysts Predict Could Deliver 18,500% Returns 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised $5.5 million , with Phase 7 at 80% sold out as of 5th of April 2025 . Priced at $0.0002772 , its listing price of $0.007 offers a 2,500% ROI—already surpassing 500% . Analysts forecast $5 by 2025 , a 71,329% gain from listing. A $100 investment buys 360,750 tokens, worth $2,500 at listing and $1.8 million at $5 . A 500% gain is hit at just $0.00166 , a fraction of its target. With a 100% Hashex audit, DeFi lending at 20%+ yields, and 50,000 supporters growing by 12,000 weekly across 30+ countries, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s 1,570.6% presale rise from Stage 1 sets it apart. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Outshines the Pack Solana ( $642 ), XRP ( $10.50 ), and Ethereum ( $9,120 ) need 500% gains that their large market caps ( $50 billion , $118 billion , $182 billion ) make tough in 2025 . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $5 target and 71,329% potential—already 2,500% at listing—leverage a smaller cap. Its $5.5 million raise, against XRP’s $1.5 million weekly inflow, shows stronger retail faith. A $100 investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE hits $10K at $0.027 , a 100x , making 500% a mere milestone.

Last month, the DeFi project announced plans to launch a new stablecoin called USD1, which it says is pegged to the US dollar and backed by short-term government treasuries, dollar deposits and cash equivalents. Now, World Liberty wants to test its on-chain airdrop feature by distributing a small amount of USD1 to all current WLFI token holders. In a new proposal , the project says the final exact amount will be based “on total eligible wallets and budget.” Explains World Liberty, “Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1.” World Liberty notes in the fine print on its website that President Donald Trump is not an officer, director, founder, or employee of the firm or any of its affiliates, but the company does name the president as the “Chief Crypto Advocate.” World Liberty’s website also states that DT Marks DEFI LLC, an entity affiliated with Trump and some of his family members, holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens and is entitled to receive fees from the project.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy Flashes Warning,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sale-to-cover-debt-michael-saylors-strategy-flashes-warning/,"Strategy, the software company led by Michael Saylor, might need to sell some of its massive Bitcoin holdings to pay its bills. The company revealed this possibility in a regulatory filing on April 7, saying that without new financing, it could be forced to sell Bitcoin to cover financial obligations. Company Faces Billions In Potential Q1 Losses According to the filing, Strategy expects to report an unrealized loss of nearly $6 billion for the first quarter of 2025. This comes despite having a $1.7 billion tax benefit. The company currently holds over 528,000 B TC purchased at about $67,450 per coin, as Saylor posted on X on March 31. Their total investment amounts to more than $35 billion. Debt And Dividend Pressure Mounts The pressure on Strategy’s finances is growing. The company has roughly $8 billion in debt and must pay about $35 million in yearly interest payments. On top of that, it needs to distribute $150 million in annual dividends. $MSTR has acquired 22,048 BTC for ~$1.92 billion at ~$86,969 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 11.0% YTD 2025. As of 3/30/2025, @Strategy holds 528,185 $BTC acquired for ~$35.63 billion at ~$67,458 per bitcoin. $STRK $STRF https://t.co/1sfyBIglnt — Michael Saylor (@saylor) March 31, 2025 Reports suggest the company’s software business doesn’t make enough money to cover these costs. If Bitcoin prices drop, the company’s ability to manage its debt could be in trouble. New Funding Plan Announced To fix its cash problems , Strategy announced on March 10 plans to raise $2.1 billion by selling perpetual preferred stock with an 8% dividend. This move would help the company get money without taking on more traditional debt. The rumor has it that Strategy filed an 8-K form with the SEC on April 7, stating that if the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, the company may be forced to sell its Bitcoin holdings to repay debts. It was found that this statement is a standard risk disclosure practice, and it… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 9, 2025 The funds would support both company operations and, surprisingly, the purchase of even more Bitcoin. Based on reports from Wu Blockchain, warnings like these have appeared in past filings, suggesting this might be standard disclosure language rather than a new emergency. Bitcoin Price Trends And Expert Predictions Bitcoin trades at about $76,100 right now, which is down 8% over the past week. While this price is still above Strategy’s average purchase cost, market volatility puts the company in a risky position. Not everyone sees doom ahead, though. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said in an April 8 interview that Bitcoin could reach $110,000 or higher in the coming months. He believes central banks will soon cut interest rates, increasing global cash flow and helping Bitcoin’s price rise as a deflationary asset. The situation highlights how closely Strategy’s fate is now tied to BTC’s performance. While the company tries to secure more funding, its future depends largely on whether the cryptocurrency market moves up or down in the months ahead.

The ETF, trading under the ticker XXRP, achieved this milestone as cryptocurrency markets faced widespread selling pressure. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the performance “very respectable” given the current bearish market conditions. Related Reading: XRP Will Explode—And This Korean Expert Says He’ll Be ‘Laughing’ At Critics XRP Price Hits Five-Month Low As New ETF Launches According to market data, XRP’s price dropped to $1.61 on Monday, marking its lowest point in five months. The price briefly recovered to over $1.87 on Tuesday before falling again to $1.69 by evening. Even with these unstable price movements, Teucrium moved forward with its ETF launch, aiming to give investors a way to profit from price swings in either direction. $XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions. That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT). pic.twitter.com/u3QQq5yuHv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 8, 2025 New XRP ETF Outperforms Similar Solana Product Based on reports from Bloomberg’s Balchunas, the XXRP ETF’s first-day trading volume was about four times higher than what Solana’s similar 2x ETF saw on its launch day. This performance puts Teucrium’s product in the top 5% of all new ETF launches. However, the $5.43 million figure still pales in comparison to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF debut, which saw trading volume roughly 200 times larger. Community Shows Interest Despite Broad Market Losses The altcoin community has responded positively to the ETF launch, especially considering the harsh market conditions. Data shows that 137,000 traders faced liquidations in the 24 hours surrounding the launch, with total losses exceeding $413 million across cryptocurrency markets. Some XRP supporters have suggested that while XXRP’s volume was much smaller than BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), a potential spot ETF (which some have dubbed “IXRP”) could provide stronger competition. How The 2x XRP ETF Works And Its Risks Unlike spot ETFs that directly hold the underlying asset, Teucrium’s XXRP does not invest directly in XRP tokens. Instead, it’s designed to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP’s price movements, which amplifies both gains and losses for investors. Related Reading: XRP Dump? Not So Fast—Software Engineer Says Panic Selling Makes No Sense Community figure Crypto Eri warned about the ETF’s built-in risk factors, noting that even if XRP’s price stays flat, volatility alone could cause significant losses. For example, if XRP experiences 25% volatility, XXRP holders could see a 6% loss. With 70% volatility, those losses could balloon to 40%. The launch comes as more than 10 asset managers have filed applications with the SEC for spot XRP ETFs. Major firms like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications, though BlackRock has not yet expressed interest in launching an XRP-specific ETF product.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently addressed the Ways & Means Committee, making a statement that has reverberated across economic and political circles. According to reports from Walter Bloomberg X account, Greer indicated that President Donald Trump’s authority to impose tariffs is not without boundaries. This revelation sparks crucial questions about the future of US trade policy and the balance of power within the U.S. government. Let’s dive into the details of this pivotal announcement and explore its potential ramifications. What Did the Trade Representative Reveal About Trump’s Tariff Authority? Jamieson Greer’s appearance before the Ways & Means Committee was closely watched, especially given the Trump administration’s assertive approach to trade and tariffs. His statement, as reported, directly addresses the extent of presidential power in this domain. Here’s a breakdown of what we understand: Not Unlimited Power: The core message is clear – the President’s authority to apply tariffs is not absolute. This suggests there are checks and balances in place, even in matters of trade, which are often considered under executive purview. Congressional Oversight: Greer’s testimony before the Ways & Means Committee itself highlights the role of Congress in overseeing trade policy. The committee’s questioning and Greer’s responses underscore the legislative branch’s interest and influence in this area. Legal and Constitutional Framework: The notion of limited authority implies that tariff decisions are likely subject to a legal and constitutional framework. This could mean that certain tariff actions could be challenged or reviewed, ensuring they align with existing laws and trade agreements. This isn’t just about semantics; it’s about the very foundation of how US trade policy is formulated and implemented. It sets the stage for a potentially more nuanced and collaborative approach to international trade relations. Why is the Scope of Presidential Tariff Authority Under Scrutiny? The question of presidential tariff authority isn’t new, but it has gained prominence in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration. Several factors contribute to this increased scrutiny: Trump Administration’s Trade Actions: President Trump frequently utilized tariffs as a tool in trade negotiations and to address perceived trade imbalances. High-profile tariff disputes with countries like China and the European Union brought the issue of tariff authority to the forefront. Economic Impact of Tariffs: Tariffs can have significant economic consequences, affecting industries, consumers, and international relations. Concerns about these impacts naturally lead to questions about the process and authority behind tariff decisions. Separation of Powers: In the U.S. system of government, the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is fundamental. Debates about tariff authority often touch upon the balance of power between the President and Congress in matters of trade. Global Trade Norms: International trade is governed by a complex web of agreements and norms. Unilateral tariff actions can sometimes clash with these norms, raising questions about the consistency and predictability of US trade policy on the global stage. Therefore, Greer’s statement can be seen as part of a broader discussion about the appropriate limits of executive power in trade, especially in a globalized economy where trade policies have far-reaching effects. The Role of the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill Understanding the context of Jamieson Greer’s statement requires looking at the roles of both the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill . The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR): Key Trade Negotiator: The USTR is the primary entity responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and commodity policy. They lead negotiations with foreign governments and represent the U.S. at international trade organizations. Advisor to the President: The Trade Representative serves as the principal trade advisor to the President. Their views and statements carry significant weight in shaping the administration’s trade agenda. Congressional Interaction: While part of the executive branch, the USTR regularly interacts with Congress, particularly committees like the Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade matters. This interaction is crucial for policy alignment and oversight. Capitol Hill and the Ways & Means Committee: Legislative Oversight: Capitol Hill , as the seat of Congress, plays a vital role in legislative oversight of executive actions, including trade policy. Committees like the Ways & Means Committee are specifically tasked with reviewing and shaping trade-related legislation. Public Forum for Debate: Congressional hearings, such as the one where Greer testified, provide a public forum for discussing and debating important policy issues. They allow for transparency and accountability in government actions. Influence on Trade Laws: Congress has the power to enact laws that can shape and constrain presidential authority, including in the area of tariffs. The Ways & Means Committee’s engagement signals a potential legislative interest in clarifying or reinforcing the limits of Trump tariff authority or any presidential tariff authority in the future. The dialogue between the Trade Representative and Capitol Hill is thus a critical part of the checks and balances system, ensuring that trade policy is not solely determined by the executive branch. Implications for Future US Trade and Global Relations Greer’s statement about the limits of Trump tariff authority has several potential implications: More Predictable Trade Policy: If presidential tariff authority is perceived as constrained, it could lead to a more predictable and stable trade policy environment. This predictability is beneficial for businesses, investors, and international partners. Increased Congressional Role: Acknowledging limits on presidential authority could empower Congress to play a more active role in shaping trade policy. This might lead to more bipartisan and consensus-based approaches to trade. Potential for Reduced Trade Tensions: If the U.S. signals a move away from unilateral tariff actions, it could help reduce trade tensions with other countries. This could foster a more cooperative global trade environment. Legal Challenges to Tariffs: The recognition of limits might also open the door for legal challenges to tariffs that are seen as exceeding presidential authority. This could create a more judicial dimension to trade policy oversight. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges: Executive Branch Pushback: Future administrations might push back against perceived limitations on their tariff authority, potentially leading to further political and legal battles. Navigating Geopolitical Tensions: Trade is often intertwined with geopolitical considerations. Limits on tariff authority could constrain the U.S.’s ability to respond assertively to unfair trade practices or geopolitical challenges. Domestic Political Pressures: Domestic industries and political groups may lobby for tariff protections, and a perceived weakening of presidential tariff power could create domestic political tensions. Actionable Insights and Looking Ahead For businesses and stakeholders involved in international trade, Greer’s statement offers several key takeaways and actionable insights: Monitor Policy Developments: Closely track further statements and actions from both the USTR and Capitol Hill regarding trade policy and tariff authority. Policy shifts can significantly impact business strategies. Assess Risk and Opportunity: Evaluate how potential changes in US trade policy might affect your supply chains, markets, and competitive landscape. Identify both risks and opportunities arising from a potentially more constrained approach to tariffs. Engage in Policy Dialogue: Participate in industry associations and engage with policymakers to voice your perspectives on trade policy. Your input can help shape future trade regulations and agreements. Prepare for Legal and Regulatory Scrutiny: Be prepared for potential legal challenges to tariff actions and increased regulatory scrutiny of trade practices. Ensure compliance and seek legal counsel when needed. The unfolding narrative around Trump tariff authority and its limitations is a crucial development in the landscape of international trade. It signals a potential shift towards a more balanced and perhaps less unilateral approach to trade policy. For those operating in the global economic sphere, understanding these nuances is not just academic—it’s essential for strategic planning and navigating the complexities of the modern trade environment. Conclusion: A New Chapter in US Trade Policy? Jamieson Greer’s statement on Capitol Hill , highlighting the limits of presidential Trump tariff authority , marks a potentially pivotal moment for US trade policy . It underscores the enduring principles of checks and balances within the U.S. government and signals a possible recalibration of trade policy away from unilateral actions towards a more collaborative and predictable framework. While the full implications will unfold over time, this development warrants close attention from anyone invested in international trade, global economics, and the evolving dynamics of power in Washington D.C. The future trajectory of US trade policy may well be shaped by this crucial acknowledgement of limitations.

BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price sunk to its lowest level in five months, dropping over 10% from last week. BTC is down ~19% year to date and ~28% below its record high from January 2025. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price plummeted to a two-year low, falling nearly 23% from last week. ETH is down ~56% year to date and is ~69% below its record high from November 2021. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and the during the first month of 2025, however, it has since pulled back to levels last seen in November. XRP's is down ~23% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

43145018,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147930,1744243813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Shift: Tariff Wars Ignite Crypto Payment Adoption, VanEck Reveals",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tariff-wars-crypto-payment-adoption/,"Are you prepared for a seismic shift in global finance? The escalating trade tensions led by the U.S. are not just reshaping international commerce; they’re inadvertently fueling a surge in crypto payment adoption . VanEck, a well-regarded investment management firm, has released a compelling report highlighting this unexpected consequence of tariff wars. Let’s dive into how these global economic pressures are pushing nations and businesses towards cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Why Tariff Tensions Are a Catalyst for Crypto Payment Adoption? The core of the issue lies in the disruption of traditional financial systems. When countries impose tariffs and engage in trade disputes, the stability of fiat currencies can be called into question. VanEck’s report suggests that this instability, coupled with a desire to circumvent traditional financial rails, is making crypto payment adoption increasingly attractive. Think of it as a financial detour around roadblocks erected by trade wars. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors at play: Dollar Weakness: Continued uncertainty and trade imbalances can lead to a weakening U.S. dollar, the world’s reserve currency. This makes alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, more appealing as stores of value and mediums of exchange. Geopolitical Fragmentation: As global alliances shift and trade blocs realign, countries are seeking financial independence. Cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized, borderless solution that sidesteps traditional geopolitical constraints. Sanctions and Restrictions: Tariff wars often go hand-in-hand with sanctions. Cryptocurrencies can provide a route for nations and entities to conduct transactions outside the reach of these restrictions. Desire for Alternatives: Businesses and individuals caught in the crossfire of trade disputes may actively seek alternative payment systems to mitigate risks and ensure smooth transactions. Bitcoin : The Unexpected Beneficiary? While the cryptocurrency landscape is vast, Bitcoin is emerging as a primary beneficiary of this trend. Its established network, decentralized nature, and increasing acceptance as a store of value position it uniquely in this evolving scenario. VanEck’s report highlights specific instances where Bitcoin is gaining traction due to tariff-related pressures. Examples from the Report: China and Russia Energy Deals: Watcher Guru’s report on X indicates that China and Russia are reportedly utilizing cryptocurrencies for some energy transactions. This could be a strategic move to bypass dollar-denominated systems and mitigate the impact of potential tariffs or sanctions on energy trade. Emerging BTC Mining Hubs: Countries like Bolivia, France, and Germany are reportedly exploring Bitcoin mining and energy strategies. This suggests a proactive approach to leveraging Bitcoin, potentially as a means to attract investment, diversify energy resources, and position themselves in the burgeoning crypto economy. What Are the Potential Benefits of Crypto Payments in a Tariff-Driven World? The rise of crypto payment adoption , spurred by tariff tensions, presents several potential advantages: Reduced Transaction Costs: Cross-border transactions using traditional banking systems can be expensive and time-consuming. Cryptocurrencies can offer significantly lower fees and faster settlement times. Increased Efficiency: Crypto transactions are often processed more quickly than traditional bank transfers, streamlining international trade and payments. Greater Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide access to financial services for individuals and businesses in regions with limited banking infrastructure, fostering greater global economic participation. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies, offers enhanced security and transparency in transactions, reducing the risk of fraud and corruption. Are There Challenges to Overcome for Widespread Crypto Payment Adoption? Despite the promising outlook, widespread crypto payment adoption in international trade faces certain hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Lack of clear and consistent regulations can hinder widespread adoption by businesses and institutions. Volatility Concerns: Cryptocurrency prices can be volatile, which can be a concern for businesses engaged in international trade. However, stablecoins and other mechanisms are emerging to mitigate this volatility. Scalability Issues: Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin in its early days, have faced scalability challenges in processing a large volume of transactions. However, technological advancements are addressing these issues. Education and Awareness: Widespread adoption requires greater education and awareness about cryptocurrencies and their benefits among businesses and consumers. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Financial Landscape For businesses and individuals looking to navigate this evolving financial landscape, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in both global trade and the cryptocurrency space. Follow reports from institutions like VanEck and stay updated on regulatory changes. Explore Crypto Payment Solutions: Businesses involved in international trade should explore integrating cryptocurrency payment solutions to potentially reduce costs, increase efficiency, and mitigate risks associated with traditional financial systems. Consider Bitcoin as a Hedge: In an environment of dollar weakness and geopolitical uncertainty, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Educate Yourself: Invest time in understanding the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This knowledge will be crucial for making informed decisions in the future. Conclusion: Embracing the Inevitable Shift? VanEck’s report paints a compelling picture of how tariff tensions are acting as an unexpected catalyst for crypto payment adoption . While challenges remain, the potential benefits – from reduced transaction costs to greater financial independence – are undeniable. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as alternative settlement tools and hedges against uncertainty is likely to become increasingly significant.

This development is significant as Atkins has promised to provide regulatory clarity for the industry, which was lacking under past Chair Gary Gensler’s administration. US Senate Confirms Paul Atkins As SEC Chair In an X post , Journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed that the US Senate has confirmed Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. The Upper Chamber voted 52 to 44 in favor of Atkins’ nomination for the SEC role. Pro-Bitcoin and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis also confirmed this development, sharing her excitement about Atkin’s confirmation as the SEC Chair. The Senator revealed her discussion with him about digital asset legislation and affirmed that she is confident that his leadership will bring positive change. As CoinGape reported, Paul Atkins had promised during his nomination hearing to prioritize providing regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. The incoming SEC Chair also promised to repair the Commission’s image following Gensler’s infamous regulation-by-enforcement approach. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of the top crypto exchange , Coinbase, also congratulated Atkins on his confirmation. He stated that more progress is “sorely needed” after four years of regress. One Final Step Before The Swearing In Terrett revealed that the US Senate will send Paul Atkins’ confirmation to the White House, where US President Donald Trump will sign off on it. Once that happens, the president will swear him in as the next US SEC Chair. However, it remains unclear when exactly this will happen. In the meantime, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda would continue at the helm of affairs. The Commission has planned a roundtable for April 11, which would focus on crypto trading. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce remarked that hearing the public’s concerns and suggestions helps the Commission “create a clear, sensible, and fair path forward for the crypto industry.” The post US Senate Confirms Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins As SEC Chair appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Regulation News|paul atkins|US SEC|US SEC Chair,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-10 00:12:53

The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF would seek to track the price of the memecoin Dogecoin ( DOGE ), according to the firm’s April 9 Form S-1 registration statement. The Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, plans to assist 21Shares with marketing the fund. 21Shares said Coinbase Custody would be the proposed custodian of its Dogecoin ETF but did not specify a fee, ticker or what stock exchange it would list on. Source: James Seyffart 21Shares must also file a 19b-4 filing with the SEC to kickstart the regulator's approval process for the fund. DOGE currently has a $24.2 billion market cap and is the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by value. It was created in 2013 as a joke and is a fork of Lucky Coin, which itself is a fork of Bitcoin. 21Shares’ proposed Dogecoin ETF is the company’s latest effort to expand its spot crypto ETF offerings, which currently includes only a spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) fund. The issuer also filed with the SEC in February to launch a spot Polkadot ( DOT ) ETF and last year, it filed to create a spot XRP ( XRP ) ETF. Related: Dogecoin millionaires are buying dips as DOGE price eyes 30% rally The recent surge in crypto ETF filings reflects a “spaghetti cannon approach” from issuers testing which products the new SEC leadership might approve, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in February. “Issuers will try to launch many many different things and see what sticks,” Seyffart said. Seyffart and fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in February that there is a 75% chance that the SEC will approve a spot Dogecoin ETF this year, while the betting platform Polymarket currently gives approval odds of 64%. 21Shares and House of Doge partner for DOGE funds in Switzerland 21Shares also said on April 9 that it partnered with House of Doge to launch a fully backed Dogecoin exchange-traded product on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange. The 21Shares Dogecoin product will trade under the ticker “DOGE” with a 2.5% fee. 21Shares president Duncan Moir said that Dogecoin “has become more than a cryptocurrency: it represents a cultural and financial movement that continues to drive mainstream adoption, and DOGE offers investors a regulated avenue to be part of this exciting project.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-10 00:16:44

A top White House official is boldly proclaiming that a golden age for digital assets could be unleashed under a Trump administration. Bo Hines, chairman of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, has ignited excitement in the crypto community with his recent statements. Could this be the dawn of a new era for crypto in the United States? Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of digital currencies. Is Trump the Crypto President Ushering in a Golden Age? Bo Hines didn’t mince words when he took to X (formerly Twitter) to declare President Donald Trump as the true crypto president . This isn’t just political rhetoric; it’s a signal of a potentially dramatic change in approach towards digital assets in the US. Hines argues that under Trump’s leadership, the United States is poised to enter a ‘golden age’ for crypto and other groundbreaking financial technologies. This statement is a stark contrast to the current regulatory environment and hints at a future where innovation in the digital asset space might be not just tolerated, but actively encouraged. Here’s a breakdown of Hines’ key points: Trump as the ‘Crypto President’: Hines positions Trump as a champion for the crypto industry, suggesting a deep understanding and support for its growth. Golden Age Promise: The claim of a ‘golden age’ implies a period of significant growth, innovation, and perhaps less restrictive regulation for the crypto sector. Critique of Biden Administration: Hines alleges that crypto companies have been unfairly targeted by a ‘weaponized judicial system’ under the current administration, suggesting a hostile regulatory environment. What Does a Crypto Golden Age Actually Mean for Digital Assets? The term ‘ golden age ‘ is certainly attention-grabbing, but what could it realistically entail for the world of digital assets ? For crypto enthusiasts and businesses, this phrase conjures up images of reduced regulatory burdens, clearer legal frameworks, and a government that fosters rather than hinders innovation. Let’s consider some potential benefits: Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: A golden age could mean a move away from what many in the industry perceive as regulation by enforcement. Clearer rules and guidelines could attract more investment and encourage growth. Innovation Hub: With a more supportive stance, the US could become a global hub for crypto innovation, attracting talent and businesses from around the world. Economic Growth: A thriving crypto sector can create jobs, spur technological advancements, and contribute significantly to the economy. Mainstream Adoption: Less hostile policies could pave the way for wider mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology across various sectors. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that a ‘golden age’ isn’t just about deregulation. It also necessitates responsible growth, consumer protection, and addressing legitimate concerns around illicit activities. The challenge lies in finding the right balance. Navigating Crypto Regulation: A Trump vs. Biden Comparison The current narrative from Hines paints a picture of stark contrast between potential crypto regulation under Trump and the existing policies under Biden. While the Biden administration has focused on investor protection and combating illicit finance in the crypto space, leading to increased scrutiny and enforcement actions, the Trump camp seems to be signaling a more industry-friendly approach. Here’s a simplified comparison: Aspect Biden Administration (Perceived) Potential Trump Administration (Projected) Regulatory Focus Investor protection, combating illicit finance, increased scrutiny Innovation, economic growth, potentially lighter regulatory touch Industry Perception Seen as restrictive and sometimes hostile Potentially more supportive and encouraging Enforcement Actions Increased, with focus on compliance and alleged violations Potentially reduced, with focus on fostering growth Overall Tone Cautious, emphasizing risks Optimistic, emphasizing opportunities It’s important to note that these are perceptions and projections based on current statements and trends. Actual policies and outcomes can be complex and influenced by various factors. The Future of US Crypto Policy: What to Expect? Looking ahead, the direction of US crypto policy remains a critical question for the global digital asset market. Hines’ statements suggest a significant potential shift if Trump were to regain the presidency. This could have far-reaching implications not only for the US crypto industry but also for the global landscape, influencing how other countries approach digital asset regulation. Key questions to consider: Will Regulation Ease? Could we see a rollback of some current regulations or a shift towards a more permissive regulatory framework? Innovation Boom? Would a Trump administration actively promote crypto innovation through policy and incentives? Global Impact? How would a US ‘golden age’ for crypto affect international crypto markets and regulatory trends? Balancing Innovation and Protection? Can a Trump administration strike the right balance between fostering growth and ensuring consumer protection and financial stability? The answers to these questions will unfold over time, but one thing is clear: the conversation around crypto policy in the US is heating up, and the potential for significant change is palpable. The prospect of a ‘golden age’ under a Trump presidency is a powerful narrative that has undoubtedly captured the attention of the crypto world. Conclusion: A New Dawn or Just a Promise? Bo Hines’ bold pronouncements have injected a surge of optimism into the crypto community. The idea of a ‘golden age’ for digital assets under a Trump administration is certainly compelling for those who feel stifled by current regulations. Whether this vision becomes reality remains to be seen. However, it’s undeniable that the political winds are shifting, and the future of crypto in the United States could be on the cusp of a significant transformation. Keep a close watch on developments in US crypto policy – the next chapter could be truly groundbreaking.

A new report from CryptoQuant, shared via X, paints a compelling picture of Binance’s growing dominance in the spot trading arena, leaving competitors in its wake. Let’s dive into the numbers and analyze what this powerful trend means for the crypto landscape. Binance Spot Trading Volume: A Deep Dive into Dominance The numbers don’t lie. According to CryptoQuant’s analysis, the overall spot trading volume for Bitcoin and altcoins has seen a significant decrease since February 3rd. Spot Bitcoin trading volume plummeted from a robust $44 billion to a more modest $10 billion. Similarly, altcoin spot trading volume experienced a sharp decline, shrinking from $122 billion to $23 billion. This market-wide contraction makes Binance’s performance even more noteworthy. Here’s where Binance’s crypto exchange dominance truly shines: Bitcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s share of the Bitcoin spot trading volume reached an impressive 49% during this period of market decline. Nearly half of all spot Bitcoin trades are happening on Binance. Altcoin Spot Trading: Binance’s grip on altcoin trading is even stronger. The exchange commands a staggering 64% of the total altcoin spot trading volume. That’s almost two-thirds of the entire market! Competitor Contraction: While Binance’s share has surged, the volume accounted for by its competitors has noticeably decreased. This indicates a clear shift in market share towards Binance. Why is Binance Solidifying its Spot Trading Lead? What factors are contributing to Binance’s growing market share in spot trading? Several elements likely play a crucial role: Liquidity: Binance is renowned for its deep liquidity. Traders flock to exchanges where they can execute large orders quickly and efficiently without significantly impacting prices. High liquidity attracts more volume, creating a positive feedback loop. Variety of Trading Pairs: Binance offers an extensive selection of trading pairs, including a vast array of altcoins. This caters to a wide range of traders with diverse investment strategies. User Experience: Binance’s platform is generally considered user-friendly, with a robust trading interface, comprehensive charting tools, and mobile accessibility. A seamless user experience can be a significant draw for both novice and experienced traders. Global Reach: Binance operates globally, serving users in numerous countries. This broad reach expands its potential user base and trading volume. Reputation and Trust: Despite facing regulatory challenges in some jurisdictions, Binance has built a strong brand reputation and a degree of trust within the crypto community, particularly for its trading capabilities. Bitcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Near Half-Share The fact that Binance captures nearly half of the Bitcoin trading volume is a testament to its strength in the flagship cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin remains the most traded cryptocurrency, and Binance’s dominance here underscores its position as a primary venue for Bitcoin transactions. This substantial Bitcoin volume contributes significantly to Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Altcoin Trading Volume: Binance’s Commanding Two-Thirds Binance’s control over altcoin trading volume is even more pronounced, reaching almost two-thirds of the market. Altcoins, with their higher volatility and diverse narratives, often attract speculative trading interest. Binance’s extensive altcoin listings and deep liquidity in these pairs make it the go-to platform for altcoin traders. This dominance in the altcoin space further solidifies Binance’s overall spot trading leadership. Is Binance’s Dominance a Threat or a Benefit to the Crypto Market? The question arises: is Binance’s increasing crypto exchange dominance a positive or negative development for the broader cryptocurrency market? Potential Benefits: Increased Liquidity: Binance’s dominance can concentrate liquidity, potentially leading to tighter spreads and more efficient trading conditions for users on its platform. Platform Stability and Innovation: As a leading exchange, Binance has the resources to invest in platform stability, security, and innovation, potentially benefiting the entire ecosystem. Potential Challenges: Centralization Risks: Concentrated market share in one exchange raises concerns about centralization. If Binance were to face significant issues (regulatory, technical, or security-related), it could have a disproportionate impact on the market. Reduced Competition: Excessive dominance could stifle competition among exchanges, potentially leading to fewer choices and less innovation in the long run. Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance’s size and influence attract increased regulatory attention, which could lead to compliance burdens and operational challenges. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders For crypto traders, Binance’s spot trading dominance has several implications: Liquidity Access: Binance remains a prime destination for accessing deep liquidity, especially for Bitcoin and a wide range of altcoins. Price Discovery: Prices on Binance can be highly influential in the broader market due to its significant trading volume. Traders should monitor Binance’s price action closely. Diversification Considerations: While Binance offers advantages, traders should also consider diversifying their exchange usage to mitigate risks associated with relying heavily on a single platform. Conclusion: Binance’s Reign in Spot Trading Binance’s deepening dominance in spot trading is undeniable. As Binance spot trading volume continues to outpace competitors, the exchange is solidifying its position as a central hub in the cryptocurrency market. While this dominance brings both potential benefits and challenges, it’s a trend that demands close attention from traders, regulators, and the crypto industry as a whole. The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and Binance’s ability to maintain and expand its lead will be a key factor shaping the future of crypto trading.

In a closely watched vote, the Senate has moved to advance Paul Atkins’ nomination to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development, confirmed by Crypto In America host Eleanor Terrett on X, signals a potential shift in how digital assets will be governed in the United States. With a final confirmation vote potentially on the horizon, the crypto community is keenly observing what this could mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation. Why is Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination a Hot Topic in Cryptocurrency Regulation? Paul Atkins is not a new face in the realm of financial regulation. Having previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, Atkins brings a wealth of experience to the table. His nomination is particularly noteworthy for the cryptocurrency industry, a sector that has been navigating a complex and often unclear regulatory environment. But why is this nomination generating so much buzz, and what could it mean for the future of digital assets? Here’s a breakdown of why Atkins’ nomination is significant: Experience Matters: Atkins’ prior tenure at the SEC provides him with deep insights into the workings of the commission and the intricacies of securities law. This experience could translate into a more informed and nuanced approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Potential Policy Shift: Depending on Atkins’ stance on digital assets (which we will delve into further), his confirmation could signal a shift in the SEC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. This could range from stricter enforcement to a more accommodating framework. Market Impact: Regulatory clarity is crucial for the growth and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Atkins’ presence on the SEC could influence the direction of regulations, impacting investor sentiment, market innovation, and the overall trajectory of the digital asset space. Investor Protection: A key mandate of the SEC is investor protection. Atkins’ views and policies will likely play a role in how the SEC aims to protect investors in the often-volatile cryptocurrency market. Decoding the Senate Vote: What Does 51-45 Mean for the SEC Nomination? The Senate vote of 51-45 to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC nomination is a procedural step, but a crucial one. It indicates that there is enough support in the Senate to move forward with the nomination process. However, the relatively close margin also suggests that there is some level of opposition or at least reservations regarding his appointment. Let’s break down what this vote signifies: Vote Outcome Implication 51-45 Advance Vote Indicates sufficient support to proceed with the nomination. A final confirmation vote is likely to follow. Close Margin Suggests potential opposition or debate surrounding the nomination. The final vote may also be closely contested. Possible Confirmation Vote Soon As indicated by Eleanor Terrett, a final confirmation vote could happen quickly, possibly even on the same day or in the immediate future. The narrow margin underscores the politically charged environment surrounding financial regulation and potentially differing views on the approach to cryptocurrency oversight within the Senate. Paul Atkins and Cryptocurrency: What are His Stances? To understand the potential impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on cryptocurrency regulation, it’s essential to examine his past statements and positions on digital assets. While direct quotes specifically addressing cryptocurrency might be less readily available from his time as SEC Commissioner (given the nascent stage of crypto then), we can infer potential approaches based on his broader regulatory philosophy and statements on related topics. Here’s what we can glean: Free Market Principles: Atkins is generally considered to be a proponent of free markets and limited government intervention. This perspective could suggest a potentially less heavy-handed regulatory approach to cryptocurrency, favoring innovation and market-driven solutions. Rule of Law and Clarity: A consistent theme in Atkins’ public statements has been the importance of clear rules and regulations. For the cryptocurrency space, which often grapples with regulatory ambiguity, this could be a positive sign. Clear guidelines could foster compliance and encourage institutional investment. Investor Protection Focus: While advocating for less burdensome regulation, Atkins, like all SEC Commissioners, is bound by the mandate to protect investors. His approach might involve focusing on disclosure and anti-fraud measures rather than overly restrictive rules that stifle innovation. Technology Neutrality: A potential approach consistent with free market principles is technology neutrality. This would mean applying existing securities laws to cryptocurrencies based on their characteristics and functions, rather than creating entirely new and separate regulatory frameworks just for digital assets. It’s important to note that these are inferences. The actual policies and positions Atkins might take as an SEC Commissioner in 2024, especially concerning the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, will need to be observed after his potential confirmation. Impact on the Crypto Market: Navigating the New Regulatory Horizon The immediate and long-term impact of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination on the cryptocurrency market is a subject of intense speculation and analysis. While predicting the future is impossible, we can consider potential scenarios and factors that will shape the market’s response. Potential Positive Impacts: Regulatory Clarity: If Atkins champions clearer regulatory guidelines, this could reduce uncertainty in the market, encouraging institutional investment and broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Innovation-Friendly Environment: A less restrictive regulatory approach could foster innovation within the crypto space, allowing new projects and technologies to flourish in the US. Market Maturity: Clear and sensible regulations can contribute to the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, making it more stable and attracting a wider range of participants. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Enforcement Actions: Even with a potentially less interventionist approach, the SEC will still be responsible for enforcing securities laws in the crypto space. Companies must remain vigilant about compliance. Global Regulatory Landscape: US regulations are just one piece of the puzzle. The cryptocurrency market is global, and international regulatory coordination will be crucial for long-term stability and growth. Evolving Technology: The pace of innovation in cryptocurrency is rapid. Regulations need to be adaptable to keep up with technological advancements without stifling progress. What’s Next After the Senate Advances the SEC Nomination? Following the Senate’s move to advance Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination, the next steps are crucial and could unfold rapidly. Here’s a likely timeline and what to watch for: Final Confirmation Vote: As reported, a final confirmation vote could take place very soon. This vote will determine whether Atkins is officially confirmed as an SEC Commissioner. Senate Debate (Possible): Even after the advance vote, there could be further debate on the Senate floor before the final vote. This debate could offer more insights into senators’ views on Atkins and cryptocurrency regulation. SEC Commissioner Role: If confirmed, Atkins will assume his role as an SEC Commissioner. The immediate impact will depend on the existing agenda of the SEC and how quickly Atkins can influence policy. Policy Announcements and Actions: Over time, we can expect to see policy announcements, enforcement actions, and regulatory guidance emerging from the SEC that reflect the perspectives of the commissioners, including Atkins. For those in the cryptocurrency industry and investors, staying informed about these developments is paramount. Monitoring SEC announcements, statements from commissioners, and expert analysis will be key to navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Cryptocurrency and Regulation The Senate’s advancement of Paul Atkins’ SEC Nomination marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. While the final outcome and long-term impacts are still unfolding, this development signals a potential shift in the regulatory winds. For the cryptocurrency community, this is a time to pay close attention, engage in informed discussions, and prepare for the evolving regulatory horizon. Whether this nomination leads to a more innovation-friendly or a more stringent regulatory environment remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: cryptocurrency regulation is entering a new and crucial chapter.

Last around $0.63, the Cardano price is up a stunning 23% from its Monday lows around $0.50. The US President announced a 90-day pause on the implementation of new tariffs on some countries on Wednesday. Good news!

And Trump backing off from at least some of his tariff threats was just the catalyst traders needed to close out some shorts, and for dip buyers to flood back into the market. Could this be the start of a new Cardano price rally back to its December highs in the $1.30 area? Where Next for the Cardano Price – Back to All-time Highs? The impressive Wednesday rally has some traders asking if the Cardano price might now have bottomed, and a return to late-2024 highs might be on the cards. Well, an easing of trade war concerns and the fact that the market got so bearish and oversold earlier this week suggest that a local low is likely in. A choppy continued recovery could well extend in the coming days, assuming no new trade war escalation headlines rock sentiment once again. Of course, that’s no guarantee, as the trade war between the US and China continues to heat up, even if things are cooling off with other nations. Macro could also throw spanners in the works. Still too hot inflation, which could rise further as tariff affects creep through, and a robust labor market are preventing the Fed from being able to ease to support falling markets and a slower economy.

Gonna be… pic.twitter.com/LHfUqwf52y — World War Bitcoin (@WWBitcoin) April 9, 2025 With money markets currently pricing 100bps of easing by the year’s end, per the CME’s Fed Watch Tool , there is a risk that hot inflation data disappoints the market and risk appetite is hurt. And US treasury markets continue to send disturbing signals, with the US 10-year yield having jumped 45bps from earlier weekly lows to around 4.30% as of early Thursday overnight trade. With US long-dated yields still well above 4.0%, investors will be disappointed by the lack of downside in US bond yields despite the meaningful correction in US stock markets in recent weeks. All said, it remains a complicated backdrop for risk assets. Investors, retail or institutional, are unlikely to feel confident enough to pile back into crypto’s like Cardano anytime soon. Cardano Back to $0.30? Bearish technicals and a lack of any notable Cardano specific narratives further increase the risk of further price downside in the near-future. Cardano has seen a decent bounce from recent weekly lows, but remains in an overall downtrend, and remains substantially below all of its major moving averages. Meanwhile, all of the hype that Cardano would somehow be one of the major beneficiaries of the arrival of a pro-crypto Trump administration hasn’t come to anything yet. Cardano hasn’t been selected as the blockchain to run Treasury payments on top of. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson didn’t make it into Trump’s inner circle of crypto advisors. Yet the Cardano price still remains around 2x above its pre-Trump election victory levels. A worsening backdrop in the months ahead coupled with a continued deflation of retail hype, suggests the Cardano price could continue to ebb lower back to its mid-2024 range in the $0.20s-40s. One theme to watch: Ripple and Cardano appear to be cooking up some sort of collaboration. It remains to be seen whether this will yield any bullish results for either crypto.

The pullback has deepened over the past two months, with Bitcoin trading between $75,000 and $79,000 in April. The bullish prospect is becoming very weak, and the crypto sector is searching for technical clarity amidst a buildup of pressure across traditional markets, especially with equities. Given the situation, crypto analyst Tony Severino noted that the current setup offers one major move that could invalidate an extended bearish momentum. Tony “The Bull” Identifies Important LMACD Inflection Point To Reject Bearish Hypothesis According to Tony “The Bull” Severino, the most important chart development is the incoming bearish crossover on Bitcoin’s 1-month LMACD indicator. The LMACD, which tracks market momentum on a logarithmic scale, currently shows the blue line drifting toward a crossover beneath the orange signal line. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Reveals Why The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over With Crash Below $80,000 This kind of intending crossover is known to be an important bearish confirmation, and its appearance has coincided with growing weakness across broader markets, including traditional indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Although the crossover has not yet been confirmed by a monthly close, its presence at the open of April is enough to stir concern. Severino explained that unless a significant rally occurs before the end of the month, the blue line will cross below the orange line, and momentum will officially turn bearish. If the month closes with the crossover intact, it will mark the first confirmed bearish momentum shift on the LMACD since the bullish reversal in July 2023. Bitcoin Bulls Still Have A Window To Flip The Outlook Before April Ends According to Tony Severino, this crossover is not the sole reason for leaning bearish on Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory, but it stands out as the most precise technical marker that could trigger a rethink. The crossover isn’t isolated to the Bitcoin price chart. Severino highlighted that the same bearish crossover was already confirmed last month in major indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. Interestingly, the crossover has already shown up in the BTCUSD versus GOLD chart, further supporting the idea that Bitcoin is no longer moving in isolation but reacting to widespread macro pressures. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price 1-Month Stochastic: Expert Warns Investors To Stop Comparing BTC To 2017 Moves Despite the bearish tilt, the situation is not yet final. The current crossover is provisional, meaning there’s still time for bulls to reverse the signal. A powerful upward move this month could cause the blue LMACD line to diverge higher, reestablish upward momentum and invalidate the bearish setup before it solidifies. The analyst also noted this possibility of a rebound considering the current oversold levels. This is because oversold technical conditions generally creates the kind of environment where a dramatic reversal is possible. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $77,260, down by 2.23% and 8.93% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

43146648,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147966,1744246853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark Progress: US Legislators Advance Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-regulation-legislative-progress/,"Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States! If you’re invested in digital assets or closely following the crypto space, you’ll want to pay close attention to the recent strides made by U.S. legislators. The buzz is all about the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, which has been actively working on shaping the future of crypto regulation . Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for you. What’s the Latest on US Crypto Legislation? The House Financial Services Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee recently convened a hearing that’s generating significant optimism. The core purpose? To openly discuss and refine proposed legislation concerning cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just talk; it’s about laying the groundwork for clear and effective rules for the digital asset market. According to reports from CoinDesk, key figures are expressing confidence in the progress being made. Here’s a quick rundown of the key highlights from the hearing: Bipartisan Effort: The discussions are happening across party lines, suggesting a growing consensus on the need for US crypto legislation . Focus on Clarity: The aim is to create a regulatory framework that provides clarity for businesses and investors in the crypto space. Stakeholder Engagement: Lawmakers are actively collaborating with various stakeholders to ensure the legislation is robust and practical. Stablecoin Bill: A Priority for the Trump Administration? One of the most talked-about pieces of potential US crypto legislation is the stablecoin bill. Why is this significant? Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value (often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar), are crucial for facilitating transactions within the crypto ecosystem. Chairman Bryan Steil of the House Financial Services Committee Digital Assets Subcommittee revealed some interesting insights during the hearing: Top Priority: Steil indicated that the stablecoin bill is a high priority, potentially even one of the initial goals for the Trump administration. This suggests strong political will behind moving this legislation forward. Smooth Progress: He described the progress on the stablecoin bill as “smooth,” implying that legislative hurdles are being overcome effectively. This is encouraging news for those seeking regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Market Structure Legislation: Strengthening the Crypto Framework Beyond stablecoins, the broader market structure legislation is another critical area of focus. This legislation aims to establish a comprehensive framework for how the crypto market operates, covering aspects like exchanges, custody, and trading. Chairman French Hill of the House Financial Services Committee emphasized the collaborative approach being taken: Refinement and Strengthening: Chairman Hill stated that the committee is actively working with various stakeholders to “refine and strengthen” the market structure legislation. This indicates a commitment to creating well-thought-out and effective regulations. Collaborative Approach: Engaging with stakeholders is vital. It ensures that the legislation considers diverse perspectives and addresses real-world challenges faced by the crypto industry. Why is Crypto Regulation Important? Unlocking the Potential of Digital Assets You might be wondering, why all this focus on crypto regulation ? Well, clear and well-designed regulations are essential for the sustainable growth and mainstream adoption of digital assets . Here’s why it matters: Benefit Explanation Investor Protection Regulation can help protect investors from fraud and manipulation within the crypto market, fostering greater trust and confidence. Market Stability Clear rules can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing volatility and encouraging institutional investment. Innovation and Growth A well-defined regulatory framework can actually foster innovation by providing businesses with the certainty they need to invest and build in the crypto space. Mainstream Adoption For cryptocurrencies to truly go mainstream, they need to operate within a recognized and regulated system, making them more accessible and acceptable to a wider audience. Challenges Ahead in Shaping US Crypto Legislation While the progress is encouraging, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain in the journey towards comprehensive US crypto legislation . Some of these hurdles include: Complexity of Technology: Cryptocurrency technology is complex, and crafting regulations that are both effective and technologically sound requires deep understanding and careful consideration.

The new phase introduces several changes and benefits for users. The most prominent change is to the pricing of the HINU token. During the pre-launch phase, the HINU token price will increase every two days until they sell out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community, ensuring early project backers can benefit from favorable pricing. The HINU token price has already undergone one increase and is set to witness another price jump in 18 hours and 59 minutes. The Pre-Launch Phase The Husky Inu team recently announced several updates, revealing the official launch dates of the HINU token and the Earn App. According to the team, the pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy, rewarding early adopters and project supporters while maintaining growth and transparency. With the pre-launch phase underway, the HINU token’s price will increase every two days, following a compounded growth model until the tokens are sold or it reaches its presale target. The longer the presale lasts, the higher the token price rises. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. Adverse Market Conditions The pre-launch phase begins in extremely adverse market conditions, with major cryptocurrencies in the red. After a brief recovery on Tuesday, markets were back in bearish territory on Wednesday, with volatility also experiencing a substantial uptick. Despite bearishness, BTC has climbed above $80,000 as markets plot yet another recovery. However, the recovery’s sustainability depends on the market’s reaction to China’s announcement that it is increasing tariffs on all imported US goods to 84%. The Chinese embassy in the US announced the decision on X, stating, “China will raise tariffs for all imported US goods from 34% to 84% on April 10.” The move comes after the US increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%. “The US increased the tariff rates to 104 percent on China, which fueled the uncertainty among the market participants, as expected. Bitcoin price slumped hard and is about to drop below $75,000 for the second time this week, raising alarms over the entire crypto market. Market sentiments become extremely fearful, hinting towards a potential bear market.” Meme Coins Rally Meanwhile, meme coins have rallied as market sentiment improves, with top tokens trading in positive territory over the past 24 hours, although they remain in the red over a weekly timeframe. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 10%, crossing $0.150 and trading at $0.156. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is up over 8% and Pepe (PEPE) is up a staggering 14%. Bonk (BONK) is up almost 13%, while Floki (FLOKI) and Dogwifhat (WIF) are up 11.97% and 11.44%. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43147319,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=147968,1744248045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking MIT AI Study: Unveiling the Truth About Machine Learning Values,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mit-ai-study-machine-values/,"Is artificial intelligence (AI) developing its own moral compass? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy readers alike, the rapid advancement of AI is both fascinating and, at times, concerning. Recent discussions have even touched upon whether AI systems are acquiring ‘values’ akin to humans, leading to speculation about AI’s priorities and potential conflicts. However, a groundbreaking new AI study from MIT throws cold water on these sensational notions, suggesting a far more nuanced reality about AI values . Does AI Truly Have Values? The MIT Study Debunks Myths Forget the headlines about AI developing complex ethical frameworks and prioritizing self-preservation over humanity. The MIT research team meticulously investigated several prominent machine learning models from tech giants like Meta, Google, and OpenAI. Their findings? AI, as we currently understand it, doesn’t hold coherent AI values . Instead of possessing ingrained principles, these models appear to be sophisticated imitators, adept at mimicking patterns and responding to prompts, but lacking genuine, stable viewpoints. Key Takeaways from the MIT AI Study: Inconsistency is Key: The study revealed that machine learning models are remarkably inconsistent in their ‘preferences.’ Depending on how questions were phrased, the same AI could adopt wildly different stances on issues, demonstrating a lack of a fixed value system. Imitation, Not Internalization: According to Stephen Casper, a lead co-author, these models are essentially ‘imitators deep down,’ skilled at generating responses based on vast datasets, but not truly internalizing or understanding human-like preferences. Challenge to AI Alignment: The research highlights that ‘aligning’ AI – ensuring it behaves predictably and desirably – might be a significantly greater challenge than previously thought. If AI doesn’t have stable values, guiding its behavior becomes a more complex task. Why This Matters for the Future of Artificial Intelligence This MIT AI study has profound implications, especially as we navigate an increasingly AI-driven world. Understanding the true nature of artificial intelligence is crucial, particularly within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where AI is being explored for various applications, from trading algorithms to cybersecurity. Challenging the Anthropomorphic View of AI Mike Cook, an AI research fellow at King’s College London, supports the MIT team’s conclusions. He points out the common tendency to anthropomorphize artificial intelligence systems, projecting human-like qualities and intentions onto them. It’s vital to distinguish between how AI systems operate – optimizing for specific goals – and attributing human-like motivations or value acquisition to them. Describing AI behavior with overly ‘flowery’ language can lead to misinterpretations and inflated expectations. The Implications for AI Alignment and Safety The concept of AI alignment , ensuring AI systems act in accordance with human intentions and values, is a central topic in AI ethics and development. This MIT research underscores the complexity of this challenge. If AI doesn’t possess inherent, stable values, how do we ensure its long-term safety and beneficial integration into society? Key Questions Raised by the Study: Steerability Concerns: The study questioned whether AI viewpoints could be reliably ‘steered’ or modified. The inconsistent responses suggest that controlling AI behavior might be more difficult than anticipated. Stability and Extrapolability: Casper emphasizes that current machine learning models don’t adhere to assumptions of stability, extrapolability, and steerability. This unpredictability necessitates a more cautious approach to AI development and deployment. Rethinking AI Ethics: The findings prompt us to re-evaluate our approach to artificial intelligence ethics. Instead of focusing on aligning AI with pre-existing ‘values’ it may not possess, we need to concentrate on robust safety measures and ensuring predictable, beneficial outcomes. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Realities of AI So, what does this mean for you, the cryptocurrency and tech-forward reader? It’s a call for a more realistic and less sensationalized understanding of artificial intelligence . While AI offers immense potential, it’s crucial to base our expectations and development strategies on empirical evidence rather than speculative assumptions about AI sentience or inherent values. Practical Steps to Consider: Embrace Critical Thinking: Approach AI-related news and discussions with a healthy dose of skepticism. Distinguish between scientific findings and hyped narratives. Focus on Practical Alignment Strategies: Support research and development focused on verifiable methods for ensuring AI safety and predictability, rather than relying on anthropomorphic models of AI values. Promote Responsible AI Development: Advocate for ethical guidelines and regulations that prioritize transparency, accountability, and human oversight in artificial intelligence development and deployment. Conclusion: A Sobering Yet Essential Perspective on AI Values The MIT AI study delivers a vital, albeit less sensational, message: artificial intelligence , in its current form, doesn’t operate with human-like values. This isn’t necessarily a setback, but rather a crucial clarification. By understanding the true nature of machine learning models – as powerful imitators rather than value-driven agents – we can adopt more effective strategies for AI alignment , safety, and responsible innovation. This grounded perspective is essential for navigating the exciting, yet complex, future of artificial intelligence in all sectors, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

This bold move, initially reported by Yonhap News, offers a temporary reprieve from reciprocal tariffs for nations agreeing not to retaliate against existing U.S. trade measures. But what does this mean for the volatile world of cryptocurrency, and could this be the economic relief the markets have been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details and unpack the potential impact of this significant announcement. Decoding the Tariff Suspension: A Beacon of Hope? The core of Trump’s proposal is straightforward: a 90-day timeout on tariffs for countries choosing not to engage in retaliatory trade actions against the United States. This isn’t just about easing trade tensions; it’s a strategic play that could have far-reaching consequences across the global trade landscape. Here’s a breakdown of what this could entail: Temporary Pause: The most immediate impact is the 90-day suspension itself. This provides businesses and economies a breather from the ongoing trade friction, allowing for potential recalibration and strategic planning. Non-Retaliation Clause: The condition of non-retaliation is crucial. It incentivizes countries to de-escalate trade disputes, potentially fostering a more cooperative international trade environment, at least temporarily. Geopolitical Implications: This move could be interpreted in various ways on the global stage – as an olive branch, a strategic maneuver, or even a sign of changing U.S. trade policy. The geopolitical ramifications are significant and worth watching closely. How Does Tariff Suspension Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? Now, let’s pivot to the question on every crypto enthusiast’s mind: how does a tariff suspension relate to cryptocurrency markets ? The connection might not be immediately obvious, but it’s deeply rooted in the broader economic climate. Here’s how: Reduced Economic Uncertainty: Trade wars and tariffs breed uncertainty. This uncertainty often leads to volatility in traditional markets and, by extension, can influence cryptocurrency markets. A tariff suspension can be seen as a step towards reducing this uncertainty, potentially stabilizing markets and fostering a more positive investment environment. Global Economic Health: Tariffs impact global economic growth. Reduced tariffs can stimulate trade, boost economic activity, and improve overall economic sentiment. A healthier global economy generally translates to increased investor confidence, which can positively affect both traditional and digital asset markets. Risk-On Sentiment: When trade tensions ease, investors may become more inclined to take on risk. Cryptocurrencies, often considered risk-on assets, could benefit from this shift in sentiment. Increased appetite for risk can drive investment into crypto, potentially leading to price appreciation. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical scenario: Scenario Impact on Global Trade Potential Cryptocurrency Market Reaction Escalating Trade Wars (No Suspension) Increased trade barriers, reduced global trade volume, economic slowdown Increased market volatility, potential flight to safety, negative pressure on risk assets like crypto 90-Day Tariff Suspension Temporary easing of trade tensions, potential for increased trade flow, economic stabilization Reduced volatility, potential for increased investor confidence, positive sentiment towards risk assets like crypto Navigating the Market Impact: What to Expect? Understanding the potential market impact of this tariff suspension is crucial for investors and market participants. While the suspension is a positive development, it’s essential to approach it with a balanced perspective. Here’s what to consider: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Effects: The 90-day suspension is, by nature, a short-term measure. While it may provide immediate economic relief and market optimism, the long-term trade policy landscape remains uncertain. Investors should be mindful that this is a temporary pause, not necessarily a permanent resolution. Market Sentiment is Key: The immediate reaction of the market will heavily depend on sentiment. If investors perceive this as a genuine step towards de-escalation and improved trade relations, we could see a positive surge in both traditional and crypto markets. However, skepticism or doubts about the sustainability of this suspension could limit its positive impact. Geopolitical Watch: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments. How other countries respond to this proposal, and whether further trade negotiations ensue, will significantly shape the long-term market impact . Any signs of renewed trade tensions could quickly reverse the positive sentiment. Seizing the Opportunity: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those in the cryptocurrency space, this tariff suspension presents both opportunities and considerations. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Reactions: Closely observe how cryptocurrency markets react to this news. Look for indicators like trading volume, price movements, and shifts in market sentiment. This will provide valuable clues about the immediate impact. Diversify Strategically: While positive news can be encouraging, diversification remains key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global trade news and geopolitical developments. The situation is fluid, and staying informed will enable you to make timely and informed investment decisions. Consider Long-Term Strategy: While short-term gains are enticing, always align your actions with your long-term investment strategy. A 90-day suspension is a temporary event; focus on building a resilient and well-thought-out long-term crypto portfolio. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air or a Fleeting Moment? Trump’s proposal for a 90-day tariff suspension is undoubtedly a noteworthy development in the realm of global trade . Whether it’s a genuine turning point or a temporary respite remains to be seen. For cryptocurrency markets , this news injects a dose of optimism and potential economic relief . However, the crypto world, much like global trade, is dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Prudence, informed decision-making, and a keen eye on evolving geopolitical landscapes will be paramount in navigating the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. This urgent development calls for careful observation and strategic positioning in the ever-exciting world of cryptocurrencies.

Just like in the crypto market where trust and verification are paramount, the AI community faces a similar challenge: ensuring the benchmarks used to evaluate AI are robust, relevant, and truly reflective of real-world performance. OpenAI, a leading force in AI innovation, recognizes this critical need and is taking a bold step forward. They’ve just launched the OpenAI Pioneers Program, a groundbreaking initiative designed to overhaul how we measure AI success, particularly in specific industries. Let’s dive into what this program entails and why it could be a game-changer for the future of AI development and adoption, impacting everything from cryptocurrency algorithms to smart contracts and beyond. Why Current AI Benchmarks Are Broken: The Urgent Need for Domain-Specific AI Evaluation For a while now, whispers of discontent have been circulating within the AI research community regarding the effectiveness of current AI benchmarks . OpenAI isn’t just joining this conversation; they are amplifying it with the launch of the Pioneers Program. The core issue? Many existing benchmarks are simply not cutting it anymore. They often focus on: Esoteric Tasks: Think of AI models acing doctorate-level math problems. Impressive? Yes. Relevant to everyday applications? Not always. These benchmarks often miss the mark when it comes to evaluating practical, real-world AI utility. Gaming the System: Some benchmarks can be ‘gamed’ or optimized for in ways that don’t truly reflect improved general intelligence or practical application. It’s like training for a very specific exam, rather than gaining a broad understanding of a subject. Misaligned Preferences: What a benchmark measures might not align with what users actually value in AI applications. Think about customer service bots – speed might be measured, but what about helpfulness and empathy? The recent stir around LM Arena and Meta’s Maverick model further highlights this problem. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to discern genuine progress and differentiate between AI models based on existing metrics. This lack of clarity is a significant hurdle as AI adoption accelerates across various sectors. Introducing the OpenAI Pioneers Program: A Revolutionary Approach to AI Benchmarks Enter the OpenAI Pioneers Program, a proactive solution aimed at creating domain-specific AI benchmarks. OpenAI’s vision is clear: to develop evaluations that truly “set the bar for what good looks like.” This program isn’t about tweaking existing benchmarks; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how we assess AI performance in real-world contexts. Here’s what makes this program stand out: Focus on Real-World Use Cases: The program will concentrate on creating benchmarks tailored to specific industries like legal, finance, insurance, healthcare, and accounting. This means evaluations will directly address the practical challenges and opportunities within these domains. Industry Collaboration: OpenAI plans to partner with multiple companies, starting with startups, to co-design these benchmarks. This collaborative approach ensures that the evaluations are grounded in real-world needs and challenges faced by businesses. Publicly Available Benchmarks: Transparency is key. The benchmarks developed through the Pioneers Program, along with industry-specific evaluations, will be made public. This open-source approach will benefit the entire AI community and foster wider adoption and improvement. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Opportunity: Participating companies will also get the chance to work with OpenAI’s experts to refine their AI models through reinforcement fine-tuning. This is a powerful technique to optimize models for specific tasks, enhancing their performance in targeted applications. The initial cohort of the Pioneers Program will specifically focus on startups. OpenAI is carefully selecting startups working on “high-value, applied use cases where AI can drive real-world impact.” This strategic focus on startups ensures that the program is working with companies at the cutting edge of AI application, fostering innovation from the ground up. The Promise of Domain-Specific AI Benchmarks: Benefits and Impact What are the potential benefits of shifting towards domain-specific AI evaluation ? The advantages are numerous and far-reaching: Benefit Description More Relevant Evaluations Benchmarks will directly assess AI performance in tasks that matter most to specific industries. For example, a legal benchmark might evaluate an AI’s ability to analyze contracts, while a financial benchmark could assess risk assessment capabilities. Improved Model Development With clearer, domain-relevant benchmarks, developers can focus their efforts on building AI models that are genuinely effective and useful in practical applications, leading to more targeted and impactful AI innovation. Faster AI Adoption Businesses will have greater confidence in adopting AI solutions when they can rely on benchmarks that accurately reflect performance in their specific industry. This can accelerate AI integration across various sectors. Enhanced Transparency and Trust Publicly available, domain-specific benchmarks will increase transparency in the AI field. This can build greater trust in AI technology among businesses and the public, fostering wider acceptance and responsible development. Imagine the implications for the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. AI benchmarks tailored for finance could revolutionize the development of AI-powered trading algorithms, risk management systems for DeFi platforms, or even smart contract auditing tools. By having clear, industry-relevant metrics, innovation in these areas can be significantly accelerated and made more reliable. Navigating the Ethical Tightrope: OpenAI’s Role and Community Trust However, the OpenAI Pioneers Program isn’t without its potential challenges and ethical considerations. The big question looming is: Will the AI community fully embrace benchmarks created and funded by OpenAI? While OpenAI has a history of supporting benchmarking efforts, the fact that they are partnering directly with customers to release these AI evaluation tools raises some eyebrows. Concerns might arise around: Perceived Bias: Will benchmarks developed in collaboration with OpenAI’s partners be seen as inherently biased towards OpenAI’s technologies or preferred approaches? Ensuring impartiality and objectivity will be crucial. Conflict of Interest: Can OpenAI, as a major AI developer, be seen as a neutral and objective entity in setting industry-wide benchmarks? Transparency in the benchmark development process and clear governance structures will be essential to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. Community Ownership: For benchmarks to be widely adopted and trusted, the AI community needs to feel a sense of ownership. OpenAI will need to foster open collaboration and ensure that the program doesn’t appear to be a top-down initiative dictated solely by OpenAI. Addressing these ethical considerations head-on will be critical for the success and widespread acceptance of the OpenAI Pioneers Program. Building trust within the AI community will be just as important as the technical robustness of the benchmarks themselves. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards More Meaningful AI Evaluation The OpenAI Pioneers Program represents a significant and potentially transformative step in the evolution of AI benchmarks . By focusing on domain-specific AI evaluations and fostering collaboration with industry partners, OpenAI is attempting to address a critical gap in the current AI landscape. If successful, this initiative could lead to more relevant, reliable, and ultimately more useful AI models across a wide range of industries, including the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. While ethical considerations and community trust need careful navigation, the potential benefits of this program for the future of AI innovation are undeniable. It’s a bold move that could redefine how we measure AI progress and unlock new levels of real-world impact.

Funding rates dropping below 0.005% are often interpreted as a bearish indicator, suggesting short positions are dominant and traders holding them are willing to pay a premium. Looking at specific assets: ETH shows a funding rate of just 0.0066% on Bitget and -0.0031% on Vertex, a sign of market indecision with a slightly bearish tilt. SOL sees a mixed bag, with 0.0100% on Bitget—bullish—but -0.0062% on Vertex, reflecting hesitation.

43148598,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=728500,1744250416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43148598.jpeg,62.8% Of XRP Realized Cap Held By New Investors: Sign Of Fragility?,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/62-8-of-xrp-realized-cap-new-investors-fragility/,"On-chain data shows a large portion of the XRP Realized Cap is in the hands of investors who got in during the last six months. Here’s what this could mean for the asset. XRP Investors Younger Than Six Months Have Significantly Increased Realized Cap Share In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the Realized Cap of XRP has changed recently. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the total amount of capital that the holders of the asset as a whole have invested into it. Changes in this metric, therefore, correspond to inflows and outflows that the cryptocurrency is observing. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Realized Cap for XRP over the last few years. As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Realized Cap has shot up during the past few months, implying that a large amount of capital has flown into the cryptocurrency. More specifically, the asset has seen the metric double from around $30.1 billion to $64.2 billion. In the same chart, Glassnode has also attached the data of the indicator for the young investor age groups. It would appear that the capital held by cohorts like 1-month to 3 months and 3 months to 6 months has spiked recently, which makes sense considering the growth in the aggregated Realized Cap has come during these windows. According to the analytics firm, this short-term capital spike is a sign of retail-led momentum. The momentum appears to have cooled off, however, as the metric has no longer been growing as sharply recently. A consequence of all the fresh capital inflows is that XRP has seen a shakeup in investor dominance. As another chart shared by Glassnode shows, the new investors, comprising all the age bands under 6 months, have witnessed their Realized Cap share blow up. Prior to the new inflows, this cohort controlled just 23% of the cryptocurrency’s Realized Cap, but today that value has grown to 62.8%. This means that 62.8% of the entire capital invested into the coin has come at price levels of the last six months. Given that XRP is currently trading under the prices that it has been at for most of this window, a lot of these holders would be underwater. “This rapid concentration in new holders reflects strong retail involvement – but also raises the risk of fragility, as many hold elevated cost bases,” notes the analytics firm. From the chart, it’s apparent that these are the same conditions that led to a top during the last two bull markets. With inflows slowing down as the price declines, it’s possible that the same pattern may once again be forming for XRP. XRP Price With a plunge of more than 8% in the last 24 hours, XRP has retraced its latest recovery as its price has returned to $1.78.

The digital asset world is buzzing with a dramatic legal showdown. First Digital Trust (FDT), a prominent Hong Kong-based crypto custodian and the issuer of the FDUSD stablecoin, has officially launched a defamation lawsuit against none other than Justin Sun, the founder of TRON. This isn’t just another day in crypto – this is a high-stakes battle with potentially significant repercussions for the industry. Let’s dive into what’s unfolding and what it all means. Why is First Digital Trust Launching a Defamation Lawsuit Against Justin Sun? The root of this legal storm lies in recent statements made by Justin Sun. He publicly cast doubts on the financial stability of First Digital Trust, suggesting the company was insolvent. These allegations, made across social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), sent ripples through the crypto market, particularly impacting FDUSD. For FDT, these claims weren’t just noise; they were a direct attack on their reputation and business. Defamation, in legal terms, is the act of damaging someone’s reputation through false statements, and that’s precisely what FDT alleges Sun has done. Here’s a breakdown of the key events leading to the defamation lawsuit : Justin Sun’s Allegations: Sun publicly raised concerns about First Digital Trust’s solvency. FDUSD De-pegging: Following Sun’s statements, FDUSD, the stablecoin issued by FDT, experienced a temporary de-pegging from its intended 1:1 USD value, indicating market concern. FDT’s Response: First Digital Trust vehemently denied the insolvency claims and initiated legal action. Summons Filed: FDT officially filed a summons with the Hong Kong High Court, marking the first formal step in the defamation lawsuit . Seeking Injunction: Beyond monetary damages, FDT is seeking an injunction to prevent Justin Sun from making further statements that they deem defamatory. What Does Justin Sun Say About the Lawsuit? Justin Sun , known for his active social media presence and often controversial statements, has responded to the lawsuit with characteristic nonchalance. He stated via X (Twitter) that he “welcomes any legal process.” This seemingly unfazed reaction suggests Sun is prepared to fight the allegations and potentially use the legal proceedings to further his narrative. However, the implications of a formal defamation lawsuit are serious, and Sun’s public bravado might not fully reflect the legal challenges ahead. The Impact on FDUSD and the Crypto Market The immediate aftermath of Justin Sun’s solvency concerns was the de-pegging of FDUSD. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. A de-pegging event erodes trust in the stablecoin and can trigger wider market instability. While FDUSD has since recovered its peg, the incident highlights the vulnerability of stablecoins to reputational attacks and the significant market influence figures like Justin Sun wield. Let’s consider the potential ripple effects: Impact Area Description FDUSD Stability The lawsuit and its outcome will directly impact the perceived stability and trustworthiness of FDUSD. A win for FDT could reinforce confidence; a loss or prolonged battle could create lasting uncertainty. Investor Confidence in First Digital Trust The lawsuit is essentially a fight for FDT’s reputation. Positive resolution can solidify their standing as a reliable crypto custodian ; negative outcomes could damage their credibility. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment High-profile legal battles within the crypto space can contribute to market volatility and uncertainty. This lawsuit adds to the ongoing narrative of regulatory scrutiny and potential instability within the industry. Stablecoin Regulation Debate Events like FDUSD’s de-pegging, triggered by public statements, could fuel further discussions and regulatory focus on stablecoin issuers and the need for stricter oversight. What are the Potential Outcomes of the Defamation Lawsuit? Predicting the outcome of a legal battle is always complex, but we can consider a few potential scenarios for this defamation lawsuit : FDT Wins: The court could rule in favor of First Digital Trust, ordering Justin Sun to cease making defamatory statements and potentially awarding damages to FDT. This would be a significant victory for FDT, reinforcing their reputation and potentially setting a precedent against spreading misinformation in the crypto space. Justin Sun Wins: If Sun successfully defends against the defamation lawsuit , it could embolden him and others to be more outspoken about their criticisms of crypto entities. This scenario might raise concerns about the limits of free speech versus the protection of business reputations in the crypto industry. Settlement: Often, legal battles are resolved through settlements. FDT and Justin Sun could reach an agreement outside of court, which might involve Sun retracting his statements, issuing a public apology, or other terms. A settlement could offer a quicker resolution but might leave some questions unanswered. Prolonged Legal Battle: These types of lawsuits can drag on for months or even years. A protracted legal fight would keep the uncertainty hanging over FDT and FDUSD, and continue to generate headlines, potentially impacting market sentiment. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Users and Investors Watch For? This defamation lawsuit is more than just a spat between two crypto figures. It offers valuable lessons and points to watch for: Monitor Court Proceedings: Keep an eye on updates regarding the lawsuit in the Hong Kong High Court. The court hearings and any rulings will provide crucial insights into the legal arguments and the direction of the case. FDUSD Performance: Track FDUSD’s performance closely. While it has re-pegged, continued scrutiny and market sentiment will influence its stability. Be aware of potential volatility and manage your holdings accordingly. Social Media Influence: This case underscores the immense power of social media and influential figures in the crypto world. Be critical of information spread online, especially when it comes to financial claims. Always do your own research (DYOR). Stablecoin Risks: Remember that even stablecoins are not entirely risk-free. Reputational risks, regulatory changes, and market events can all impact their stability. Diversification and understanding the underlying mechanisms of stablecoins are crucial. Conclusion: A Crypto Showdown with Far-Reaching Implications The defamation lawsuit between First Digital Trust and Justin Sun is a landmark event in the crypto industry. It highlights the growing tensions, the high stakes involved in reputation management, and the potential legal ramifications of public statements in this rapidly evolving space. Whether you’re an investor, a crypto enthusiast, or simply an observer, this legal battle is worth watching. It’s a powerful reminder that even in the decentralized world of crypto, traditional legal principles and reputational integrity still hold significant sway. The outcome will not only shape the future of FDT and FDUSD but could also set important precedents for how disputes are handled and how information is disseminated within the crypto ecosystem.

With the help of modern messaging apps like WhatsApp, paying for cross-border calls and texts is now obsolete. For money transfers, stablecoins might do just that: democratize the payments industry by eliminating historical gatekeepers, says venture firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). ""Just as WhatsApp disrupted costly international phone calls, blockchain payments and stablecoins are transforming global money transfers,"" the firm said in a blog post on Wednesday . The current global payment infrastructure is a complex web involving points of sale, payment processors, acquiring banks, issuing banks, correspondent banks, foreign exchanges, and card networks. Read more: What Is a Stablecoin? To make matters more difficult, each of these intermediaries charges fees and introduces delays, making international transactions cumbersome. For instance, a16z says remittance fees can reach up to 10% — just like cross-border calls or text used to be restrictive before instant messaging apps came into play. Enter blockchain and stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. ""Stablecoins offer a clean-slate alternative. Instead of stitching together clunky, costly, and outdated systems, stablecoins flow seamlessly on top of global blockchains,"" the blog post said. ""Already, stablecoins are slashing the cost of remittances: Sending $200 from the U.S. to Columbia using traditional methods will cost you $12.13; with stablecoins, it costs $0.01."" And, it's not just remittances where stablecoins are eliminating inefficiencies; this could help boost B2B payments on a massive scale, too. A16z uses business transactions from Mexico to Vietnam as an example, which take three to seven days to process and cost anywhere between $14-to-$150 per $1000 transacted. These pass through as many as five intermediaries along the way, each of which takes a cut. The adoption of stablecoin could make such transactions nearly free and instant, it says. Some corporations have taken notice, and Elon Musk's SpaceX is already using stablecoins to manage their corporate treasuries to shield itself from FX volatility. So, it shouldn't surprise anyone to see that the total market cap of stablecoins has passed $200 billion or that the annualized transaction value of stablecoins in 2024 hit $15.6 trillion — roughly 119% and 200% that of Visa and Mastercard , respectively. However, the rise of stablecoins isn't without challenges. Regulatory bodies have scrutinized their use, making it ""incredibly difficult"" to bridge traditional finance to stablecoins, said a16z. The landscape is now finally evolving, as policymakers are now actively shaping rules to recognize and regulate stablecoins in the U.S. ""A forthcoming bill clarifying this regulation could pave the way for even broader adoption and integration into the global financial system,"" the blog said. With the rapidly changing landscape for finance and crypto becoming more mainstream, stablecoins could become the transformative force that revolutionizes the future of money.

The winds of regulatory change might be blowing in favor of blockchain and stablecoins in the United States. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently hinted at a significant shift, suggesting a re-evaluation of existing blockchain regulations that could be stifling innovation. This move signals a potentially more welcoming environment for the burgeoning cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Let’s dive into what this could mean for the future of crypto and the broader financial landscape. Why is the US Treasury Reviewing Blockchain Regulations Now? Secretary Bessent’s announcement at the American Bankers Association conference underscores a growing recognition within the Trump administration of the transformative potential of blockchain technology and stablecoins regulation . The current regulatory framework, while intended to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, may inadvertently be hindering the very innovation it should be nurturing. Several factors are likely driving this re-evaluation: Global Competition: Other nations are actively exploring and implementing crypto-friendly regulations to attract blockchain businesses and investment. The U.S. risks falling behind in this technological race if it maintains overly restrictive policies. Economic Growth Imperative: The administration’s focus on economic growth aligns perfectly with the potential of blockchain and crypto to create new industries, jobs, and investment opportunities. Streamlining regulations could unlock significant economic benefits. Financial Inclusion Goals: Bessent specifically mentioned financial inclusion as a priority. Blockchain and stablecoins offer the promise of expanding access to financial services for underserved populations, a key objective for any administration aiming for broad-based economic prosperity. Industry Advocacy: The cryptocurrency industry has been consistently advocating for clearer and more innovation-friendly regulations. This persistent dialogue seems to be finally resonating with policymakers. What are the Potential Benefits of Reforming Blockchain Regulations? A more balanced regulatory environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation could unleash a wave of positive outcomes for the U.S. economy and its citizens: Boost to Innovation: Clearer guidelines and reduced regulatory hurdles will encourage entrepreneurs and businesses to build and deploy blockchain-based solutions in the U.S., fostering a vibrant ecosystem of innovation. Increased Investment: Regulatory clarity attracts investment. Both domestic and international investors will be more inclined to pour capital into U.S.-based crypto ventures if the rules of the game are well-defined and supportive. Job Creation: A thriving blockchain industry translates directly into job creation across various sectors, from software development and cybersecurity to legal and compliance. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins and blockchain-based payment systems can offer cheaper, faster, and more accessible financial services, particularly for those excluded from traditional banking. Global Leadership in Fintech: By embracing blockchain innovation, the U.S. can solidify its position as a global leader in financial technology, shaping the future of finance on the world stage. Challenges and Considerations for New Regulations While the prospect of regulatory reform is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that policymakers must address to ensure a responsible and effective framework: Challenge Consideration Investor Protection: Regulations must safeguard investors from fraud and scams in the often-volatile crypto market. Money Laundering and Illicit Finance: Robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures are essential to prevent the misuse of cryptocurrencies. Financial Stability: The regulatory framework needs to ensure that the growth of stablecoins and other crypto assets doesn’t pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. Clarity and Consistency: Regulations should be clear, consistent, and applied uniformly across different states and federal agencies to avoid confusion and compliance burdens. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The key is to strike a balance – regulations should be robust enough to address risks but flexible enough to allow innovation to flourish. Scott Bessent and the US Treasury’s Stance Secretary Bessent’s remarks at the American Bankers Association conference offer a glimpse into the US Treasury ‘s evolving perspective on crypto. His emphasis on reviewing regulations that may hinder innovation, coupled with the administration’s broader goal of benefiting both Wall Street and Main Street, suggests a pragmatic and forward-looking approach. The focus on financial inclusion further highlights a commitment to ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements are shared widely. According to Crypto Briefing’s report, Bessent specifically stated that the administration is pursuing reforms for the benefit of U.S. capital markets and aims to create a more balanced regulatory environment. This signals a potential shift away from a purely enforcement-focused approach towards a more proactive and supportive stance towards responsible blockchain regulations and innovation. What Does This Mean for Stablecoins Specifically? Stablecoins regulation is a particularly hot topic within the crypto regulatory landscape. These digital assets, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, have the potential to revolutionize payments and remittances due to their stability and efficiency. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns among regulators regarding their potential impact on monetary policy and financial stability. A positive regulatory review could pave the way for clearer guidelines on: Reserve Requirements: Defining appropriate reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers to ensure they are fully backed by the assets they claim to hold. Issuance and Redemption: Establishing clear rules for the issuance and redemption of stablecoins to maintain transparency and prevent market manipulation. Regulatory Oversight: Determining which agencies should have primary oversight of stablecoin issuers and their activities. If the US Treasury adopts a more supportive stance on stablecoins regulation , it could unlock their potential for mainstream adoption and significantly impact the global payments landscape. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those in the crypto space and traditional finance, here are some actionable insights and things to watch out for in the coming months: Treasury Department Reports: Keep an eye out for any reports or white papers released by the US Treasury regarding their review of blockchain and stablecoin regulations. These documents will provide valuable insights into the administration’s thinking and potential policy changes. Legislative Developments: Monitor legislative activity in Congress related to cryptocurrency and blockchain. New bills or amendments to existing laws could signal the direction of regulatory reform. Agency Guidance: Pay attention to pronouncements and guidance from regulatory agencies like the SEC, CFTC, and FinCEN. These agencies will play a crucial role in implementing any new regulatory framework. Industry Consultations: Engage in industry consultations and discussions with policymakers to contribute to the development of sensible and innovation-friendly regulations. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for Crypto’s Future Secretary Bessent’s announcement is undoubtedly a positive and promising development for the cryptocurrency industry. The US Treasury’s willingness to re-evaluate blockchain regulations and stablecoins regulation suggests a growing understanding of the technology’s potential and a desire to foster responsible cryptocurrency innovation . While the specifics of any regulatory changes remain to be seen, this shift in tone from a key government agency offers a beacon of hope for a more constructive and supportive regulatory environment in the United States. This could pave the way for the next wave of growth and adoption in the crypto space, solidifying the U.S.’s position in the global fintech arena.

As a result, the FDUSD stablecoin briefly de-pegged on April 3 following Sun’s accusations . However, it has since virtually recovered. Moreover, the company requested an injunction to prevent Sun from publishing “similar words” to statements regarding insolvency. First Digital Trust takes Justin Sun’s remarks seriously and files a lawsuit against him Earlier, Tron’s founder Justin Sun initially shared an X post claiming First Digital was insolvent. In addition, he held a press conference in Hong Kong late last week where he accused the company of fraud. This pushed the First Digital Trust to file a lawsuit against Justin Sun for defamation over insolvency allegations. The summons writ, the initial stage of a defamation lawsuit submitted late last week, asked the Hong Kong High Court to grant an order prohibiting Sun from speaking about the issue in the future. Additionally, the company requested an injunction compelling Sun to take back what he previously stated. In addition, First Digital Trust requested the court to issue an award for damages, without stating the exact amount, for causing damage to Plaintiff’s business and unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s contractual and business relationships. An initial court hearing date had not yet been established. Sun did not respond to this; however, he shared an X post that he favored any legal action . Furthermore, Sun’s spokesperson remained silent on the issue. Notably, HCA 680 was the case number in the High Court of Hong Kong. FDT claims that the FDUSD stablecoin has proven to be resilient Following earlier accusations, Sun also mentioned that First Digital Trust also broke Hong Kong’s securities laws. On April 3, FDT stated in a statement on X that they vehemently deny any and all allegations that FDT participated in a coordinated scheme or misappropriation of funds. In the meantime, First Digital reassured customers that it was solvent and that FDUSD was still fully backed and redeemable. Moreover, FDT claimed that Sun and Techteryx, the company that issues the TrueUSD stablecoin, were trying to shift the blame and avoid their responsibilities to manage TUSD reserves appropriately. Based on FDT’s argument, “Techteryx and Justin Sun’s suggestion of First Digital Trust being insolvent is not only factually incorrect, but it is a malicious attempt to damage the reputation and market standing of FDT and stablecoin.” Interestingly, after Justin Sun accused First Digital of being insolvent, the FDUSD depreciated, dropping as low as $0.87. However, the company has since redeemed almost $26 million of stablecoins. Furthermore, First Digital shared another X post highlighting that they kept processing redemptions without issues, proving the FDUSD’s resilience.

With headlines breaking about token unlocks and big-name protocol updates, it’s getting harder to tell which coins are worth the hype and which ones are all smoke. Aptos is staring down the barrel of a major token unlock, while Injective is rolling out tech upgrades that should’ve pumped the price—but didn’t. Things are heating up, and folks in the crypto community are watching closely for the next breakout move. That’s where the hunt for the top cryptos to join for 2025 gets serious. Now, while the usual suspects are scrambling to maintain their footing, a new name is quietly building the rails for blockchain’s next big evolution— Qubetics ($TICS). It isn’t just adding another chain or promising a flashy feature. Qubetics is rewriting how blockchains work together entirely. This Web3 aggregator is stitching networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into one frictionless experience. And it’s not just theory—Qubetics is already deep into its presale with real momentum building. The tech? Game-changing. The price entry? Still early. Let’s break it down. Qubetics Is Solving Blockchain’s Worst Headaches in One Unified System Blockchains are cool—until you try getting them to talk to each other. Right now, a logistics company using Ethereum can’t seamlessly share data with a payment processor running on Solana. A dev building on Avalanche might hit a wall trying to deploy cross-chain smart contracts. And casual users? Forget it. Juggling wallets, interfaces, and swap bridges is enough to push people away. Qubetics solves this nightmare by functioning as a universal Web3 translator. It doesn’t just connect chains—it aggregates them into one smooth ecosystem. This is why Qubetics stands tall among the top cryptos to join for 2025. By eliminating data silos, reducing scalability constraints, and enforcing tight interoperability standards, Qubetics empowers everyone—from NFT artists and DeFi developers to corporate backend engineers—to build, deploy, and operate across multiple blockchains like it’s all one platform. No more friction, no more tech dead-ends. Just clean, user-friendly integration built for how Web3 was always supposed to work. Qubetics Presale: The Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 Are Selling Fast If you’ve been waiting for the right presale to make a move—this is it. The Qubetics presale is now in its 29th stage, and the current price is $0.1573 per $TICS token. With each stage lasting only seven days and ending every Sunday at 12 am sharp, that price rises by 10% like clockwork. Over 507 million $TICS have already been sold, with 24,500+ token holders and a presale tally crossing $15.9 million. That’s not hype—that’s momentum, and it’s building fast ahead of Qubetics’ mainnet launch in Q2 2025. Let’s get real with the numbers. If you get in now and $TICS hits just $1 post-presale, you’re looking at a 535.65% return. At $5? You’re in the 3,078.26% ROI zone. But things get wilder—at $10, that jumps to a jaw-dropping 6,256.47%, and at $15, we’re talking 9,434.71%. For example, a $100 entry right now could earn you $9,540 if $TICS reaches $15. That’s why the Qubetics presale isn’t just another offering—it’s being watched closely by anyone serious about the top cryptos to join for 2025 and looking for that breakout return in the best crypto presale opportunity. Injective’s Major Q1 Upgrades Fall Flat on Price Action Injective has been shipping major tech updates, but the market’s just not responding—yet. In Q1 2025, Injective rolled out native Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support and launched its new Injective AI Index. This index brings together top AI tokens like FET and RNDR along with legacy equity assets like Meta and Nvidia, which is a big step toward integrating traditional markets into DeFi. Still, despite these solid moves, Injective’s price has taken a dive. As of April 8, the coin trades at $7.22, with a 12.64% dip in 24 hours and a full 19.07% drop over the last week. Technical analysis shows bearish pressure isn’t letting up. The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) just crossed below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)—a red flag for momentum. It gets worse: trading volume is shrinking, showing fading interest, and the token now sits in the deep oversold zone. After peaking earlier in the year, Injective’s breakout in January couldn’t hold, and prices have been drifting downward ever since. The protocol’s tech is evolving fast, but the market hasn’t caught up—yet. Aptos Faces Pressure Ahead of $47M Token Unlock Aptos has one of the most anticipated events this week in crypto—and not in the way many hoped. On April 12, it’s scheduled to unlock a whopping $47 million worth of tokens. The problem? That fresh supply could trigger heavy sell-offs from early buyers looking to cash out, potentially driving down the price even further. Token unlocks always shake things up, but when the dollar value is this high, it sends ripples across the market. There’s no sugarcoating it—this kind of unlock could seriously test Aptos’ short-term strength. The community is on edge, watching for signs of a price dip or a mass exodus of liquidity. While Aptos continues to innovate under the hood, the unlock timing has cast a shadow on its momentum. Whether it rebounds post-unlock will depend on how much of that supply actually hits exchanges and how resilient its ecosystem proves under pressure. Why These Coins Matter in the 2025 Crypto Race So what’s the verdict? Injective is dropping major updates but still battling bearish pressure. Aptos has exciting development activity but is caught in the crosshairs of a massive unlock event. Then there’s Qubetics—quietly but powerfully solving blockchain’s biggest usability and interoperability challenges, while building serious traction with a strategic, limited-time presale. If you’re mapping out your next move and eyeing the top cryptos to join for 2025, Qubetics might just be the one project that’s got both the tech and timing in its favor. This could be your best chance to join this best crypto presale before $TICS makes its leap post-mainnet.

43149249,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148003,1744251621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Optimistic Shift: Goldman Sachs Abandons Recession Prediction After Tariff Relief,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/goldman-sachs-recession-tariff-pause/,"In a surprising turn of events, leading investment bank Goldman Sachs has recalibrated its economic outlook, offering a sigh of relief to markets worldwide. Just days after sounding alarms about a potential U.S. recession, the financial giant has withdrawn its forecast. What sparked this dramatic change of heart? It all boils down to a significant pause in tariff implementations by the Trump administration, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X. Let’s dive into the details of this economic U-turn and explore what it means for the US economy and beyond. Why Did Goldman Sachs Initially Predict a Recession? On April 7th, Goldman Sachs raised eyebrows across the financial landscape by increasing its 12-month recession probability for the U.S. economy from 35% to a concerning 45%. This revision reflected growing anxieties about various economic headwinds, including potential impacts from ongoing trade disputes and anticipated tightening of monetary policy. Investors and market analysts closely monitor such forecasts from institutions like Goldman Sachs, as they often influence market sentiment and investment strategies. The initial prediction underscored the fragility of the economic recovery and the potential for unforeseen shocks to derail growth. Here’s a quick look at the timeline: April 7th: Goldman Sachs increases 12-month recession probability to 45%. {{Date of Bloomberg X post}} (Approximate): Trump administration pauses tariff implementation. {{Date of Goldman Sachs withdrawal}} (Approximate): Goldman Sachs withdraws recession forecast. The Game Changer: Tariff Pause and its Economic Implications The central catalyst for Goldman Sachs’ revised outlook is the pause in tariff implementation. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can have a ripple effect across the economy. They can increase costs for businesses, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and reduced corporate profits. In an environment already grappling with inflation concerns, the prospect of new tariffs added another layer of uncertainty and downside risk. By pausing these tariff implementations, the Trump administration has seemingly eased some of the immediate pressures on the US economy, providing a more stable foundation for growth. Consider these potential benefits of a tariff pause: Reduced Inflationary Pressure: Paused tariffs can help prevent further price increases on imported goods, easing inflationary pressures. Business Stability: Companies can operate with more predictability, knowing that input costs are less likely to spike due to new tariffs. Improved Trade Relations: A pause can signal a willingness to negotiate and potentially de-escalate trade tensions, fostering better international economic relationships. What Does This Mean for the US Economy? Goldman Sachs’ withdrawal of its recession call is a significant vote of confidence in the resilience of the US economy . It suggests that while challenges remain, the immediate threat of a sharp economic downturn has diminished. This doesn’t mean the economy is out of the woods entirely, but it does signal a potentially more optimistic trajectory. The pause in tariffs is seen as a crucial factor in mitigating downside risks and supporting continued economic expansion. However, it’s important to remember that economic forecasts are not guarantees, and various factors can still influence the future economic landscape. Key factors influencing the US economy: Factor Potential Impact Inflation High inflation can erode purchasing power and dampen economic growth. Interest Rates Rising interest rates can cool down economic activity and increase borrowing costs. Global Events Geopolitical instability and global economic slowdowns can impact the US economy. Consumer Spending Consumer spending is a major driver of the US economy; changes in consumer behavior can significantly impact growth. Impact on Market Sentiment and Crypto The news from Goldman Sachs is likely to have a positive impact on market sentiment . The removal of a prominent recession forecast can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased investment in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. In the volatile world of crypto, market sentiment plays a crucial role in price movements. Positive news can trigger rallies, while negative news can lead to sell-offs. A more optimistic outlook on the broader economy can create a more favorable environment for crypto adoption and investment. Potential impacts on crypto market sentiment: Increased Investor Confidence: Reduced recession fears can encourage investors to take on more risk, potentially including crypto assets. Positive Price Action: Improved sentiment can lead to increased buying pressure and positive price movements in the crypto market. Broader Market Rally: A general market rally, driven by positive economic news, can often lift the crypto market as well. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do? While Goldman Sachs’ revised forecast is encouraging, it’s crucial for investors to maintain a balanced and informed approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic developments and market analysis from reputable sources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a key strategy to mitigate risk, especially in volatile markets. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to short-term market fluctuations. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand your own risk tolerance and invest accordingly. The withdrawal of the recession forecast by Goldman Sachs is a noteworthy development, offering a glimmer of optimism in uncertain times. While economic challenges persist, the pause in tariffs appears to have provided a crucial buffer, altering the near-term outlook. This shift underscores the interconnectedness of global economics and the significant impact of policy decisions on market sentiment. As always, staying informed and maintaining a strategic approach is paramount for navigating the ever-evolving financial landscape.

Crypto transactions would be taxed at 18% with a 5% military levy on top as part of the proposed framework, released on April 8 by Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission. NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Magomedov said in an April 8 statement that “the issue of crypto taxes is not a hypothesis, but a reality that is fast approaching.” He added that the agency created the framework to help lawmakers make an “informed resolution” by considering each suggestion’s advantages and disadvantages because “these aspects can have a critical impact on the market and tax liability.” Under the NSSMC’s proposed crypto framework, a tax will be applied when crypto is cashed out for fiat currency or exchanged for goods or services. Crypto-to-crypto transactions wouldn’t be taxed, bringing Ukraine in line with other European countries, including Austria and France, as well as crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Singapore, the NSSMC said. The regulator says it “makes sense” to exclude stablecoins backed by foreign currencies or only apply a 5% or 9% tax because Ukraine’s tax code already excludes income from transactions in “foreign exchange values.” A translated excerpt of the NSSMC’s report said stablecoins backed by foreign currencies could be exempt from taxation. Source: NSSMC Mining, staking, hard forks and airdrops Other crypto-related activities, such as mining, staking and airdrops, are also addressed in the framework which floated a few options for taxation. The NSSMC said crypto mining is generally considered a business activity, but there might be a general tax-free limit for certain crypto transactions, including mining. Under the framework, staking could be considered as “business captive income” or only taxed if the crypto is cashed out for fiat currencies. While hard forks and airdrops could be taxed either as ordinary income or when the tokens are cashed. Related: Ukraine officials get training on crypto and virtual assets investigation The regulator suggests a tax-free threshold could help “relieve the burden on small investors” and is common in other jurisdictions. Exemptions for donations, transfers between family members, and holders who keep their crypto for a set amount of time are also flagged as possibilities. However, the NSSMC says the exemption might not apply to non-custodial crypto wallets . Last December, Daniil Getmantsev, head of the tax committee of Ukraine’s parliament, said a draft bill to legalize cryptocurrencies was under review and expected to be finalized early this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy first signed a law establishing a legal framework for the country to operate a regulated crypto market in March 2022.

As confirmed by Ripple executives, the SEC has agreed to return $75 million of the $125 million fine Ripple was ordered to pay last year. That would leave Ripple with just a $50 million payment to settle the case. But here’s the catch: the SEC hasn’t officially confirmed anything yet. Big SEC Meeting Set for April 10 The SEC has a closed-door meeting scheduled for Thursday, April 10. This is expected to be very important because Ripple’s deadline to file its response in the appeal process is just days later — on Wednesday, April 16. If the SEC wants to withdraw its appeal about Ripple’s XRP sales, it will likely need to make that decision during this week’s meeting. Otherwise, the case could continue in court. Legal Expert Says Something Is Coming Soon Attorney Fred Rispoli, who has been following the case closely, said that something will happen before or on April 16. He said there’s a 90% chance the case will settle or the appeal will be withdrawn — and only a 10% chance Ripple will actually have to file its legal brief. On SEC v. Ripple, expect to see something happen on or before next Wednesday, 4/16, the due date for @ripple 's appellate brief. Ripple cannot get an extension and either has to file it (10%) or there will be a notice of settlement/withdrawal (90%). https://t.co/j9z0CpTBQo — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) April 9, 2025 When asked if the SEC had already agreed to end the case, Rispoli said the two sides had likely reached an agreement behind the scenes — but the SEC hasn’t made anything public yet, which is standard for them. Why This Matters The appeal is about whether Ripple’s XRP sales on exchanges were illegal. A judge had ruled they were not securities — a major win for Ripple and the crypto industry. If the SEC officially drops its appeal, it would be a big step toward ending the case for good. What’s Next? All eyes are now on the SEC’s April 10 meeting. If the SEC acts, we could see the legal battle finally come to a close by April 16. Until then, Ripple’s fate — and a key moment for crypto regulation — is still in waiting.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-10 02:26:49

The world of trade just took an unexpected turn, and it could ripple through the cryptocurrency landscape. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, known for his assertive trade policies, has announced a temporary tariff freeze . But what’s behind this surprising move, and how might it impact the volatile world of digital assets? Decoding Trump’s Tariff Freeze: A Shock to the System? According to a recent update from Walter Bloomberg, a respected economic news source on X (formerly Twitter), Donald Trump cited ‘fear’ as the primary driver behind this decision. Yes, you read that right – fear. This is quite a shift from his previously stated stance. Let’s break down what we know: The Fear Factor: Trump reportedly stated that ‘people are afraid,’ leading to his approval of a temporary halt on tariff hikes. While the specifics of this fear remain somewhat vague in the initial reports, it suggests concerns about broader economic instability or market jitters. Temporary Relief: This tariff freeze is described as temporary, implying it’s not a permanent policy shift. The duration and exact conditions are still unfolding, leaving room for speculation and market adjustments. Reciprocal Tariffs (Previously): Trump had earlier proposed a 90-day tariff freeze for countries that refrained from retaliating against U.S. tariffs. The condition included a reciprocal tariff rate of 10%. However, China was explicitly excluded from this concession. It’s unclear if the current ‘fear-driven’ freeze follows the same conditions or represents a modified approach. This announcement injects a dose of uncertainty into the already complex global trade environment. But what does this mean for you, the crypto-savvy investor? Market Fear and Crypto: A Tangled Web Market fear is a potent force in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. When fear grips investors, it can trigger sell-offs, volatility spikes, and shifts in investment strategies. Trump’s mention of ‘fear’ as the basis for the tariff freeze is noteworthy. It suggests an acknowledgment of underlying anxieties within the economic system. Here’s how this could connect to the crypto world: Safe Haven Asset? During times of economic uncertainty and market fear , some investors turn to assets perceived as safe havens. Historically, gold has played this role. Increasingly, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being considered as potential digital safe havens, though this narrative is still evolving and debated. Volatility Catalyst: News related to tariffs and trade policies can inject volatility into financial markets. The crypto market, already known for its price swings, could experience amplified volatility in response to these developments. Traders might see opportunities in this increased volatility, while long-term holders may need to brace for potential turbulence. Economic Indicator: Tariff decisions and the underlying ‘fear’ they reflect can be seen as indicators of broader economic health. If market fear is indeed a significant factor influencing policy decisions, it might signal deeper concerns about economic growth, inflation, or geopolitical stability. These macroeconomic factors can indirectly influence investor sentiment towards both traditional and crypto assets. Global Trade Dynamics and Crypto’s Reach Global trade is the lifeblood of the modern economy, and tariffs are a significant tool in shaping trade relationships between nations. Trump’s tariff policies have been a major factor in reshaping global trade flows in recent years. A tariff freeze , even if temporary, can have ripple effects across industries and economies. Here’s the potential link to crypto: Decentralization Appeal: Cryptocurrencies, by their decentralized nature, operate outside the direct control of governments and traditional financial institutions. In a world where global trade is increasingly influenced by geopolitical tensions and policy shifts, the decentralized and borderless nature of crypto could become more appealing to some. Cross-Border Transactions: Cryptocurrencies facilitate cross-border transactions more easily and potentially at lower costs compared to traditional banking systems. In a dynamic global trade environment, this efficiency could be advantageous for businesses engaged in international commerce, especially if traditional trade routes face disruptions. Emerging Markets Focus: Many emerging economies are heavily reliant on global trade . These regions are also witnessing growing adoption of cryptocurrencies. Tariff policies and shifts in global trade dynamics can disproportionately impact emerging markets, potentially influencing the adoption and usage of crypto as alternative financial systems in these areas. Economic Impact : Will the Freeze Thaw Market Concerns? The economic impact of a tariff freeze is multifaceted and depends on various factors, including its duration, scope, and the broader economic context. While a freeze might offer temporary relief, the underlying issues driving market fear may persist. Here’s a look at potential economic impact scenarios and their crypto implications: Scenario Potential Economic Impact Possible Crypto Market Reaction Temporary Relief & Status Quo Short-term market stabilization, reduced immediate trade tensions. Modest positive reaction, potential for sideways trading as markets await further clarity. Sign of Deeper Economic Concerns If the freeze signals broader economic weakness, it could increase investor anxiety. Increased volatility, potential for both upward (safe haven seeking) and downward (risk-off sentiment) pressure on crypto prices. Shift in Trade Policy If the freeze hints at a more lasting change in trade policy, it could reshape global economic relationships. Longer-term implications, potentially influencing capital flows and investor appetite for different asset classes, including crypto. It’s crucial to remember that the economic impact of this tariff freeze is still developing. Market reactions will likely be driven by evolving information, interpretations of Trump’s motives, and broader macroeconomic trends. Navigating the Tariff Terrain: Actionable Insights So, what should crypto investors and enthusiasts make of this tariff freeze ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to trade policy, economic indicators, and market sentiment. Reliable news sources like Walter Bloomberg and reputable financial media outlets are essential. Manage Risk: Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and events like tariff freezes can amplify it. Implement sound risk management strategies, including diversification and position sizing. Consider Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto space. Decentralization, technological innovation, and growing adoption trends remain powerful forces. Analyze Macro Trends: Pay attention to broader macroeconomic trends, including inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth. These factors can indirectly influence crypto market dynamics. Conclusion: A Pause or a Pivot? Trump’s surprising tariff freeze injects a fresh layer of complexity into the global economic narrative. Whether it’s a temporary truce driven by market fear or a sign of a more significant shift in trade policy remains to be seen. For the crypto market, this development underscores the interconnectedness of global finance and the potential for macroeconomic events to create both challenges and opportunities. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and navigate the evolving landscape with a balanced perspective.

43150206,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=148023,1744253408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Bitcoin Skeptic Roubini Exposes Fed’s Limits in Trump Trade War,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-intervention-trump-trade-war/,"In a market brimming with anticipation for a Federal Reserve (Fed) bailout at every sign of economic turbulence, a prominent voice of caution has emerged. Nouriel Roubini, the New York University professor and well-known Bitcoin skeptic , has thrown cold water on the widespread expectation that the Fed will swoop in to rescue the markets from the fallout of Trump’s trade war. His recent interview has sent ripples through the financial world, particularly among those invested in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Is the safety net we’ve come to expect truly gone? Let’s dive into Roubini’s stark assessment and what it could mean for your investments. Decoding Roubini’s Warning: Is Fed Intervention Off the Table? Roubini’s core message is blunt: don’t count on the Fed to be your knight in shining armor amidst the escalating trade war impact . He argues that the prevalent belief among traders—that the moment things get shaky, the Fed will step in with monetary easing—might be dangerously misplaced this time. Why this shift in perspective? Several factors are at play: Limited Effectiveness of Rate Cuts: Roubini suggests that the traditional tools of monetary policy, like interest rate cuts, may be less potent in addressing the economic disruptions caused by trade tariffs. Trade wars are supply-side shocks that can lead to stagflation (a combination of inflation and economic stagnation), a scenario where simply lowering interest rates might not be the appropriate or effective solution. Fed’s Hesitation to Intervene Prematurely: He points out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is unlikely to jump into action at the first sign of market jitters. Instead, Powell is expected to adopt a wait-and-see approach, possibly waiting for a clearer signal that Trump is willing to de-escalate his trade actions before considering intervention. This delay could leave markets vulnerable to prolonged periods of uncertainty. Moral Hazard Concerns: Constant Fed intervention to bail out markets can create a ‘moral hazard.’ This means market participants might take on excessive risks, anticipating that the Fed will always be there to cushion any downturn. Roubini’s perspective suggests a potential shift away from this predictable pattern of intervention. In essence, Roubini is challenging the ingrained market reflex of expecting immediate Fed support. He’s urging investors to consider a scenario where the central bank’s response might be delayed or less forceful than in the past, especially when dealing with the complexities of a global trade conflict. The Looming Threat of Trade War Impact on Financial Markets The global trade war impact , primarily initiated by the Trump administration’s tariffs, is not just about import duties and export figures. It’s a multifaceted economic challenge that can trigger a cascade of negative consequences across various sectors and markets. Roubini highlights several key areas of concern: Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, leading to increased costs for businesses. Companies may struggle to find alternative suppliers, leading to production bottlenecks and reduced efficiency. This is particularly relevant in industries with complex international production networks. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, which can translate into higher prices for consumers. While some argue that domestic industries might benefit, the immediate effect can be a rise in inflation, eroding purchasing power and potentially slowing down consumer spending. Reduced Business Investment: Uncertainty surrounding trade policies can deter businesses from making long-term investments. Companies may postpone expansion plans, hiring, and capital expenditures until there is more clarity on the trade front. This investment slowdown can dampen economic growth. Global Economic Slowdown: Trade wars can have a contagious effect, impacting not just the countries directly involved but also the global economy as a whole. Reduced trade flows, increased uncertainty, and dampened business sentiment can contribute to a broader economic slowdown, potentially even leading to recessionary pressures. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these broader economic headwinds is crucial. While some view Bitcoin and other digital assets as safe havens during times of economic uncertainty, the reality is far more nuanced. A significant global economic turmoil event can impact all asset classes, including crypto, at least in the short term. Why Bitcoin Skeptic Roubini Doubts Fed Intervention: A Deeper Dive Roubini’s skepticism about the Fed’s willingness or ability to effectively intervene is rooted in his understanding of the current economic and political landscape. Being a known Bitcoin skeptic , his analysis is generally grounded in traditional economic principles, and his views carry weight in mainstream financial circles. Let’s break down his reasoning further: Roubini’s Argument Explanation Trade War is a Supply Shock, Not Just Demand: Traditional monetary policy (rate cuts) is designed to stimulate demand. Trade wars, however, primarily disrupt supply chains and increase costs. Lowering interest rates might not directly address these supply-side issues and could even exacerbate inflationary pressures. Political Constraints on Fed Independence: The Fed is supposed to be politically independent, but in reality, it operates within a political context. Roubini might be suggesting that the Fed could be hesitant to aggressively counter Trump’s trade policies, especially if it’s perceived as directly opposing the administration’s agenda. Limited Policy Space: Interest rates are already relatively low in many developed economies. The Fed has less room to cut rates compared to previous economic downturns. This limited policy space could constrain their ability to effectively respond to a significant economic shock. Risk of Stagflation: As mentioned earlier, trade wars can lead to stagflation. If inflation rises due to tariffs while economic growth slows down, the Fed faces a difficult dilemma. Aggressively easing monetary policy to boost growth could further fuel inflation, while tightening policy to control inflation could worsen the economic slowdown. Roubini’s perspective serves as a stark reminder that the economic challenges posed by trade conflicts are complex and may not be easily resolved by conventional monetary policy tools. His urgent warning encourages a more realistic assessment of the market’s vulnerabilities. Market Instability and the Cryptocurrency Connection The potential for market instability in the wake of trade wars and a potentially less responsive Fed has significant implications for all investors, including those in the cryptocurrency space. While cryptocurrencies are often touted as uncorrelated assets or hedges against traditional market downturns, the reality is more nuanced: Initial Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of heightened market instability , investors tend to move towards cash and perceived safe-haven assets. Initially, this ‘risk-off’ sentiment can negatively impact even cryptocurrencies, as investors reduce exposure to all volatile assets. We witnessed this during the initial market panic of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Longer-Term Inflation Hedge Narrative: If trade wars lead to sustained inflationary pressures, as Roubini suggests is possible, the narrative of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges could gain traction. In this scenario, some investors might turn to crypto as a store of value if they lose confidence in traditional currencies or central bank policies. Correlation with Macroeconomic Events: Cryptocurrency markets, while still relatively nascent, are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic events and global economic sentiment. Significant economic turmoil , such as a global recession triggered or exacerbated by trade wars, could have complex and unpredictable effects on crypto prices. It’s not guaranteed that crypto will act as a safe haven in all scenarios. Regulatory Responses: Economic instability can also prompt regulatory responses from governments and financial authorities. In times of crisis, regulators might become more inclined to tighten control over emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies, which could introduce new challenges and uncertainties for the crypto market. Therefore, while the cryptocurrency market might present unique opportunities, it is not immune to broader economic risks. Understanding the potential for market instability and the complex interplay between macroeconomics and crypto is crucial for informed investment decisions. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights in Times of Economic Turmoil Roubini’s analysis paints a picture of potential economic turmoil and increased market volatility. So, what actionable insights can investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, take away? Diversification is Key: In uncertain times, diversification across asset classes is more important than ever. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s crypto, stocks, bonds, or any other single asset class. A well-diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. Stress-Test Your Portfolio: Consider how your portfolio would perform under different economic scenarios, including a prolonged trade war, market instability , and potential economic turmoil . Understanding your portfolio’s vulnerabilities can help you make informed adjustments. Stay Informed and Agile: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic developments, trade policy announcements, and central bank communications. Be prepared to adjust your investment strategy as the situation evolves. Agility and adaptability are crucial in volatile markets. Manage Risk Prudently: Avoid excessive leverage and risky bets, especially in highly uncertain environments. Focus on risk management and capital preservation. This is particularly relevant in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Consider Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is likely, try to maintain a long-term perspective. Major economic shifts often create opportunities for patient investors who can weather the storm and position themselves for future growth. Roubini’s urgent warning is not necessarily a prediction of doom, but rather a call for realism and preparedness. By acknowledging the potential limitations of Fed intervention and understanding the multifaceted risks of trade wars, investors can navigate the current economic landscape with greater awareness and resilience. In conclusion, Nouriel Roubini’s perspective serves as a crucial counterpoint to the prevailing market optimism regarding Fed intervention. His analysis highlights the potential for prolonged market instability and economic turmoil stemming from trade wars, urging investors to reassess their expectations and strategies. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this means acknowledging that while crypto may offer unique opportunities, it is not immune to broader macroeconomic headwinds. A prudent and diversified approach, coupled with a keen awareness of global economic trends, is paramount in these uncertain times. The era of relying solely on a Fed ‘put’ may be waning, and a new era of market vigilance and strategic adaptation may be upon us.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just given the green light to options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs . This monumental decision marks a significant expansion in the world of ETH-based financial products, offering investors a wider array of tools to engage with the second-largest cryptocurrency. But what exactly does this mean for you, and how will it reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency options trading? Unlocking New Opportunities with Spot Ethereum ETFs Options For quite some time, the crypto community has eagerly awaited the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs . With the SEC’s prior approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the expectation for Ethereum followed suit, and now it’s a reality! This latest development, as reported by Unfolded on X, takes things a step further by enabling options trading on these newly approved ETFs. But why is this such a big deal? Enhanced Investment Strategies: Options provide sophisticated investors with tools beyond simply buying and holding. With cryptocurrency options on spot Ethereum ETFs , investors can now implement strategies like covered calls, protective puts, straddles, and strangles to manage risk, generate income, or speculate on ETH’s price movements with greater precision. Increased Market Liquidity: The introduction of options typically brings more liquidity to the underlying asset. As market makers and traders engage in options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs , it can lead to tighter bid-ask spreads and more efficient price discovery for ETH itself. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: Options are a staple in traditional finance. The availability of cryptocurrency options on regulated spot Ethereum ETFs may further encourage institutional investors who are familiar with options strategies to enter the Ethereum market. This could lead to a significant influx of capital. Accessibility for Retail Investors: While options trading can be complex, the approval of options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs eventually makes these strategies more accessible to retail investors through brokerage platforms that offer ETF trading. Decoding SEC Approval for Ethereum ETF Options The SEC’s approval process for crypto-related financial products has been closely watched and often scrutinized. The fact that they have now approved options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs signals a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto within the traditional financial framework. Let’s break down what this SEC approval really entails: Aspect Details Regulatory Oversight SEC approval means that the exchanges listing these options trading contracts will be subject to regulatory oversight, providing a degree of investor protection and market integrity. Listing Exchanges While the SEC has approved the *concept* of options on spot Ethereum ETFs , individual exchanges still need to file and receive approval to list specific options trading products. Expect announcements from exchanges in the coming weeks and months. Product Complexity Options trading involves derivatives, which are inherently more complex than simply buying and selling the underlying asset (ETH or spot Ethereum ETFs ). Investors need to understand the risks involved, including time decay, volatility, and leverage. Market Maturity This SEC approval is a sign of increasing maturity in the cryptocurrency market. It demonstrates a move towards more sophisticated financial products and a deeper integration with traditional finance. Navigating the Landscape of Cryptocurrency Options Trading on ETH ETFs With the doors now open for options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs , it’s crucial to understand how to navigate this evolving landscape. Here are some key considerations and actionable insights: Education is Key: Before diving into cryptocurrency options , especially on spot Ethereum ETFs , ensure you have a solid understanding of options terminology, strategies, and risk management. Numerous online resources and educational platforms can help. Start Small: If you’re new to options, begin with small positions and gradually increase your trading size as you gain experience and confidence. Choose Reputable Platforms: Select regulated and reputable exchanges or brokerage platforms that will offer options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs once they become available. Look for platforms with robust security measures and clear fee structures. Risk Management is Paramount: Always employ sound risk management techniques when trading cryptocurrency options . This includes setting stop-loss orders, understanding position sizing, and never risking more capital than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and exchange announcements related to options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs . The Future is Bright for Ethereum and Options The SEC approval of options trading on spot Ethereum ETFs is a watershed moment for the crypto industry, particularly for Ethereum. It signifies a significant step forward in legitimizing and integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. While challenges and complexities remain, the availability of cryptocurrency options on spot Ethereum ETFs promises to unlock new opportunities for investors, enhance market efficiency, and potentially drive further institutional adoption of Ethereum. This development is poised to inject a new wave of excitement and sophistication into the world of crypto investing.

It includes presales like ‘FloppyPepe,’ which have generated a lot of interest and are projected to rise meteorically. Meanwhile, the industry stalwarts, Bitcoin (BTC, 80,114.36) and Binance Coin (BNB, $560.86), exhibit stability and robust ecosystem dynamics. One must comprehend these options within the context of the evolving paradigm in order to navigate the futuristic digital landscape. FloppyPepe ($FPPE): AI Ecosystem Explosive Presale Opportunities The use of AI to facilitate engagement within a community digital ecosystem fully empowers users and allows for value creation beyond speculation, which is what sets FloppyPepe ($FPPE) apart. It intends to incorporate AI tools (FloppyAI chatbot, FloppyX video framework), community aspects (a content creation tool, Meme DAO governance), and purposeful tokenomics through a 3% transaction fee structure (charity funding, holder rewards, and token burns). This extensive framework targeting the 120 trillion token supply seeks to cultivate active users and long-term relevance. Primary interest stems from the presale stage at this point. Offering 60% of tokens for early participation and setting ambitious funding targets of $20M and $45M caps, the returns are expected to be mind-blowing. Seeing as the current price is extraordinarily low at $0.0000002, a speculative target of $0.01 would suggest a staggering 4,999,900% ROI. In other words, a $100 investment would theoretically turn into $5 million dollars, a sharp example of the high-risk, high-reward scenario that the FloppyPepe presale focuses on for those wanting exponential returns. Binance Coin (BNB): Ecosystem Dominance BNB’s value, which anchors the Binance ecosystem and trades strongly at the price of $560.86, receives constant development and further utility through fee payment mechanisms. The launchpad has been a major fee-generation utility. Both developments are supportive of HODLer Airdrops (recently featuring Particle Network); rewards demonstrate commitment that strengthens user esteem and shifts BNB into the category of blue-chip crypto assets. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Benchmark Bitcoin , the first ever introduced cryptocurrency, remains a market leader and benchmark, stabilizing around $80,114.36. Arguably, the Turkish tariff announcement was the most recent shock placed on the market, but in the middle of all this turbulence, BTC remained remarkably stable, supporting the narrative for some investors of it functioning as a digital gold store of value. Bitcoin keeps being relevant in any crypto discussion. Weighing Trending Crypto Opportunities Looking at 2025, the heavily marketed cryptos are always compared to leading ones in terms of value against untapped possibilities. For mainstream trusted options like Bitcoin, there are services like FloppyPepe ($FPPE) taking creative approaches to the presale, pricing out the market in hopes of life-changing ROI figures. The risk the FloppyPepes presale offers for higher demand in exponential growth makes for a compelling story, as opposed to the reasons for BTC and BNB’s predictability.

China announced an increase in tariffs on US goods to 84%, which is to take effect on April 10. This represents a direct response to President Donald Trump’s earlier imposition of a 104% tariff on Chinese imports. These tit-for-tat measures have intensified the ongoing trade war between the two largest global economies. How Did Markets React to Conflicting News? Interestingly, while specific US-China tensions worsened, broader financial markets, including crypto, showed slight recovery in the last 24 hours. The rally was in response to news reports from the White House announcing a 90-day pause on other planned US tariff hikes (not related to the active China tariffs).

Several Wednesday filings show investors can now trade options tied to BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), Bitwise Ethereum ETF, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Mini Trust. Options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, ETH in this case, at a predetermined price within a set date. James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that the approval was “100% expected,” and the Commission had until April 9 to decide on the approval. Good news.

Covered call strategy eth ETFs, buffer eth ETFs, etc. https://t.co/Ndqz4cEBQ2 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 9, 2025 SEC’s Delayed Decision Over Ether ETF Options The US financial watchdog’s approval of ETHA options on Wednesday, comes after the agency initially postponed its decision on allowing options. Nasdaq ISE filed for the options on July 22, 2024. Following Nasdaq’s filing on BlackRock’s behalf, a letter from Better Markets, warned the SEC to be careful before allowing options trading for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, citing their high volatility. Last October, the SEC approved options trading on 11 Bitcoin ETFs for NYSE American, Nasdaq, and Cboe Exchange. The recent approvals offer a hedging vehicle for investors to meet their needs in connection with Ether-related products and positions, the Commission’s approval note read. “The Exchange believes that offering options on Ether Funds will benefit investors by providing them with an additional, relatively lower-cost investing tool to gain exposure to the price of Ether.” ETH Price Soars Over 14% on ETFs and Trump’s Tariff Pause Following the SEC’s options approval on the ETH ETFs and the recent 90-day Trump tariff pause , Ethereum price spiked 14% in the past 24 hours. Coinmarketplace data shows that Ethereum is now trading for $1,641 at press time. Per Farside Investors data , the SEC’s approval comes at a time when ETH ETF holders are seeing increased losses. The funds were down over 50% YTD, and the trend has affected ETH ETF flows, which saw only four days of inflows since February 20. On the other hand, two -2x ETH ETFs are the best-performing ETFs so far in 2025, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted. These products represent a 2x leverage short positioning on ETH ETFs. The best performing ETF this year is the -2x Ether ETF $ETHD , up 247%. #2 is the other -2x Ether ETF. I was sure it would be $UVIX (2x VIX), but that's #3.

43150958,https://coinpedia.org/?p=442186,1744254771,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,21 Shares Officially Files For DOGE ETF; Dogecoin Price Soars,https://coinpedia.org/news/21-shares-officially-files-for-doge-etf/,"The post 21 Shares Officially Files For DOGE ETF; Dogecoin Price Soars appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News 21Shares has officially filed to launch a Dogecoin ETF in the U.S., aiming to bring the popular meme coin to Wall Street. The company submitted an S-1 registration form with the SEC and is also awaiting its approval of a 19-b4 filing, both of which are needed before its trading can begin. Notably, the 21 Shares Dogecoin ETF will track the price of DOGE using the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price, giving investors a simple and regulated way to gain exposure to the memecoin without directly needing to hold the asset. 21Shares Joins Grayscale and Bitwise This move comes as Dogecoin bounces back from a sharp sell-off which led to a drop in its price to $0.14. 21Shares becomes the third firm to file for the Dogecoin ETF after Grayscale and Bitwise. The next step is to file a 19b-4 for the fund which will formally begin the approval process with the SEC. Notably, this move comes on the same day as 21Shares launched a Dogecoin ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange, in an ‘exclusive partnership’ with the House of Doge. This ETP is notably the first and only one endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. If the SEC approves the ETF, 21Shares and the House of Doge will collaborate again to promote the fund. Coinbase will serve as the custodian for the fund. This development serves as a bullish outlook for the memecoin which could boost its adotion and drive a surge in its price. Crypto Market Rallies After Trump’s Unexpected Pause Crypto analyst Kevin Capital pointed out a bullish pattern on DOGE’s chart that could signal a potential rebound. While the recent rally may be tied to macro news, specifically Trump’s decision to pause tariffs for 90 days, Kevin noted that the charts had already been hinting at this move. The crypto market saw a rebound after Trump’s announcement with Bitcoin juming to as much as 7.7% to $82,967. While Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP all surged by more than 12%, Solana shot up by an impressive 14%. Paul Atkins Now Confirmed Earlier this year, the firm also filed with the SEC to launch spot ETFs for Polkadot (DOT) and XRP. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart notes that the surge in crypto ETF filings is like a “spaghetti cannon” with companies trying all kinds of ideas to see what the new SEC leadership might approve. The Bloomberg analysts believe there’s a 75% chance that a Dogecoin ETF will get approved this year.

The surge appears to validate BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s Monday prediction that the looming economic uncertainty could create an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Trump Tariff U-Turn Ignites $84K Bitcoin Price Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) entered a 12% rebound on Thursday, was triggered by Trump’s abrupt reversal on sweeping tariffs initially aimed at all U.S. trading partners. The revised trade policy, which now targets a flat 10% tariff (excluding China), eased investor fears of an escalating global trade war. Bitcoin price action, April 10 2025 The crypto market responded swiftly. BTC price soared from an intraday low of $74,700 to peak near $83,600, its strongest single-day move since March. Top altcoins followed in Bitcoin bullish lockstep, with Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Solana and Dogecoin also pulled double-digit gains. Markets Reaction Aligns with Blackrock CEO’s prediction Bitcoin 10% price rebound on Thursday coincided with remarks made earlier in the week by Larry Fink at the Economic Club of New York. When asked about Trump’s tarrifs, warned that broad tariffs could trigger a 20% correction in global markets, but added that such a move would likely present an “incredible buying opportunity.” “I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity,” Blackrock CEO, Larry Fink said, emphasising a positive near-term outlook. With Trump’s early tariff U-turn appears to affirm the Blackrock CEO’s prediction that the trade war turbulence over the past, provides a opportunity for savvy traders to buy the dip. negate one of the key bearish risks, market participants seemed to interpret the event as a green light for reentry—validating Fink’s foresight. Binance sees $1.3B exchange deposits amid two-week turbulence Bitcoin price has endured intense volatility over the past week, as Trump tariffs sparked bearish pressure. However, on-chain data trends suggests that the intra-day see-saw price movements may not be over yet. Bitcoin Exchange Deposits vs. BTC price | Source: CryptoQuant According to CryptoQuant data, total Bitcoin deposits on Binance increased by over significantly since the market turbulence began. As seen above, between March 28 and April 10, Binance BTC deposits rose from 2,419,603 BTC to 2,435,662 BTC. Valued at the current BTC prices around $83,500, it means that investors have deposited 16,059 BTC worth $1,340,926,500 over the last two weeks, i When exchange deposits surge, flashes bearish signals, inflating short-term supply and amplifying volatility. First it hints a broad market anxiety, as investors shift tokens into exchange to enable rapid trade reactions to volatile news signals or seek short-term opportunities to reduce exposure if market sentiment worsens. Until Binance begins to see rapid exchange withdrawals indicating transfers into long-term savings, the elevated BTC deposits in Binance-hosted trading wallets suggest majority of active investors remain primed to react to short-term triggers. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Faces Key Resistance at $88.8K as Traders Eye $100K Milestone Despite the bullish momentum, Bitcoin faces a formidable technical barrier at $88,800—the high from April 2 when the initial tariff news broke. The Keltner channel upper limit on the BTCUSD 12-hour chart currently hovers around $88,130, reinforcing this as a critical resistance zone. This aligns with the recent local top recorded last Wednesday, just before Trump announced the initial sweeping tariffs. Bitcoin price forecast | BTCUSD Given the speed of the rebound, traders who entered at the start of the correction may look to take profits near breakeven levels, creating a sell-wall scenario. Unless BTC breaks through this choke point with strong volume, the path to $100,000 may remain elusive in the near term. Markets are also in a holding pattern as inflation data from both the U.S. and China is set to be released Thursday. A dovish reading could provide the final confirmation for Fink’s thesis and reinvigorate bulls. Bearish Breakdown Could Target $73.5K if Inflation Prints Disappoint While sentiment has turned cautiously optimistic, the risk of retracement looms large if inflation figures exceed expectations. Hawkish surprises could shift monetary policy outlooks, prompting a market-wide pivot toward risk-off assets. The lower Keltner Channel band—currently around $73,500—marks a strong support area and aligns with a liquidity cluster from last week’s consolidation. A breach below $80,000, particularly on heightened selling volume, could accelerate downside momentum. Moreover, the Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) remains negative at -1,888, suggesting the rally has yet to establish firm footing in terms of sustainable trend momentum. Conclusion While the short-term outlook has improved, BTC must overcome the $88,800 resistance to turn $100K from hopeful projection into actionable reality. If inflation data cooperates and investor sentiment remains bullish, the breakout could continue. But a failure to hold the $80,000 level might open the door for a retracement to $73,500, especially if macro headwinds return.

Following the confirmation, Atkins has been cleared to lead a regulatory agency currently undergoing major policy changes, according to Reuters . Atkins, a seasoned SEC veteran and outspoken advocate for the crypto industry, was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed Gary Gensler, who resigned in January following years of conflict with digital asset firms. Atkins served as a SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. Since then, he has led a regulatory consulting firm and advised several financial and crypto startups. He has also co-chaired the Token Alliance, a group promoting blockchain innovation, and even testified in court as an expert witness defending firms sued by the Gensler-led SEC. Ethics filings show that Atkins and his wife hold between $327 million and $588.8 million in total assets, with about $6 million tied to digital assets. Until recently, he held equity and options in Anchorage Digital and Securitize, two major crypto firms, and a $5 million limited partner stake in the crypto investment fund Off the Chain Capital. Now that he is confirmed, he has agreed to divest from all crypto holdings. You might also like: Uniswap, Coinbase, and NYSE execs to join SEC roundtable on crypto trading regulations During his Mar. 27 pre-confirmation hearing, Atkins promised to introduce clear rules for digital assets and reduce political interference in regulatory decisions. He criticized past SEC policies under Gensler as vague and overly aggressive, arguing that they slowed innovation and hurt capital formation. “It’s time to return common sense to the SEC,” he told the Senate panel. The appointment was not without controversy. Senator Elizabeth Warren led the Democratic opposition, citing Atkins’ close ties to the financial industry and his role during the 2008 financial crisis. She warned that putting him in charge of the SEC could weaken investor protections and give too much power to crypto lobbyists. Industry insiders expect Atkins to shift the agency’s focus away from enforcement and toward creating a more supportive environment for crypto innovation. His confirmation comes after acting chair Mark Uyeda and commissioner Hester Peirce recently scaled back the number of lawsuits against crypto companies and reviewed the agency’s approach to digital assets. Atkins’ appointment aligns with the Trump administration’s effort to make the U.S. a global hub for digital assets. With Atkins set to take office soon, many in the industry view this as a sign that blockchain-based financial products will be adopted more widely and that exchange-traded funds approvals will proceed more quickly.

According to an Apr. 9 press release statement , the acquisition marks a huge step for Magic Eden into broader on-chain trading, as interest in non-fungible tokens continues to decline. Slingshot’s technology simplifies cross-chain trading in decentralized finance. Today, users often need to bridge assets, manage multiple wallets, and hold different gas tokens to transact across blockchains. Slingshot streamlines this process with a “ chain abstracted ” experience, enabling users to place spot or limit orders for any token using one non-custodial balance, without worrying about gas or bridges. Magic Eden’s chief executive officer Jack Lu called the acquisition a “major step forward,” saying it aligns with the company’s vision to make trading seamless and accessible. “Pairing Slingshot’s team of product visionaries with Magic Eden’s best-in-class marketing and scaling capabilities accelerates our ability to have an impact on the future of crypto.” — Jack Lu, Magic Eden CEO You might also like: Court approves $11m settlement in Shaquille O’Neal’s Astrals NFT lawsuit Slingshot will continue to operate as an independent platform.

The app won’t launch a token for now, though Magic Eden is exploring ways to bring incentives like referrals and possible ME token integration in the future. The acquisition’s timing is notable. According to DappRadar’s Q1 2025 report , NFT trading volume dropped to $1.5 billion, a 24% decrease from Q4 2024. Sales count fell by 10%, reflecting a slowdown in high-value trades. The global NFT market cap now stands at $3.01 billion, with CryptoPunks alone accounting for 23% of that. In the past 24 hours, the total NFT trading volume was just $4.9 million, as per CoinGecko data . Through Slingshot’s acquisition, Magic Eden seems to be adjusting to this shift, betting on token trading to maintain its dominance . By providing improved discovery tools, fiat onramps like Apple Pay and Venmo, and universal trading balances, the two teams hope to compete with centralized exchanges.

After falling below $80,000 on Sunday, the digital asset has struggled to reclaim upward momentum, reflecting persistent selling pressure in the broader crypto market. While price action continues to dominate headlines, on-chain data reveals deeper shifts in market dynamics. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Onchained highlights a notable transition in Bitcoin ownership patterns. Related Reading: Next Bitcoin Peak Delayed To Late 2026, Business Cycle Expert Warns Bitcoin Short-Term Losses and Long-Term Accumulation In the post titled “Short-Term Capitulation Meets Long-Term Conviction: A Structural Shift in Bitcoin Ownership,” the analyst identified structural changes between short-term and long-term holders, providing insights into the asset’s underlying market behavior. According to the insight, Bitcoin has seen a ~15% drawdown from $88,000 to $74,400 over the past week. On April 7, Short-Term Holders (STH) realized a significant $10 billion drop in their realized cap—a metric reflecting the price at which coins were last moved—marking their largest single-day loss of the cycle. This decline was met with an almost equivalent $9.7 billion increase in Long-Term Holders’ (LTH) realized cap, suggesting a substantial transfer of coins from recent buyers to more experienced holders. By April 8, realized losses from STHs declined to $693 million, indicating a possible exhaustion of panic selling. In contrast, LTHs continued increasing their cost basis by an additional $1.13 billion, reflecting ongoing accumulation despite minimal price recovery. Onchained interprets this as a typical sign of supply transitioning from weaker hands to those with higher conviction, which has historically occurred near market bottoms or early recovery stages. The analyst noted: “This is not merely a coincidence: this is the market transferring coins from weak to strong hands.” Adding: Long-term investors are stepping in with conviction: buying weakness and absorbing supply. – This behavior has historically marked the late stages of corrections or the early phase of recovery. Potential Impact on Market Structure This divergence between STH and LTH behavior may hold broader implications for Bitcoin’s market structure. As STHs reduce their holdings, potential short-term sell pressure and overhead resistance may decline. At the same time, rising accumulation by LTHs suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, even amid current volatility. Historically, similar patterns have preceded stabilization or trend reversals. A shrinking supply in the hands of reactive traders coupled with consistent buying by long-term participants can form the foundation for renewed price support. Whether this shift signals the end of the current correction or an early stage of recovery remains to be confirmed, but on-chain trends continue to suggest meaningful repositioning within the Bitcoin market.

However, another analyst argued that while it could signal an impending sell-off, it might also indicate a bullish trend. Investors are “actively moving funds to Binance” CryptoQuant contributor Maarten Regterschot said in an April 9 post that Binance’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve increased by 22,106 BTC, worth $1.82 billion, over the last 12 days to a total of 590,874 BTC. “This shows a strong acceleration in BTC inflows to Binance. It’s likely that investors are actively moving funds to Binance due to the macro uncertainty and before the upcoming CPI announcement,” Regterschot said. CoinMarketCap shows Bitcoin is trading at $82,474 at the time of publication, up 8.8% in the past day after receiving a boost from Trump’s 90-day tariff pause on all countries but China. Binance’s Bitcoin Reserve has 590,874 Bitcoin. Source: CryptoQuant The US Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to deliver the CPI results for March on April 10. During uncertain times, traders often move their crypto onto exchanges to sell, leading to more volatility as confidence starts to decline. However, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that this isn’t always a bearish signal. “Large inflows could be a sign of selling, but it is a very fluid market. It is plausible that Binance is shifting assets into its hot wallets to meet heavy demand.” “The next few days are critical in understanding the appetite of the market for crypto after Trump’s climbdown on tariffs,” he said. Earlier on April 9, Trump issued a 90-day pause on his administration’s “reciprocal tariffs,” lowering the tariff rate to 10% on all countries besides China, which he ramped up to 125%, citing the country’s counter-tariffs against the US. “Tensions between the US and China remain a structural overhang,” Hundal said. Related: Bitcoin price at risk of new 5-month low near $71K if tariff war and stock market tumult continues Meanwhile, crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said that the March CPI results “will show inflation is crashing down probably close to 2.5%.” “Another interesting day coming,” he added. Crypto analyst Dyme said , “Lower than expected CPI print will send us higher.” However, FactSet’s consensus estimates show economists expect consumer prices to have risen by 0.1% month-over-month in March. On March 12, the CPI came in lower than expected at 3.1% , beating expectations of 3.2%, with a corresponding 0.1% drop in headline inflation figures.

The vote saw 128 in favor, 93 against, and seven abstentions. Libra Meme Coin Scandal According to the report , the committee will have the authority to summon top government officials and demand documentation from public institutions. Key figures expected to testify include Economy Minister Luis Caputo, Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, and Chief of Staff Guillermo Francos. However, there has been criticism regarding the exclusion of President Milei and his sister Karina from the inquiry. Lawmaker Sabrina Selva, in particular, argued that both should be compelled to clarify their involvement in the LIBRA incident. The investigation follows accusations that Milei used his influence to promote the LIBRA meme coin. The token had surged in value to $5 and even briefly reached a market capitalization of $4 billion after President Milei shared details about the token on X. The value, however, collapsed by over 94% once he deleted the post, which sparked suspicions of a pump-and-dump scheme. In response, lawyers Marcos Zelaya and Jonatan Baldiviezo, joined by engineer María Eva Koutsovitis and economist Claudio Lozano, filed a formal criminal complaint on February 17, wherein the individuals accused Milei of fraud for his role in promoting the cryptocurrency. Several critics have also alleged that the project was a “rug-pull” scam, and Milei was accused of misleading investors by using his considerable social media following of 3.8 million. Findings Related to LIBRA On-chain analytics platform Nansen’s report found that 86% of traders who purchased the meme coin lost an estimated $251 million. Only a handful of fortunate investors walked away with profits of more than $180 million. Subsequent investigation by blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps linked LIBRA’s creators to previous pump-and-dump operations and even showed evidence of profits funneled through various wallets, including one connected to MELANIA token creators. Despite this, LIBRA creator Hayden Davis dismissed criticism, claimed that those upset missed out on opportunities, and defended meme coin dynamics.

The move comes days after appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as strategic crypto advisor. Bilal Bin Saqib, the Council’s head and advisor to the finance minister said that the country has been in talks with several Bitcoin mining firms. The location of the Bitcoin mining centre will depend on the availability of surplus power in some regions, he added. “Pakistan is in the top 10 global crypto adopters despite it not being regularised,” Saqib told Reuters , adding that the country has 15-20 million crypto users. Saqib noted that the country aims to foster fintech innovation and growth through regulatory sandboxes, and safe environments for testing. Further, he said that crypto, blockchain and AI upskilling among the country’s youths would foster job creation and economy. This would boost “exports through digital services, positioning the country as a hub for emerging tech talent on the global stage,” he added. Pakistan is consulting with global regulators to build a “Pakistan-first” crypto framework, Crypto Council CEO @Bilalbinsaqib told Cryptonews. #Pakistan #CryptoCouncil https://t.co/GZ9vkwUTo5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 1, 2025 Pakistan’s Challenging Energy Sector The South Asian nation has seen structural challenges in its energy sector over the past years, from high electricity tariffs and chronic overcapacity. Per a 2021 report , Pakistan reportedly generated more electrical capacity than needed. “We are producing much more than we need,” Tabish Gauhar, a special assistant to the prime minister on power, told Reuter at the time. The surplus energy came after the construction of new power plants, largely coal-fired ones funded by China. Per estimates from Ember Energy , Pakistan generates 59% share of electricity from fossil fuels and 41% share of electricity from clean sources, which is above the global average of 39%. Further, the country generates 3% electricity from solar and wind. Global Bitcoin Mining Firms Explore Country’s Potential In a March 25 interview with Bloomberg , Saqib noted that Pakistan is eyeing on global Bitcoin mining firms to utilize its electricity potential. “We welcome companies to visit Pakistan to evaluate for Bitcoin mining,” he said, adding that this is the right time to explore mining options. He also praised the US President Trump, calling him the “biggest, bullish catalyst for crypto in history.” “I think the US sets the tone for the world. Trump is making crypto a national priority and every country including Pakistan will have to follow suit or will be at the risk of being left behind.” The post Pakistan Plans to Utilize Part of Surplus Electricity for Bitcoin Mining: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Mining|Pakistan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|BNB,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-10 03:49:13

The move has injected fresh optimism into markets that have been weighed down by ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty. This development could be the market catalyst many investors were waiting for, potentially signaling the start of a bull run across both traditional and digital assets. Relief Rally: Stocks and Crypto Turn Green Immediately following the tariff pause announcement, U.S. stock indexes rallied sharply. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones all posted significant gains, breaking out of oversold territory with strong green candles on the daily charts. Even gold joined the rally, signaling broader investor relief. In the crypto space, Bitcoin (BTC) surged back above $82,000, marking an 8.87% gain in 24 hours. The move triggered a wave of short liquidations—over $75 million worth—fueling a further price jump. The global crypto market cap now stands at $2.59 trillion, up 8.40% on the day. What’s Next? The 90-day tariff pause runs through the end of June, potentially aligning with historical seasonality in crypto where Q2 often delivers strong gains. April, May, and June have traditionally been favorable months for Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin’s recent performance, especially compared to previous market crashes, has impressed even traditional analysts. Bernstein recently described the current 26% dip as “mild,” especially considering past corrections have reached 50-70%. Many believe this showcases BTC’s growing maturity and institutional support.

In an April 9 letter to New York federal court judge Eric Komitee, Karony’s attorney, Nicholas Smith, said the court should consider an April 7 memo from US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that disbanded the DOJ’s crypto unit . “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” Blanche said in the memo, which added the DOJ “will no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that have the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets.” Blanche also directed prosecutors not to charge violations of securities and commodities laws when the case would require the DOJ to determine if a digital asset is a security or commodity when charges such as wire fraud are available. An excerpt of the letter Karony sent to Judge Komitee. Source: PACER In the footnote of the letter, Karony’s counsel wrote an exemption to the DOJ’s new directive would be if the parties have an interest in defending that a crypto asset is a security, but added that “Karony does not have such an interest.” The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed simultaneous charges of securities violations, wire fraud, and money laundering against Karony and other SafeMoon executives in November 2023. The government alleged Karony, SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and chief technology officer Thomas Smith withdrew assets worth $200 million from the project and misappropriated investor funds. Another attempt to nix the case The letter is Karony’s latest attempt to get the case thrown out. In February, he asked that his trial , scheduled to begin on March 31, be delayed as he argued President Donald Trump’s proposed crypto policies could potentially affect the case. Related: OKX pleads guilty, pays $505M to settle DOJ charges Later in February, Smith changed his plea to guilty and said he took part in the alleged $200 million crypto fraud scheme. Nagy is at large and is believed to be in Russia. SafeMoon filed for bankruptcy in December 2023, a month after it was hit with twin cases from the SEC and DOJ. It was also hacked in March 2023, with the hacker agreeing to return 80% of the funds.
